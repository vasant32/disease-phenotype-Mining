<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have generated a mouse strain carrying a transgene driven by a strong and ubiquitous promoter (human cytomegalovirus hCMV/beta-actin) and containing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) coding sequence upstream of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 3'UTR of t-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is known to be involved in the reversible deadenylation and translational repression of transcripts in mouse oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>hCMV/beta-actin-eGFP-3'UTR t-PA transgenic mice express eGFP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain structures analyzed but lack eGFP fluorescence, with the exception of blood vessels, choroid plexus, and Purkinje cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of these features, we tested whether certain pathological conditions, in particular injuries of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, might trigger eGFP fluorescence in traumatized cells or neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this perspective, we analyzed eGFP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and eGFP fluorescence in experimental models of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system lesions, such as motoneuron axotomy and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found an increase in eGFP fluorescence in specific brain areas in cells suffering or reacting to these injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increased fluorescence is correlated with an increased transcription of eGFP in lesioned cells, presumably enhanced by a release of the translational silencing mediated by the 3'UTR region of the t-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This transgenic mouse model may prove useful to study the development of neurodegenerative lesions </plain></SENT>
