<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experiments aimed to reproduce SEP monitoring during reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in a surgical model of open craniotomy and vessel manipulations in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes of median nerve SEPs were correlated to the degree of local cortical neuronal injury in the forelimb area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on a pilot group (n = 11) both parameters were examined at 2 h after reperfusion in a subsequent study with increase of MCAo time from 1 (n = 7) to 2 h (n = 7); 5 rats were sham operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly delayed and incomplete recovery of SEPs, expressed as a percentage of the mean preocclusion values was observed with 2 h compared to 1 h MCAo (20.8% versus 6.0% change in the latency and 59.5% versus 2.2% in the amplitude of the primary cortical response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was found to correlate consistently with the degree of neuronal damage in 1 and 2 h reversible MCAo (2.5% versus 79.2% severely damaged neuronal types III and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest, that 2 h MCAo followed by 2 h reperfusion produces a submaximal neuronal injury and partial electrical recovery in the periphery of the occluded vascular territory and could be therefore used as a reliable model for assessment of cerebroprotective drug efficacy </plain></SENT>
