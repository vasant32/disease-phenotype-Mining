<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was (a) to establish novel in vivo optical imaging methods for longitudinal assessment of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and (b) to assess size selectivity and temporal patterns of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption after a transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was assessed using in vivo time domain near-infrared optical imaging after contrast enhancement with either free Cy5.5 (1 kDa) or Cy5.5 conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (67 kDa) in mice subjected to either 60- or 20-minute transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and various times of reperfusion (up to 14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo imaging observations were corroborated by ex vivo brain imaging and microscopic analyses of fluorescent tracer extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vivo optical contrast enhancement with Cy5.5 was spatially larger than that observed with BSA-Cy5.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies after a transient 20-minute MCAO suggested a bilateral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, more pronounced in the ipsilateral hemisphere, peaking at day 7 and resolving at day 14 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area differential between the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption for small and large molecules could potentially be useful as a surrogate imaging marker for assessing perinfarct tissues to which neuroprotective therapies of appropriate sizes could be delivered </plain></SENT>
