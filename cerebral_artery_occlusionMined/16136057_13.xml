<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) protects neurons from ischemic brain injury if administered before focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the therapeutic window and functional recovery after NRG-1 treatment in rats subjected to 90 mins of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuregulin-1 (2.5 microg/kg [corrected] bolus, 1.25 microg/kg/min [corrected] infusion) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 89.2%+/-41.9% (mean+/-s.d.; n=8; P&lt;0.01) if administered immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was also evident if NRG-1 was administered 4 h (66.4%+/-52.6%; n=7; P&lt;0.01) and 12 h (57.0%+/-20.8%; n=8; P&lt;0.01) after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuregulin-1 administration also resulted in a significant improvement of functional neurologic outcome compared with vehicle-treated animals (32.1%+/-5.7%; n=9; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of the single administration of NRG-1 was seen as long as 2 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurons labeled with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> marker dye Fluoro-JadeB were observed after MCAO in the cortex, but the numbers were significantly reduced after NRG-1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that NRG-1 is a potent neuroprotective compound with an extended therapeutic window that has practical therapeutic potential in treating individuals after ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
