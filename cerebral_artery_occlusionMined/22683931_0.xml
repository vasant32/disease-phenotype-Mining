<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1) is a member of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase family that plays important roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inflammatory signaling, both of which are critical components of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TAK1 has recently been identified as a major upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major mediator of neuronal injury after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the functional role of TAK1 and its mechanistic link with AMPK after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was injected either intracerebroventricularly or intraperitoneally at various doses and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and functional outcome after long term survival was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice with deletion of the AMPK α2 isoform were utilized to assess the contribution of downstream AMPK signaling to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of pTAK1, pAMPK, and other TAK1 targets including the pro-apoptotic molecule c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and the pro-inflammatory protein cyclooxygenase-2 were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TAK1 is critical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment with a TAK1 inhibitor reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved behavioral outcome even when given several hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This protective effect may be independent of AMPK activation but was associated with a reduction in JNK and c-Jun signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced TAK1 signaling, via activation of JNK, contributes to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TAK1 inhibition is a novel therapeutic approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as it is neuroprotective with systemic administration, has a delayed therapeutic window, and demonstrates sustained neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
