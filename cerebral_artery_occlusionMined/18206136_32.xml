<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interaction between stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 is crucial for homing and migration of multiple stem cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their potential role in mediating BMSC migration in ischemic brain has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, ischemic brain lesion model was created in rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled BMSCs were intravenously injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that BMSCs were able to enter the route from olfactory areas to cortex of the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery of modified Neurological Severity Score was observed at days 14 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the SDF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were predominantly localized in the ischemic penumbral, peaked by 3-7 days and retained at least 14 days post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the CXCR4 expression by BMSCs was elevated under <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pre-treatment with the CXCR4-specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AMD3100 significantly prevented the migration of BMSCs to the injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations indicate that systemically administered BMSCs can migrate to the ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesion of brain</z:e> along with the olfactory-thalamus and hippocampus-cortex route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interaction of locally produced SDF-1alpha and CXCR4 expressed on the BMSC surface plays an important role in the migration of transplanted cells, suggesting that it might be a potential approach to modulate the expression of the two molecules in order to further facilitate the therapeutic effects using BMSCs </plain></SENT>
