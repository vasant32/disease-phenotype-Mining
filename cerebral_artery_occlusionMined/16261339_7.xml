<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the spin trap agent alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> nitrone (PBN), the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 and the MEK1-inhibitor U0126 on focal hyperglycemic ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (90 min) was induced in four groups of rats (PBN, PP2, and U0126 vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological testing and tetrazolium red staining were performed after 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBN decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 70% compared with the control (P&lt;0.05) and a tendency towards reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was seen in the PP2 or U0126 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, neurological testing was consistent with the volumetric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PBN appears to be a potential neuroprotective agent in hyperglycemic, focal ischemic brain injury, while the efficacy of PP2 and U0126 could not be confirmed by the present data </plain></SENT>
