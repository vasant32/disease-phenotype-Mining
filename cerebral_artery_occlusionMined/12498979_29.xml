<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous ebselen (1 mg/kg/h) or vehicle infusion was started 45 min before permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat, and continued until the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The topography and extent of oxidative damage to the brain was assessed immunohistochemically using an antibody for DNA damage that identified hydroxylated products of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17172">2'-deoxyguanosine</z:chebi> (8-OHdG/8-oxodGuo) and an antibody for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation that identified the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> histidine adduct (4-HNE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic damage was mapped and evaluated with standard histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle-treated rats immunopositive staining for both 8-oxodGuo and 4-HNE extended beyond the boundary of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ebselen-treated rats, the extent of tissue immunopositive for 8-oxodGuo, and 4-HNE was less than that demonstrating ischemic damage confirming the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> mechanism of action in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, ebselen treatment induced a 28% reduction in cortical ischemic damage (p &lt;.02) </plain></SENT>
