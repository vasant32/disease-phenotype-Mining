<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that olive extracts suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and reduce stress oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have attempted to determine the effect of dietary olive leaf extract (OLE) on brain lipidomics in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five groups, each consisting of 12 male Wistar rats, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First and second groups (control, and sham) received distilled water, while three treatment groups received oral olive leaf extract (OLE) for 30 days (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours after the last dose, each main group was subdivided to Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-operated and intact subgroup for assessment of neuropathology (neurologic deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume), brain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> analysis and brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OLE increased the brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi>, cholesterol, cerebroside and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> levels in doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OLE increased the brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg/day and OLE reduced the brain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> levels in doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day in comparison to the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although further studies are needed, it seems that the mechanism of OLE-induced ischemic tolerance in rats is partly associated with changes in brain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
