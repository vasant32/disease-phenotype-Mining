<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we postponed the time of cell transplantation to 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female retired breeder rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male BMSCs (3 x 10(6)) or phosphate-buffered saline were administered intravenously, and the animals were killed 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional population of nontreated rats was killed at 1 month after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant recovery of behavior was found in BMSC-treated rats beginning at 1 month after cell injection in the modified neurologic severity score test and the adhesive-removal test compared with control animals (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization showed that BMSCs survived and preferentially localized to the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double staining revealed that approximately 13% and 6% Y-chromosome-positive cells expressed the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the neuronal marker, microtubule-associated protein-2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, BMSC treatment reduced scar thickness, and increased the number of proliferating cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells along the subventricular zone in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of the chemokine stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was significantly increased along the ischemic boundary zone compared with the corresponding areas in the contralateral hemisphere at 1 month and 4 months (P&lt;0.01) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SDF-1 receptor, CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), was expressed in BMSCs both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the time window of BMSC therapy is at least 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the interaction of SDF-1/CXCR4 may contribute to the trafficking of transplanted BMSCs </plain></SENT>
