<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optical reflectance imaging at 550 +/- 10-nm wavelength using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, called optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) in the neuroscience community, provides high resolution imaging of SD waves based on changes in blood perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present optical images of SD waves in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat brain induced by a pinprick, and the spontaneous SD waves that follow middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images of change in reflectance are calculated as A = (I-I(o))I(o), where I is pixel intensity as some timepoint and I(o) is the initial intensity just prior to an SD wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Difference images B = [I(i)-I(i-1)]I(o), where I(i) is the image at time i and I(i-1) is the previous image at time i-1 (a 6.4-s interval), significantly sharpen the boundaries between leading and trailing edges of the SD wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum rate-of-change images C = max(B) display the maximum pixel value of B within the duration of a single SD wave, and provide an image that visualizes the entire penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The penumbra appear bright due to a rapid drop in perfusion, while the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area appear dark </plain></SENT>
