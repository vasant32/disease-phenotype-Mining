<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham operation, model, bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in distal ends of finger and toe, and puncture without bloodletting at these points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> models were established according to Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were taken 48 h after the model was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain water content, brain density, brain coefficient, survival rate, and survival time in each group were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After bloodletting puncture, the survival time of the rats was prolonged, their brain water content and brain coefficient were reduced, and brain density was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bloodletting puncture at Jing-Well points in the distal ends of the finger and toe can improve function in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
