<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The size, location and histology of lesions varied within each time-period of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most animals that underwent long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (eight hours to permanent) had a single, confluent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving deep and sometimes cortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These animals had total <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> chracterized by: 1. indiscriminate involvement of white and gray matter, 2. relatively sharp margins containing astrocytic and mononuclear cells, 3. an inner zone of liquefaction, infiltrated with fat-laden macrophages and newly formed blood vessels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These animals had selective <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> characterized by: 1. involvement of gray matter and relative sparing of white matter, 2. poorly circumscribed, multiple and often perivascular lesions with incomplete tissue destruction, 3. preferential loss of neurons and proliferation of reactive astrocytes and microglia </plain></SENT>
