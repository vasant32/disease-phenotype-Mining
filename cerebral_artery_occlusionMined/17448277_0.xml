<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation group (A group), I/R group (B group), K( ATP) opener treatment group (C group) and K( ATP) opener and blocker treatment group (D group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by intraluminal suture method was used to reproduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and perfusion was restored 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five rats in each group were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain sections were made 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after I/R injury, and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5 triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another five rats in each group were used for assessing the expressions of caspase-3 mRNA and caspase-9 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of apoptotic neurons, the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA and protein in B, C and D groups were significantly higher than A group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of apoptotic neurons, the expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA and protein in C group were significantly lower than B and D groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between B and D groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: K( ATP) opener can significantly mitigate neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibit the expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA and protein after cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that K( ATP) opener can decrease neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by inhibiting mitochondria signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
