<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of animals were compared: those in which blood flow in the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> decreased below the threshold of 10--15 ml/100 g/min (critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and those in which it remained above this level (non-critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In animals with critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, water content in the cortex of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory increased from 80.7 +/- 0.4 to 83.0 +/- 0.3 vol. % (means +/- SE) within 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was associated with an increase in tissue osmolality by 16--22 mosm/kg w.w., and a rise of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> from 262 +/- 9 to 454 +/- 13 meq/kg d.w. and a decrease of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> from 442 +/- 20 to 305 +/- 32 meq/kg d.w </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ratio rose from 0.60 +/- 0.03 to 1.55 +/- 0.17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The water and electrolyte disturbances were accompanied by a major shift of extracellular fluid into the intracellular compartment, as evidenced by the increase in cortical impedance from 282 to 660 ohm/cm within 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the Maxwell equation, this reflects a narrowing of the extracellular space from 19.8 to 11.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain volume was continuously monitored using an induction transducer; swelling began within a few minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and it continued throughout the 4 h observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During this time the blood-brain barrier remained intact as evidenced by the absence of Evans blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was associated with disturbances of the energy producing metabolism, but there was no strict correlation with either <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> or the concentration of high energy phosphates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In animals without critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, i.e. in which blood flow remained above 10--15 ml/100 g/min, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was absent despite a distinct deterioration of the energy state of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was also absent in the border zone, in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery and in the contralateral hemisphere of animals with both critical and non-critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the early ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is of the cytotoxic type, that it develops at a flow rate below 10--15 ml/100 g/min, and that it is not strictly correlated with the energy state of the brain </plain></SENT>
