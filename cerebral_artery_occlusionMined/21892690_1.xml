<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was proposed that its phosphorylation at Ser133 (P-CREB) constituted a convergence point involved in neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether different dosages of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and ketamine could provide neuroprotection against permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced ischemic injuries and the involvement of P-CREB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty adult male BALB/c mice that underwent 6 h MCAO were randomly divided into eight groups: Sham-operation; MCAO + saline; MCAO + 25, 50, 100 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>; and MCAO + 25, 50, 100 mg/kg ketamine (intraperitoneal injection 30 min following MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 50, 100 (not 25) mg/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, and 25 (not 50 and 100) mg/kg ketamine could significantly reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> ratio and neurological deficit (n = 10 per group) as well as inhibit the decrease of P-CREB level in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region when compared with that of MCAO + saline group (n = 6 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the results of double-labeled immunofluorescent staining showed that P-CREB co-localized with neuron-specific marker, NeuN, in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of 50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and 25 mg/kg ketamine treated 6 h MCAO mice (n = 4 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that inhibition of neuron-specific P-CREB dephosphorylation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region is involved in high dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and low dose ketamine-induced neuroprotection of 6 h MCAO mice </plain></SENT>
