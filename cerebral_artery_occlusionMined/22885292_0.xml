<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Octreotide (OCT) has been proved to elicit a variety of biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties in the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in retina and intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However little is known regarding the effect of OCT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we designed this study to investigate the protective effect of OCT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and explore the potential underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) and randomly divided into four groups: Sham (sham-operated), MCAO (pMCAO+0.9% saline), OCT-L (pMCAO+OCT 50μg/kg) and OCT-H (pMCAO+OCT 100μg/kg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCT was administered intraperitoneally immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and brain water content were measured at 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining and western blot were used to analyze the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1 and NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SOD and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> were measured by spectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: Compared with MCAO group, OCT significantly alleviated neurological deficit, lessened <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05), upregulated the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD (P&lt;0.05), and decreased the expression of NF-κB and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: OCT protected the brain against cerebral ischemic damage; this effect may be through upregulation of transcription factor Nrf2, HO-1 and downregulation of NF-κB expression </plain></SENT>
