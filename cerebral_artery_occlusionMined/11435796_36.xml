<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha6beta4 are cellular matrix receptors that may contribute to cerebral microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> alters integrin expression in a characteristic time-dependent manner consistent with neuron injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and various periods of reperfusion on microvasclar integrin alpha1beta1 and alpha6beta4 expression were examined in the basal ganglia of 17 primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Integrin subunits alpha1 and beta1 colocalized with the endothelial cell antigen CD31 in nonischemic microvessels and with glial fibrillary acidic protein on astrocyte fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rapid, simultaneous, and significant disappearance of both integrin alpha1 and beta1 subunits and integrin alpha6beta4 occurred by 2 hours MCAO, which was greatest in the region of neuron injury (ischemic core, Ic), and progressively less in the peripheral (Ip) and nonischemic regions (N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcription of subunit beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> on microvessels increased significantly in the Ic/Ip border and in multiple circular subregions within Ic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microvascular integrin alpha1beta1 and integrin alpha6beta4 expression are rapidly and coordinately lost in Ic after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With loss of integrin alpha1beta1, multiple regions of microvascular beta1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> up-regulation within Ic suggest that microvessel responses to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are dynamic, and that multiple cores, not a single core, are generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes imply that microvascular integrity is modified in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, but ordered pattern </plain></SENT>
