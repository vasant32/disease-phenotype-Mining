<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We review our initial experience with direct percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) as a reperfusion treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients in whom successful thrombolysis might not be expected because of the risk of hemorrhagic complications or reocclusion were treated with direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When early ischemic findings were present on the initial CT scans and/or when lenticulostriate arteries were involved, we performed direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> rather than thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was also performed when superselective local angiography via a Tracker catheter advanced just distal to the occlusion site showed the presence of a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or high-grade stenosis suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed with a Stealth balloon catheter with a maximum diameter of 2.0 to 2.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The balloon catheter was advanced into the site of occlusion and inflated to 2 atm initially, and subsequently up to 3 atm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two to six inflations, each of 30 seconds' duration, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the rate of initial recanalization was 100% (10 of 10), reocclusion occurred in two patients with atherothrombotic M2 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final angiographic success rate of direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was 80% (8 of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no hemorrhagic or technical complications, and five of 10 patients showed marked clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two of seven patients with cardioembolic M1 trunk occlusion, crushed fragments of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> obstructed M2 portions after direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, necessitating local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> may be performed safely as an alternative to thrombolytic therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the middle cerebral artery when early CT findings and/or lenticulostriate artery involvement are present or when superselective local angiography shows the presence of a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
