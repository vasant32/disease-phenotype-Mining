<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a technique for the simultaneous autoradiographic determination of local cerebral pH (LCpH) using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]dimethyloxazolidinedione ([<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DMO) with either local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCGU) using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> ([<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DG) or local CBF (LCBF) using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine ([<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]IAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method evolved from the observation that [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DMO is "unstable," which is shown here to be due to sublimation of the compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the technique consists of administering to rats [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DMO followed by either [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DG or [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first autoradiographic film that results contains both labeled compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain sections are then exposed in a fume hood until the complete disappearance of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DMO, which usually required 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second film thus contains only the non-DMO isotope administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of the two isotopes are calculated from the total concentrations of isotope and the rate of decline of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]DMO in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This information is then used to determine cerebral pH and the other cerebral function of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this double-label technique in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, LCpH, LCGU, and LCBF can be determined with the same accuracy as with single-label techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, this technique yielded LCpH and LCBF values 4 h after occlusion that were not statistically different from those obtained by separate determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, interactions between LCpH and either LCBF or LCGU can be studied by this technique in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
