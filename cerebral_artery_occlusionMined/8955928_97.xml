<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A sensitive quantitative fluorescence method was used to explore the time course and regional pattern of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) opening after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and subjected to 2 h of temporary MCAo by retrograde insertion of an intraluminal nylon suture, coated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>, through the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Damage to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was judged by extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) dye, which was administered either 2, 3, 24 or 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorometric quantitation of EB was performed 1 or 2 h later in six brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> volumes were quantitated from histopathological material at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EB extravasation first became grossly visible in the ipsilateral caudoputamen and neocortex following 3 h of MCAo, was grossly unapparent at 24-26 h, and was maximal at 48-50 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence quantitation confirmed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> opening was absent at 2-3 h but present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> later times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAo, a 179% mean increase in extravasation of EB (compared to sham rats) was measured at 4 h, 407% at 5 h, 311% at 26 h and 264% at 50 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(in each case, P &lt; 0.05 vs. sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The volume of infarcted tissue at 72 h in this model was 163.6 +/- 7.7 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that an initial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> occurs between 3 and 5 h following MCAo, and that a later, more widespread increase in regional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability is present at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regional measurement of Evans Blue extravasation offers a precise means of quantitating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; this method will be of considerable utility in assessing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>-protective properties of pharmacological agents </plain></SENT>
