<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, IVIG has also been shown to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> treatment can provide secondary neuroprotective effects, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> reduction is the underlying cause of the neuroprotective properties of IVIG in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats received either IVIG or placebo and were subjected to temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>24 h after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, clinical evaluation and 7.0T magnetic resonance imaging were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion volume was determined on high-resolution T(2) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T(2) relaxation time and midline shift assessed on magnetic resonance imaging as well as brain water content detected by the wet/dry method after 24 h were measured to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with IVIG leads to a statistically significant reduction of the ischemic lesion volume by 42% after 24 h, as compared to placebo treatment (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three methods for quantifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation indicated no differences between IVIG-treated and untreated animals (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of IVIG is not an indirect result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> reduction, but is caused by direct neuronal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Application of IVIG is a promising treatment concept for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To further investigate this neuroprotective effect, studies on the efficacy, the safety profile and on the underlying mechanisms are required </plain></SENT>
