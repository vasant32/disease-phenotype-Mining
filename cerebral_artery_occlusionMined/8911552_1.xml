<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the somatosensory cortex, the enzyme activity began to increase significantly (p &lt; 0.01) 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and continued to increase up to 3 hours, during which ischaemic cell damage was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the striatum, the enzyme activity increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) 1 hour after MCAO in the absence of morphological evidence of ischaemic cell damage; a peak activity was reached at 2 hours, and began to decline 3 hours after MCAO when moderate ischaemic change was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cortical and subcortical areas, the enzyme activity tended to decrease from 4 hours after MCAO, and was reduced to a level similar to or below that of the non-ischaemic hemisphere 5 hours after MCAO, when severe ischaemic damage was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation of this transient increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase activity in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and the hypermetabolism of neuronal cells during ischaemic insult was discussed </plain></SENT>
