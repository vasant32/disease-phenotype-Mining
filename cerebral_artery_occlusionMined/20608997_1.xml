<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the effect of ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was tested in cultured PC12 cells exposed to Earle's solution containing <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> dithionite, to identify its neuroprotection to PC12 cells damaged by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell injury was detected by the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5 diphenyl-2H tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, male Wistar rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume followed by the treatment with ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results in vitro showed that ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly inhibited PC12 cells damage induced by OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results in vivo showed that vein injection of Ultra-Low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg exerted significant neuroprotective effects on rats with focal cerebral ischemic injury by significantly reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with the injury group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the findings suggest that ultra-low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> might act as a neuroprotective agent useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
