<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of bFGF was observed by fluoro-immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The focal cerebral ischemic injury was carried out using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confocal images demonstrated that both the striatum and the frontoparietal cortex showed increases of bFGF-like IR after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In striatum, the increase patterns of bFGF-like IR were different according to the ischemic extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the core of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and its surrounding region (with more IR induction), bFGF-like IR was mainly located in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In region adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (with most IR induction, the grey ratio of bFGF-like IR increased from sham-98% +/- 10% to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-125% +/- 6%), some neurons also showed an upregulation of bFGF-like IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In frontoparietal cortex, strong induction of bFGF-like IR was mostly seen in neurons (The grey ratio of bFGF-like IR increased from sham-104% +/- 11% to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-132% +/- 28%), although it was observed in astrocytes as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of bFGF increased after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, suggesting that: in striatum, astrocytes may play an important role in the protection of neurons via the overexpression of bFGF; whereas in cortex, neurons probably exert an autoprotection through expressing bFGF themselves </plain></SENT>
