<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During occlusion, blood flow in the auditory cortex was severely suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the fore limb projection area of the somatosensory cortex, blood flow was moderately reduced while it was nearly unaffected in the hind limb projection area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite different degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the 3 cortical areas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evoked responses were completely abolished within 10 minutes after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During permanent occlusion, the pattern of blood flow reduction persisted, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evoked potentials stayed abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recirculation after occlusion restored blood flow rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AEP's recovered poorly after both 1 and 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SEP's regained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amplitudes soon after recirculation in the group with 1-hour occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the recovery of SEP's was variable but better than that of the AEP's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remarkable water accumulation was observed in the auditory cortex of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups and was accompanied in the 2-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group by a disruption of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 2-hour group, water accumulation was also found in the subcortical white matter radiation, whereas significant changes in regional water content were not observed in the somatosensory areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that abolition of SEP's during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in cats is caused by lesions in the afferent pathway leading to cortical deafferentation rather than by cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
