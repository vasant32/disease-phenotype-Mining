<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear how genetic type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) influences <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size when blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is tightly controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of genetic type 1 DM, as occurs in BB rats, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after transient unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in male and female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, studies suggest that male type 1 DM rats have a higher incidence of end-organ complications than do females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second aim of this study was to determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E(2)) administration on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in male BB rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diabetic male (MDiab, n=14) and female (FDiab, n=8) BB rats were studied and compared with background strain Wistar rats (MWist, n=16; FWist, n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two additional male cohorts (MWist+E(2), n=15; MDiab+E(2), n=14) received subcutaneous 25 microg E(2) implants 7 to 10 days before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent 1 hour of MCAO followed by 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables were controlled among groups, and the intraischemic laser Doppler flow signal was reduced similarly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preischemic blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 94+/-5, 127+/-13, 90+/-15, 63+/-18, 122+/-8, and 81+/-14 mg/dL in MWist, FWist, MDiab, FDiab, MWist+E(2), and MDiab+E(2) rats, respectively (mean+/-SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraischemic laser Doppler flow was reduced to 20% to 25% of baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (percentage of ipsilateral caudate putamen) was increased in male diabetic rats relative to nondiabetic MWist rats (41+/-3% versus 28+/-3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Striatal injury was not increased in FDiab rats, and infarction volume was smaller than that in FWist rats (23+/-4% in FWist versus 13+/-3% in FDiab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment reduced cortical and striatal infarction in MDiab+E(2) rats compared with untreated MDiab rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 DM is associated with increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after temporary MCAO, despite tight control of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effect of DM is evident only in males rats; female diabetic BB rats sustain small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> E(2) treatment reduced injury in the male BB rat, providing neuroprotection even in the presence of DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that genetic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> even with mild <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> elevation plays a role in determining neuropathology in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, factors such as reproductive steroids also determine outcome in DM <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
