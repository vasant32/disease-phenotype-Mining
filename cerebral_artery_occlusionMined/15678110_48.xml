<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB is activated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in neurons and glia, but its function is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To inhibit NF-kappaB selectively in neurons and glial cells, we have generated transgenic mice that express the IkappaBalpha superrepressor (IkappaBalpha mutated at serine-32 and serine-36, IkappaBalpha-SR) under transcriptional control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In primary cortical neurons of NSE-IkappaBalpha-SR mice, NF-kappaB activity was partially inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess NF-kappaB activity in vivo after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we measured the expression of NF-kappaB target genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induction of c-myc and transforming growth factor-beta2 by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was inhibited by neuronal expression of IkappaBalpha-SR, whereas induction of GFAP by MCAO was reduced by astrocytic expression of IkappaBalpha-SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuronal, but not astrocytic, expression of the NF-kappaB inhibitor reduced both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 48 hours after permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, the data show that NF-kappaB is activated in neurons and astrocytes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that NF-kappaB activation in neurons contributes to the ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
