<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if these outcomes are dependent on the type and timing of physical rehabilitation and the particular outcome/endpoint being tested, we evaluated the effect of voluntary exercise exposure beginning 24 h after cerebral ischemic injury on behavioral, physiological, and histological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an observer-blinded fashion, Sprague-Dawley (300 g) male rats were allocated to three groups [sham-exercise (SHAM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-exercise (SE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-no exercise (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SNE</z:e>)] before a 1-h right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Running wheels were used for voluntary exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found at 1 week post-infarction between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SNE</z:e> and SE, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SNE</z:e> showing worst neurological scores and higher number of foot faults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, nearly 20% more of the SE animals regained their pre-MCAo weight by 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were not as evident at 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the three groups in the paw preference test, wheel activity, and body temperature, as well as between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SNE</z:e> and SE with regards to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or hemispheric volumes, body weight, synaptophysin staining, and electroencephalography (EEG) testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within-group comparisons showed no relationships between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and foot faults, neurological scores, or exercise level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) unlike behavioral outcomes, physiological and histological outcomes may not be influenced by the introduction of voluntary exercise once lesion maturation has occurred at 24 h, and (2) repetitive outcomes testing can obscure findings in rat models of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
