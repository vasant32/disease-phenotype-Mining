<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine whether 4-HNE was involved in white matter damage in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies detected an increase in cellular and axonal 4-HNE within the ischemic region in the rat after a 24-hour period of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exogenous 4-HNE (3.2 nmol) was stereotaxically injected into the subcortical white matter of rats that were killed 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damaged axons detected by accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) were observed transversing medially and laterally away from the injection site after intracerebral injection of 4-HNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the vehicle-treated animals, axonal damage was restricted to an area immediately surrounding the injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous 4-HNE produced oligodendrocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in culture in a time-dependent and a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4 hours, the highest concentration of 4-HNE (50 micromol/L) produced 100% oligodendrocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data indicate that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and production of 4-HNE occurs in white matter after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation by-product 4-HNE is toxic to axons and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
