<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">Protective agents</z:chebi> that could diminish the injuries induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) are crucial to alleviate the detrimental outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the protective roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi> in cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two-hour <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi> (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle was given to mice intraperitoneally 1h after MCAo and 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were evaluated at 22 h after reperfusion while survival rate was assessed daily until 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brains were cut into 2mm-thick coronal slices and stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded brain sections were prepared for TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein lysate was collected for Western blotting experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher survival rate, better neurological scores, smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were noted in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry data showed a decrease of immunoreactivity of nitrotyrosine, poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) and NFκB in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>-treated brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blotting data showed decreased levels of Cox-2, pERK, and pIκB, but increased levels of Bcl-2, heat shock protein 70 and pAkt in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>-treated brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Post-treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi> protected the brain from I/R injury, probably by its anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi> could diminish the deleterious outcomes of cerebral I/R and may be used as a potential treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
