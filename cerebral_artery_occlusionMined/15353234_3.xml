<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acutobin (0.75 U/ml) was intravenously injected with a dosage of 2.5 U/kg body weight 30 min after MCAO (MCAO duration=60 min) and again 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multislice diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and single-slice dynamic bolus tracking gradient echo (GE) imaging were sequentially acquired before and after MCAO/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI-detected lesion volume was significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced by 24-31% from 350+/-45, 369+/-45 and 374+/-36 mm(3) in the saline-treated group to 239+/-17, 282+/-26 and 259+/-32 mm(3) at 3, 4 and 24 h after reperfusion in the acutobin-treated group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residual cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the right hemisphere recovered and remained at approximately 80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion over the measurement period in the acutobin-treated group, compared to approximately 40% in the saline-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality at 1 week after MCAO/R in the acutobin-treated group was significantly lower (25% mortality) than the saline control group (85% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that acutobin improves brain tissue perfusion and reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and mortality in the hyperglycemic rat MCAO/R model </plain></SENT>
