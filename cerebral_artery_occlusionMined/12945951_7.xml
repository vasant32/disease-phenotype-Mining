<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treadmill training is used for promoting rhythmical vigorous walking and for task-related training in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurological impact of treadmill training has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present investigation is aimed at (1) examining neurological changes over a four-week period after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats and (2) assessing the impact of one-week, two-week and four-week treadmill training in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 60-minute right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were randomly assigned to one of seven groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological score were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats sacrificed 24 hours post MCAO had the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (171.4 +/- 14.4 mm3) and the highest neurological score (median: 2, range: 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We noted that without treadmill training, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes and neurological score diminished with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treadmill training for at least one week further reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and significantly improved neurologic function in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treadmill training after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> significantly improves neurological outcome in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treadmill training may be beneficial for ischemic brain recovery </plain></SENT>
