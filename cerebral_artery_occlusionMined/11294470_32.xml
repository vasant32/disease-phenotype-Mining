<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 3.3% of 10(6) transplanted bone marrow cells were BrdU reactive at 14 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BrdU-reactive cells expressed neuronal and astrocytic proteins, neuronal nuclei protein (NeuN, 1%), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 5%) immunoreactivities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, bone marrow transplantation promoted proliferation of ependymal and subependymal cells, identified by nestin (a neuroepithelial stem cell marker), within the ventricular zone and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that intracerebral transplantation of bone marrow could potentially be used to induce plasticity in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
