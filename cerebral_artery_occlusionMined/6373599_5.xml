<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether infarction and noninfarction outcomes to rapid occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) are differentiated by alteration of the systolic blood pressure (BP), rats under the following conditions were tested: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Wistar rats (NW) made acutely hypertensive with deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (DOCA)-salt, spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats (SHRSP) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication for 7 weeks, and SHRSP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> withdrawn 2 weeks prior to the occlusion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 13 acutely DOCA-salt hypertensive NW were protected from infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adequate collateral circulation was preserved in NW vessels initially formed under normotensive conditions but tested during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DOCA-salt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SHRSP tested had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, SHRSP were more susceptible to infarction than NW made acutely DOCA-salt hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SHRSP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> medication withdrawn for 2 weeks had higher BP and larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than SHRSP maintained on the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that the mechanism causing elevated BP or one secondary to it adversely alters the collateral supply in SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in collateral vascular resistance initiated during anatomical development of the anastomoses very early in life may predispose SHRSP to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after rapid <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion later in life </plain></SENT>
