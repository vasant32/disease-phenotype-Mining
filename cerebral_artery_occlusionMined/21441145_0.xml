<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To gain a better understanding of T cell behavior after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we have developed real-time in vivo brain imaging of T cells by multiphoton microscopy after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male hCD2-GFP transgenic mice that exhibit green fluorescent protein-labeled T cells underwent permanent left distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by electrocoagulation (n=6) or sham surgery (n=6) and then multiphoton laser imaging 72 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extravasated T cell number significantly increased after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> versus sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two T cell populations existed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, possibly driven by 2 T cell subpopulations; 1 had significantly lower and the other significantly higher track velocity and displacement rate than sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The different motilities and behaviors of T cells observed using our imaging approach after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could reveal important mechanisms of immune surveillance for future therapeutic exploitations </plain></SENT>
