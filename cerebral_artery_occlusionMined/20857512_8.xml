<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of Cerebrolysin on neurogenesis in a rat model of embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Cerebrolysin at doses of 2.5 and 5 ml/kg significantly increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU(+)) subventricular zone (SVZ) neural progenitor cells and doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactivity (migrating neuroblasts) in the ipsilateral SVZ and striatal ischemic boundary 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when the treatment was initiated 24 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment also reduced TUNEL(+) cells by âˆ¼50% in the ischemic boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with Cerebrolysin at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg initiated at 24 and 48 hr did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but substantially improved neurological outcomes measured by an array of behavioral tests 21 and 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of SVZ neural progenitor cells from ischemic rats with Cerebrolysin dose dependently augmented BrdU(+) cells and increased the number of Tuj1(+) cells (a marker of immature neurons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway abolished Cerebrolysin-increased BrdU(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Cerebrolysin treatment promoted neural progenitor cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data indicate that Cerebrolysin treatment when initiated 24 and 48 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enhances neurogenesis in the ischemic brain and improves functional outcome and that Cerebrolysin-augmented proliferation, differentiation, and migration of adult SVZ neural progenitor cells contribute to Cerebrolysin-induced neurogenesis, which may be related to improvement of neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
