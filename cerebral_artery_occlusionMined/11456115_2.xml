<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hours of occlusion followed by 22 h of perfusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was performed by inserting a nylon thread into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to occlude it, and pulling the thread to initiate reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of SM-20220 for 1 h reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at doses of 0.2-0.8 mg/kg in a dose-dependent manner without causing changes in the systemic arterial blood pressure or blood gases, when SM-20220 administration was started 1 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of SM-20220 at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg also reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SM-20220 failed to reduce the infarction, even at 1.6 mg/kg, when administration was started 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the therapeutic time window of SM-20220 for this transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model is 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daily administration of SM-20220 (0.4 mg/kg) for the 7 d following 1.5 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume with statistical significance (p&lt;0.05), showing that SM-20220 did not merely delay but prevented ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
