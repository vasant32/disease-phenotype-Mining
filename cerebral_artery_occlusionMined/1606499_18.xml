<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling in conscious rats was used to obtain multiple 50 microliters samples before and up to 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay using a readily available kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volume of infarction was measured by integrating the area of damage on 9 evenly spaced histological sections of the forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This correlated well (r = 0.97, P less than 0.001) with the concentration of CSF neuron-specific enolase integrated over the first 5 days post occlusion, in animals with pure cortical and mixed cortical and striatal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation was maintained in animals given the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a good correlation between the CSF NSE concentration 3 days post-MCAO and the volume of infarction (r = 0.92, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that CSF neuron-specific enolase may be useful as a quantitative marker of ischaemic damage in humans and provide a useful adjunct in the assessment of neuroprotective drugs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
