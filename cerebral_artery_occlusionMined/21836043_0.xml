<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, no promising therapy to protect the brain from ischemic stress to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show an exciting finding that optimal electroacupuncture (EA) effectively protects the brain from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed on rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EA was delivered to acupoints of "Shuigou" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Du</z:e> 26) and "Baihui" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Du</z:e> 20) with different intensities and frequencies to optimize the stimulation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 1) EA at 1.0-1.2 mA and 5-20 Hz remarkably reduced ischemic infarction, neurological deficit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate; 2) the EA treatment increased the blood flow by &gt;100%, which appeared immediately after the initiation of EA and disappeared after the cessation of EA; 3) the EA treatment promoted the recovery of the blood flow after MCAO; 4) "nonoptimal" parameters of EA (e.g., &lt;0.6 mA or &gt;40 Hz) could not improve the blood flow or reduce ischemic injury; and 5) the same EA treatment with optimal parameters could not increase the blood flow in naive brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These novel observations suggest that appropriate EA treatment protects the brain from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by increasing blood flow to the ischemic brain region via a rapid regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings have far-reaching impacts on the prevention and treatment of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, and the optimized EA parameters may potentially be a useful clue for the clinical application of EA </plain></SENT>
