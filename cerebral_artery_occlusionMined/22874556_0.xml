<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that autophagy is involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the neural system during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal autophagy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we and others have shown that immune-related GTPase M (IRGM; termed IRGM1 in the mouse nomenclature) can regulate the survival of immune cells through autophagy in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, using a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) mouse model, we found that IRGM1 was upregulated in the ischemic side of the brain, which was accompanied by a significant autophagic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neuronal autophagy was almost complete lost in Irgm1 knockout (KO) mice after pMCAO induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the Irgm1-KO pMCAO mice was significantly increased as compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological studies suggested that, at the early stage (within 24 h) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the IRGM1-dependent autophagic response is associated with a protection of neurons from <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the ischemic core but a promotion of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate a novel role of IRGM1 in regulating neuronal autophagy and survival during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
