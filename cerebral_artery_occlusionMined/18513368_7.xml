<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Huperzine A, a reversible and selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, has been reported to display neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the protective effects of huperzine A in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> created by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Huperzine A (0.1 mg/kg), administrated intraperitoneally at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion and 6 h later, markedly restored regional cerebral blood flow, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and decreased neurological deficit score at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Along with inhibiting AChE activity, huperzine A inhibited nuclear translocation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B, decreased overexpression of proinflammatory factors in both ipsilateral cortex and striatum, and suppressed activation of glial cells in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit and glial cells activation were also reduced by daily administration of huperzine A for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mecamylamine, a nicotinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor (nAChR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, totally abolished the inhibitory effects of huperzine A on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced glial cells activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, mecamylamine partially reversed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size-reducing effects of huperzine A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that huperzine A exhibits neuroprotective effects against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced brain injury and suggest that the protection mechanism may involve a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, in which nAChR plays an essential role </plain></SENT>
