<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that 1-h MCAO significantly upregulated hippocampal NO and A beta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the NO elevation preceded the A beta changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Western blotting suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoperfusion could increase the expression of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) but not BACE2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced NO concentration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of MCAO/R was coincident with increased eNOS expression, while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage was coincident with increased iNOS and nNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicated that pretreatment of L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, one non-selective NOS inhibitor could decrease the BACE1 expression, reverse both NO and A beta changes and rescue the delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings indicated that activation of NOS/NO signaling system could trigger A beta production through BACE1 pathway during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present data may be important in understanding, at least in part, the pathological role of NO/NOS system involved in hippocampal A beta production and neuronal damage induced by transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
