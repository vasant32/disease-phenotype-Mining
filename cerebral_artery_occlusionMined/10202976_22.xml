<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dexanabinol is a noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-TNFalpha properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty hypertensive rats were subjected to PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight were given 4 mg/kg dexanabinol, i.v., 1 h after PMCAO, eight received vehicle and four were not injected Five rats underwent sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed, as well as TNFalpha concentrations and NOS activity in brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dexanabinol significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also significantly lowered TNFalpha levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere although not to the level of sham operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect could be demonstrated on NOS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, dexanabinol may be a pluripotent cerebroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
