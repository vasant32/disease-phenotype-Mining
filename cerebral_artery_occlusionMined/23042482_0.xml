<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the expression of neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (Nova1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) insults by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The focal cerebral I/R model was induced by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 120 min followed by 1 day, 7 days, and 14 days of reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that Nova1 was expressed in nearly the whole brain, although with higher density in hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, and medial habenular nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of Nova1 neurons was increased dramatically, especially on both sides of the hippocampal CA(1) region, after 1 day of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong response occurred at the ipsilateral CA(1) region between 1 day and 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, strong compensatory responses of Nova1 expression were observed on the contralateral side of the striate cortex, dentate gyrus, and hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, more Nova1 neurons were observed to translocate to the dendrites and growth cones of the axons in the hypothalamus on the ischemic side after 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that Nova1 might mediate neuronal responsiveness, and its expression might positively correlate with neural repair after I/R insults in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
