<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) in traversing the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) in an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) mouse model was established and behavioural and histological analysis was performed, subsequently the carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA)-labelled MNCs were transplanted through the tail vein immediately after 23 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence microscopic analysis of the brain sections was analysed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological deficit was confirmed by TTC staining and contra lateral turning behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 and 7 days of transplantation, the CFDA-labelled MNCs were observed in the infarcted regions along the line of cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of the CFDA-labelled cells in the ischaemic injured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> proved homing of the implanted MNCs in the infarcted regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The successful homing of MNCs may pave way for future clinical trials using MNC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
