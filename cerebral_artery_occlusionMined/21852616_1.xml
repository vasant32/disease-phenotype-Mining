<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Consumption of fish has been shown to reduce risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and, possibly, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) is the most likely neuroactive component within fish oil, we hypothesized that exposing mice to a DHA-enriched diet may reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and protect neurons against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To visualize the effects of DHA on neuroinflammation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, TLR2-fluc-GFP transgenic mice were exposed to either a control diet, a diet depleted in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, or a diet enriched in DHA during 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time biophotonic/bioluminescence imaging of the TLR2 response was performed before and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, whereas cytokines concentrations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> area analyses were performed at 3 and 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that a 3-month DHA treatment prevented microglial activation after ischemic injury, reduced the ischemic lesion size, and increased levels of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis revealed a significant decrease in the levels of COX2 and IL-1Î², but not in other proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, long-term DHA supplementation significantly changed the n-3:n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that diet-induced accumulation of DHA in the brain protects against postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because DHA is widely available at low cost and has an excellent safety profile, our data suggest that increased DHA intake may provide protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> immune response/brain damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
