<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The point correlation dimension (PD2) was used in this study for the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded in patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scalp distribution of the PD2 and that of the P3 event-related potential component was mapped and frequency spectra were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, asymmetrical PD2 distribution was observed with low values on the side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the extension of which depended on recording conditions (level of vigilance) and only partially corresponded to the region characterized by slow frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case, ipsilateral reduction of the P3 wave was caused by a small subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the linear and non-linear methods in localizing brain pathology are evaluated and compared </plain></SENT>
