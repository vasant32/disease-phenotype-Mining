<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that nestin was induced in ischemic core at 1 day after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to ischemic core, the expression of nestin increased in peri-ischemic I, II and III regions at 3 days and 1 week, then it decreased and narrowed along the rim of ischemic core 2 weeks after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that nestin positive cells were mostly co-stained with GFAP,a astrocyte marker, in peri-ischemic I region 3 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks, however nestin cells showed a long process and the cells double stained with nestin and NSE,a neuonal specific marker,increased in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces nestin expression in damaged neurons which might favor the neuroprotection against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
