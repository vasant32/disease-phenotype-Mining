<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) is an attractive procedure that has been used frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, depending on the model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and HBO protocol, different and conflicting results were obtained in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to reevaluate the effects of single administration of HBO in 2 models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>: transient or permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the 2 ischemia models was undertaken to search for a putative therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of single HBO therapy (3 atm absolute, 60 minutes) on transient or permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, when applied at different times (3, 6, or 12 hours) after MCAO, was investigated; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits were assessed at 24 hours and up to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HBO had neuroprotective effects on transient MCAO when HBO was initiated within the first 6 hours, while it aggravated the ischemic injury histologically and clinically when initiated 12 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In permanent MCAO, HBO did not reduce tissue damage regardless of the timing of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HBO is highly efficient in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improving neurobehavioral outcome in transient MCAO within the first 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HBO at later time points (&gt;or=12 hours) is harmful by increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In permanent MCAO, HBO failed to improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
