<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental treatment strategies using human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (hUCB MNCs) represent a promising option for alternative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important point for clinical translation of such treatment approaches is knowledge on the therapeutic time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although expected to be wider than for thrombolysis, the exact time window for hUCB MNC therapy is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to determine the time window of intravenous hUCB MNC administration after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent MCAO and were randomly assigned to hUCB MNC administration at 4, 24, 72, and 120 or 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Influence of cell treatment was observed by magnetic resonance imaging on days 1, 8, and 29 following MCAO and by assessment of functional neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 30, brains were screened for glial scar development and presence of hUCB MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, influence of hUCB MNCs on <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in postischemic neural tissue was investigated in hippocampal slices cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplantation within a 72-h time window resulted in an early improvement of functional recovery, paralleled by a reduction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and diminished glial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation 120 h post-MCAO only induced minor functional recovery without changes in the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> rate and glial reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Later transplantation (14 days) did not show any benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No evidence for intracerebrally localized hUCB MNCs was found in any treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vitro hUCB MNCs were able to significantly reduce postischemic neural <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results for the first time indicate a time window of therapeutic hUCB MNC application of at least 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The time window is limited, but wider than compared to conventional pharmacological approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The data furthermore confirms that differentiation and integration of administered cells is not a prerequisite for poststroke functional improvement and lesion size reduction </plain></SENT>
