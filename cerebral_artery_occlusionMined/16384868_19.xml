<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adrenomedullin (AM) is a vasodilating hormone secreted mainly from vascular wall, and its expression is markedly enhanced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have revealed that AM promotes not only vasodilation but also vascular regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on the roles of AM in the ischemic brain and examined its therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed novel AM-transgenic (AM-Tg) mice that overproduce AM in the liver and performed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 20 min (20m-MCAO) to examine the effects of AM on degenerative or regenerative processes in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> after 20m-MCAO was reduced in AM-Tg mice in association with suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, vascular regeneration and subsequent neurogenesis were enhanced in AM-Tg mice, preceded by increase in mobilization of CD34(+) mononuclear cells, which can differentiate into endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasculo-neuro-regenerative actions observed in AM-Tg mice in combination with neuroprotection resulted in improved recovery of motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was also significantly reduced in AM-Tg mice via suppression of vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, AM exerted direct antiapoptotic and neurogenic actions on neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exogenous administration of AM in mice after 20m-MCAO also reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, and promoted vascular regeneration and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study suggests the neuroprotective and vasculo-neuro-regenerative roles of AM and provides basis for a new strategy to rescue ischemic brain through its multiple hormonal actions </plain></SENT>
