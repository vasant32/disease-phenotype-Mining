<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether drugs that block calcium, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>, free radicals, and endorphin release could modify cerebral blood flow or nerve tissue pathology following a focal cerebrovascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cats were randomly divided into six groups and were subjected to standard middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) performed using a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hour after MCAO, cats received the following compounds intravenously: (i) saline (CS), 1.5 mL/kg or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>, 300 micrograms (CP); (ii) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (NX), 2 mg/kg; (iii) nimodipine (NM), 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 x 60 min; (iv) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DS), 0.9 g/kg in a 40% solution; (v) prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), 200 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min; or (vi) DS-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1-h intervals, local CBF was recorded from the cortical tissue proximal and distal to the MCAO site using the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hours after MCAO, cortical tissue was removed for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> histofluorescence or perfused for tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axon examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NX, NM, CP, or CS had no effect on either CBF or cortical tissue neurotransmitter <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> showed a transiently modest but significant increase of CBF, while DS provided moderate protection of catecholaminergic fibers and increased CBF by 27% after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of DS-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> resulted in significant cytoprotection of cortical catecholaminergic fibers and generated a sustained CBF increase of 68% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that combining DS with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> can yield a synergic effect with respect to cortical neurotransmitter and CBF protection after MCAO </plain></SENT>
