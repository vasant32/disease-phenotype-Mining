<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent pleiotrophic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> which has a trophic role for neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As it exerts its effect only after a conversion to its heterodimeric active form, the activation step, which is catalyzed by an enzyme serine protease named HGF activator (HGFA), is of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HGF activated by HGFA may act as a protecting agent in injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated expression of immunoreactive HGF and HGFA in rat brain after permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemical analysis, HGF and HGFA were normally expressed only in ependymal cells and choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, neurons in the ischemic penumbra region of the cerebral cortex slightly expressed immunoreactive HGFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HGF was not induced at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, however, immunoreactive HGF as well as HGFA became detectable in neurons of the ischemic cerebral cortex and caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for HGF continued to increase until 24 h, while that for HGFA remained almost constant from 3 to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No glial or vascular endothelial cells expressed HGF nor HGFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By Western blot analysis for HGF, a single band of molecular weight (MW) 34 kDa became apparent at 24 h, corresponding to the light chain of the active form HGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that HGF and HGFA were induced in neurons under permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with slightly different temporal profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Through activation by HGFA, the active form of HGF could serve as a neurotrophic factor in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
