<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 120 SD rats were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (n=8), sham operation (n=24), model (CI-R, n=24), EA (n=24) and AE (n=24) groups, and the later 4 groups were further divided into 24 h, 72 h and 120 h subgroups (time-points) separately, with 8 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI-R model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For animals of AE group, the medicinal thread consisting of collagen and Tetramethylpyrazine was implanted into "Dazhui" (GV14) and bilateral "Neiguan" (PC6), once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For rats of EA group, EA (120 cycles/min, 1 mA) was applied to GV14 and PC6 for 30 min, once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the hippocampus were detected by using radio-immunoassay after processing the tissue samples (homogenate, centrifuge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The contents of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in hippocampus tissue of model group at 24 h, 72 h and 120 h time-points were significantly higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and sham operation groups (P&lt;0.05), while after EA and AE, the contents of TNF-alpha at the 3 time-points decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05), and IL-6 contents at the same 3 time-points increased further and significantly (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between EA and AE groups showed that the contents of TNF-alpha of the later group at 72 h and 120 h were significantly lower than those of EA group (P&lt;0.05), while IL-6 contents of AE group were significantly higher than those of EA group at the same time-points (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both EA and AE of collagen and Tetramethylpyrazine can evidently lower TNF-alpha content and significantly raise IL-6 level in hippocampus in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury and the effect of AE is significantly superior to that of EA, which may contribute to their protective effects on ischemic cerebral neurons </plain></SENT>
