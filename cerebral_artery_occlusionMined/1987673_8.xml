<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia, 30 rats had a 3-0 nylon suture introduced through the extracranial internal carotid artery to occlude the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nilvadipine was dissolved in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 400 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately following occlusion, group 1 rats (n = 10) were treated subcutaneously with vehicle and group 2 and 3 rats were treated with 1.0 (n = 10) and 3.2 (n = 10) mg/kg nilvadipine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion fixation was performed 24 hours later, and the histopathologic outcomes were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 28.2 +/- 11.4% of the total cerebral volume; in groups 2 and 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 25.5 +/- 11.6% (NS) and 13.9 +/- 9.2% (p less than 0.05 different from group 1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nilvadipine decreased ischemic neuronal injury in a dose-dependent manner and may be of use in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
