<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 192 healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats, 220-250 g, were used to establish models of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using the suture occlusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Were randomly divided into 8 groups: the rats were intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) ephedrine (ephedrine group), with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (low, moderate and high doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> groups) , with 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) ephedrine + 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (ephedrine + low, moderate and high doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> groups), and with 0.5 mL saline (model group), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1-4 weeks following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, sensorimotor integration in rats was assessed using the beam walking test, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was detected in the hippocampal CA3 area using immunohistochemistry 1-4 weeks after surgery, immunofluorescence method of detecting ischemic hemisphere hippocampal expression, The number of nerve cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected using TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: BWT, BDNF, TUNEL assay results showed three doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group had no significant effect, the effects increased together with the quantitative ephedrine, and had the amount-effect relationship, in which ephedrine + high dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> group the recovery of movement was fastest, BDNF expression in the best and ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampus at least, ischemic injury to the minimum, speed up the process of neural remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ephedrine and ephedrine + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> groups were accelerated motor function recovery rate in rat after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the promotion of neural remodeling is closely related to the expression of BDNF, inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ischemic area, and with the increase of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> amount of additives, its role more clearly, the mechanism may be related to the dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> can significantly inhibit the ischemic area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, so had the positive synergy effect with ephedrine to speed up the formation of neural remodeling </plain></SENT>
