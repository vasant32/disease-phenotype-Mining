<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of the combination of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>) and meloxicam (preferential inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme) against a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats in the weight range of 250-300 g were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized using chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg i.p) and subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg i.p. four times: at the time of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 1.5 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, at the time of reperfusion, and 1 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meloxicam (2.5 mg/kg) was administered 4 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor performance tests (grip test, foot fault test, rotarod performance test, spontaneous locomotor activity), markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were carried out 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A vehicle-treated group was run in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was observed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment improved the motor performance and significantly attenuated the levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) as compared with the middle cerebral artery occluded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meloxicam treatment at the dose used neither showed significant improvement on the motor performance nor decreased the levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> significantly as compared with the middle cerebral artery occluded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when the combination of the two drugs was used, better protection was observed as was evident by the significant decrease in the percent foot fault errors, the increase in the time spent on the rotarod, and the increase in the six-point neurological score and grip test score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant decrease in the levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study demonstrate that enhanced protection is observed with the use of a combination of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> plus meloxicam in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
