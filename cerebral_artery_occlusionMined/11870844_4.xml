<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon occlusion, average CBF fell from about 1.5-2 ml/g/min to below 0.5 ml/g/min in cortical areas and the amygdala, and below 0.2 ml/g/min in the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF in some of the homologous contralateral areas also decreased by 20-30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreased from about 8 center dot 10(-4) to 5 center dot 10(-4) mm(2)/s in the caudate putamen and parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were lower in the frontal cortex and negligible in the piriform cortex, suggesting that the perfusion threshold for <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease may be different for different brain regions in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area of decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> correlated well with the infarction area revealed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining of brain slices in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the mechanisms linking <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and CBF changes to ischemic cell disorders may prove useful in characterizing the degree of tissue damage, and in developing and evaluating treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
