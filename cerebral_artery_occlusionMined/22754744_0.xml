<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It presents as two types: Type I (closed) and Type II (open) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, it may be suspected in the course of ultrasonography, which highlights <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usually, the diagnosis is confirmed postnatally using trans-fontanel ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
