<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Super <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat-models with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were employed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous fluctuations were recorded using a series of gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging (EPI) images before creation of the MCAO, and the same scan protocols were duplicated at the time of 60 min, 2 h after creation of the MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FMRI signal time series from the different ROIs of ischemic cortex and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex were preprocessed and low pass filtered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After preprocessing, the serial fMRI data was obtained by fast Fourier transformation to calculate the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, time course signal changes from a seed voxel of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex were correlated with every voxel in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats to determine the extent of spatial correlation between regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amplitude of LFBF in the ischemic cortex between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz was lightly decreased during the super <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Howerever, the amplitude of LFBF in contralateral cortex was increased after 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spatial distribution of LFBF, from cross-correlation analysis, indicates that the substantial inter-hemispheric synchrony of ischemic region was decreased and of contralateral cortex was enhanced during the super <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The contrast behavior of the resting state BOLD signal fluctuations and a intra-hemispheric symmetry in the LFBF with similar phase characteristics in most other regions during super <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> can be implied a new approach to detect the physiological activity functions and the distinct resting neural networks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> takes place </plain></SENT>
