<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> underwent both PW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT with an interval less than 20 min between the two examinations within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion-to-contralateral relative CBV and CBF ratios measured in multiple regions of interest were compared to evaluate the relationship of the two parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An overall linear relationship was found between relative CBV and relative CBF ratios (R2 = 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two parameters correlated linearly to each other in regions with evolving infarction (R2 = 0.43, p&lt;0.0001), but not in regions without evolving infarction (R2 = 0.001, p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regions with evolving infarction had more severe hypoperfusion (mean relative CBF ratio, 0.38 +/- 0.22) than regions without (mean relative CBF ratio, 0.70+/-0.13) (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant linear relationship existed between relative CBV and relative CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, although relative CBV did not change linearly to relative CBF in mild hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative CBV can be used as an alternative to relative CBF within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, particularly in regions with severe hypoperfusion proceeding to infarction </plain></SENT>
