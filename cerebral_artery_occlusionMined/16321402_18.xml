<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has been postulated to be the major contributor of neuronal injury during reperfusion, inhibition of MMP-9 could be a potential approach in maintaining the viability of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45713">Trans-resveratrol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>), a polyphenolic compound has recently been shown to have neuroprotective activity against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> on MMP-9 induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male Balb/C mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> for 7 days (50 mg/kg, gavage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) was performed for 2 h with the help of intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drug-treated mice showed improvement in necrotic changes in cortex and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection of MMP-9 activity and gene expression was performed at various time points after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of MMP-9 were significantly attenuated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>-treated mice as compared to the vehicle MCAo mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> has protective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which could be attributed to its property against MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> may be a potential agent for the treatment of neuronal injury associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
