<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were separated into two groups with similar infarction sizes, measured by magnetic resonance imaging on day 2 after MCAo, and were treated with CART or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CART treatment increased CART level in the brain, improved behavioral recovery, and reduced neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the subventricular zone (SVZ), CART enhanced immunolabeling of bromodeoxyuridine, a neural progenitor cell marker Musashi-1, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, as well as upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AAV-GFP was locally applied to the SVZ to examine migration of SVZ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CART enhanced migration of GFP(+) cells from SVZ toward the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SVZ culture, CART increased the size of neurospheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CART-mediated cell migration from SVZ explants was reduced by anti-BDNF blocking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using (1)H-MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy), increases in N-acetylaspartate levels were found in the lesioned cortex after CART treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cocaine- and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-regulated transcript increased the expression of GAP43 and fluoro-ruby fluorescence in the lesioned cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that intranasal CART treatment facilitates neuroregeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 5 December 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.172 </plain></SENT>
