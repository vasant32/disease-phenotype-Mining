<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with or without Niaspan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Niaspan significantly elevated local cerebral blood flow, and increased arteriogenesis as indicated by increased arterial diameter and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in the ischemic brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased arteriogenesis significantly correlated with the functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Niaspan treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> upregulated TACE, Notch1, and Notch intracellular domain expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the mechanisms of Niaspan-induced arteriogenesis, a primary brain arterial culture was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Niacin treatment significantly increased arterial sprouting and VSMC migration compared with control nontreated arterial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of TACE by the TACE inhibitor or knockdown of TACE gene expression in brain arterial culture significantly attenuated Niacin-induced arterial sprouting and VSMC migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, TACE treatment of arterial culture significantly increased arterial VSMC migration and arterial sprouting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Notch1 marginally decreased arterial sprouting and VSMC migration compared with scrambled control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Niaspan promotes arteriogenesis, which is mediated, in part, by TACE </plain></SENT>
