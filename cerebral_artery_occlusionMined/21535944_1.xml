<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate recombinant human TIMP-1 ((125)I-rhTIMP-1) half-life in blood and its distribution in rat brain tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion as part of a therapeutic development paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A suture model of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(125)I-labeled rhTIMP-1 at 60 μg/kg (11.23 μCi/μg) was administered to rats intravenously at the beginning of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and brain tissue were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The radioactivity was detected with a gamma counter and analyzed by autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood half-life T(1/2) of (125)I-rhTIMP-1 was 42.2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after (125)I-rhTIMP-1 administration, an increased accumulation of (125)I-rhTIMP-1 in the ischemic hemisphere was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum brain tissue concentration C(max) was 26.1 ng/g at 1.5 hours in the striatum and 13.9 ng/g at 5 hours in the cortex when the uptake percentage of brain tissue to blood was 6.1±0.4 and 6.7±2.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cortex and striatum elimination half-lives T(1/2) were 45.3 and 39.2 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic analysis of ischemic samples for (125)I-rhTIMP-1 showed a clear 28 kDa band 1.5 hours after (125)I-rhTIMP-1 administration in the cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the 28 kDa band decreased after 3.0 hours of the administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some (125)I-rhTIMP-1 maintained its molecular integrity for 8.5 hours in ischemic striatum after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: (125)I-labeled rhTIMP-1 was distributed quickly into ischemic brain tissue and had a slow elimination in both blood and brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results, along with other studies suggesting therapeutic benefits, will aid in the development of TIMP-1 for protecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
