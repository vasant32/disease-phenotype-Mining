<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Connexin 43 (Cx43) is one of the major gap junction proteins in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that, after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, heterozygote Cx43 null (Cx43+/-) mice exhibited larger infarction volumes than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (Cx43+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored the underlying mechanism by which gap junctional intercellular communication influences astrocytic activation and neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both Cx43+/- and Cx43+/+ mice underwent right side permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were prepared by transcardial perfusion, and at 24 hours and 4 days after surgery, brains were prepared for immunohistochemistry or Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four days after MCAO, Cx43+/- mice showed severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the penumbral lesion compared with Cx43+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of caspase-3 was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion of Cx43+/- mice than in Cx43+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four days after MCAO, Cx43+/- mice showed a significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume but a smaller area of <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> than did Cx43+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The penumbra of Cx43+/- mice showed an increased level of Cx30 compared with Cx43+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gap junctions may play an important role in astrocytic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reactive astrocytes may reduce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by regulating extracellular conditions through their gap junction </plain></SENT>
