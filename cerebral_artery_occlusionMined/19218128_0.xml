<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the reliability of quantitative neurological tests in evaluating the neurological deficits in rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty male SD rats (7 to 9 weeks old) were subjected to transient (1 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 9 received sham operation only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The motor and sensory functions of the rats were measured before and 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after MCAO by accelerating rotarod test and modified adhesive removal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days later, the rats were sacrificed for histological examination, and the lesion size was determined by Winroof image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits of the rats with different lesion sizes and at different time points were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, the rats after MCAO were divided into two subgroups with large lesions [(68.56+/-12.54)%] affecting both the cortical area and basal ganglia and small lesions [(12.45+/-9.06)%] affecting the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the results of modified adhesive removal test and rotarod test were found between the two groups, and a liner relationship was noted between the lesion size and the results of the neurological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The modified quantitative neurological tests can reliably evaluate the severity of the infarction and estimate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
