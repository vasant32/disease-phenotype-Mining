<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During their 7-9 day lifespan in the circulation platelets are mainly responsible for maintaining the integrity of the vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In thrombocytopenic states, there is an increase in vascular permeability and fragility, presumably due to absence of this platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, biochemical or physical injury in the coronary, carotid or peripheral arteries induces platelet activation and platelet recruitment, which can culminate in thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since there is one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> every 33 s from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> in the United States, this situation constitutes a major public health issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the course of studying interactions between cells of the vascular wall and those in the circulation, we observed that platelets in close proximity to endothelial cells do not respond to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments initiated in the late 1980's cumulatively indicated that endothelial cell CD39--an ecto-ADPase--was mainly responsible for this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD39 rapidly and preferentially metabolizes <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> released from activated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> is the final common pathway for platelet recruitment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and platelet aggregation and recruitment are abolished by CD39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our current hypothesis is that CD39 will be a novel antithrombotic agent for treating high risk patients who have activated platelets in their circulation--the identifying characteristic of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A recombinant, soluble form of human CD39 has been generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is solCD39, a glycosylated protein of 66 kDa whose enzymatic and biological properties are identical to the full-length form of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our in vitro experiments, solCD39 blocks <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced human platelet aggregation, and inhibits collagen- and thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-induced platelet reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We studied solCD39 in vitro in a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which was shown to be driven by excessive platelet recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In studies with CD39 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (CD39+/+) mice solCD39 completely abolished <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation, and strongly inhibited collagen- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi>-induced platelet reactivity ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When solCD39 was administered prior to transient intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, it reduced ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath>, decreased (111)In-platelet deposition, and increased post-ischemic blood flow 2-fold at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results were superior to those we obtained with aspirin pre-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CD39 null (CD39-/-) mice, which we generated by deletion of exons 4-6 (apyrase conserved regions 2-4), have a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematologic profiles and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, but exhibit a decrease in post-ischemic perfusion and an increase in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when compared to genotypic CD39+/+ controls in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model. "Reconstitution" of CD39 null mice with solCD39 reversed these pathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CD39-/- mice were actually rescued from cerebral injury by solCD39, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These experiments have led us to hypothesize that solCD39 has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize our recent research results with CD39 and solCD39, and discuss our viewpoints on its present and future possibilities as a novel treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
