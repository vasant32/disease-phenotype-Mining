<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intravenous infusion of rat adrenomedullin, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/kg/min, for 60 min increased the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a dose-dependent manner in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured using a laser Doppler flowmetry device placed on the surface of the parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increase in rCBF induced by 1.0 microgram/kg/min of adrenomedullin was up to 145 +/- 10.8% of controls at 60 min (n = 5, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These concentrations of adrenomedullin did not affect systemic blood pressure or other physiologic parameters, including pH, PaCO2, PaO2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated infusion of 1.0 microgram/kg/min of adrenomedullin at 2-h intervals caused tachyphylaxis (n = 5, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rat adrenomedullin (1.0 microgram/kg/min) demonstrated a more potent effect than the same dose of human adrenomedullin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal fragment of human adrenomedullin (0.5 and 5.0 micrograms/kg/min), adrenomedullin22-52, which did not affect rCBF alone, inhibited the effect of rat adrenomedullin (0.5 microgram/kg/min) as a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a model of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, pre- and postinfusion of 1.0 microgram/kg/min of adrenomedullin suppressed the reduction in rCBF following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (control, 29 +/- 15.1%; adrenomedullin group, 45 +/- 14.4%; not significant) and decreased the volume of ischemic brain injury (control, 288 +/- 35 mm3; adrenomedullin group, 232 +/- 35 mm3; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that adrenomedullin increases rCBF and prevents ischemic brain injury, partly by increasing the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
