<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to know the time course of changes in regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and whether focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may affect the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> in distant area of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods Fifty-five rats were subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) on the olfactory tract, under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals were sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were decapitated at 1/2, 1,2,3,6,12 and 24 hours post-occlusion (PO), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed, and the brain structures dissected out include bilateral corpus striatum, cerebral cortex (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory) and cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamines</z:chebi> were extracted by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="30187">alumina</z:chebi> procedure, and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) contents, in ipsilateral corpus striatum and cerebral cortex to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, decreased at 1 hour PO, and reached, at 6 hours PO, to 40% of control value in corpus striatum and 30% in cerebral cortex, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6 hours PO, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) content in the ipsilateral corpus striatum gradually reduced and reached to 60% of control value at 24 hours PO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NE in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex decreased to 50% of control at 1 hour PO, and thereafter remained reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral corpus striatum and cerebral cortex, either <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> or NE showed no significant changes, except 1/2 hour PO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar NE content, bilaterally, reduced slowly to 70% of control at 24 hours PO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
