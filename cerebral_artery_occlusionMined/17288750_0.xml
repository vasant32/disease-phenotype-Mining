<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe a stent placement in the treatment of a refractory artherothrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion beyond 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 57-year-old man presented with a progressive left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and verbal disturbance resulting from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> superimposed on severe proximal atheromatous stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the significant diffusion-perfusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After chemical and mechanical thrombolysis of the clot, balloon angioplasty of the underlying <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was performed 2 days post-attack, without significant angiographic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous endovascular deployment of a stent (Driver 2.5 x 12 mm, MTI, Irvine, CA) was subsequently performed, with excellent angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up diffusion-perfusion MRI showed improved perfusion in the hypoperfused area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was increased from 12 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clot thrombolysis and subsequent stenting in patients with refractory proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is feasible and allows for a significant reduction in the amount of thrombolytic drug required </plain></SENT>
