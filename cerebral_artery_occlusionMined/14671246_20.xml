<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency and relevance of incomplete recanalization for tissue and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database (Kompetenznetzwerk Schlaganfall B5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n=82) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion (excluding carotid T-occlusions) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had received a multiparametric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> MRI protocol including diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI, PWI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) within 6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, at day 1 and after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization status was determined with MRA on day 1 (according to Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> flow grades) and used to group patients into those with persistent occlusion (0) or minimal (1), partial (2), or complete (3) recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incomplete recanalization according to MRI criteria was found in 39 patients (grade 1: n=20; grade 2: n=19), complete recanalization in 10, and persistent occlusion in 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in any of the clinical (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score) or MRI baseline parameters (DWI lesion, PWI deficit, mismatch volume, mismatch ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, lesion growth was smaller in patients with recanalization (even in patients with only minimal recanalization) and outcome was related to the degree of recanalization (mean modified Rankin score at 90 days: 3.36, 2.70, 1.79, and 1.44 for the groups with no, minimal, partial, and complete recanalization, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both incomplete and complete recanalization was more frequent in patients receiving thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete recanalization on day 1 is a frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> finding after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion, indicating a more favorable clinical course than persistent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> indicators of early recanalization could be useful surrogates of efficacy in thrombolytic trials </plain></SENT>
