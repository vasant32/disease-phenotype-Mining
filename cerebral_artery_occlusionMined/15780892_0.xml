<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of brain sections can be measured from digitized immunohistology slides so that quantitative assessment can be carried out by computer-assisted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional methods of analyzing immunohistology are based on image classification techniques applied to a specific anatomic location at high magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such micro-scale localized image analysis limits one for further correlative studies with other imaging modalities on whole brain sections, which are of particular interest in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report presents a semi-automated image analysis method that performs convolution-based image classification on micro-scale images, extracts numerical data representing positive immunoreactivity from the processed micro-scale images and creates a corresponding quantitative macro-scale image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present method utilizes several image-processing techniques to cope with variances in intensity distribution, as well as artifacts caused by light scattering or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of antigen expression, which are commonly encountered in immunohistology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Micro-scale images are composed by a tiling function in a mosaic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image classification is accomplished by the K-means clustering method at the relatively low-magnification micro-scale level in order to increase computation efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quantitative macro-scale image is suitable for correlative analysis with other imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method was applied to different immunostaining antibodies, such as endothelial barrier antigen (EBA), lectin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), on histology slides from animals subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reliability tests show that the results obtained from immunostained images at high magnification and relatively low magnification are virtually the same </plain></SENT>
