<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, there is a close interrelationship between extravasation of serum proteins and retention of water in the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> both cytotoxic and vasogenic mechanisms are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A biphasic opening of the blood-brain barrier, associated with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, is observed following release of major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first opening of the barrier is related to a reactive hyperemia which follows promptly recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second opening, recognizable after a delay, is associated with a severe ischemic brain tissue injury </plain></SENT>
