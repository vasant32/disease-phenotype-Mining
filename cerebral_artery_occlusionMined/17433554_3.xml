<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> has received considerable attention as a potential therapeutic agent against various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental data in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have provided exhaustive evidence of the neuroprotective properties of this steroid hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory in particular has demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment in male rats significantly reduced (approximately 50%) ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 4 h following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in the protective actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in this experimental model have yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that in various in vivo and in vitro models, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> can be pro-apoptotic and that this effect may be mediated by an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced up-regulation of the Fas/FasL system and the subsequent activation of caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that under ischemic conditions following MCAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> would up-regulate protective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways leading to caspase-12 activation, thus limiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> significantly increased activated caspase-12 at 2, 3 and 4 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of brain sections showed a significantly higher number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end-labeling positive cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated animals at 4 h, but not at 2 h, post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings correlate with previous observations that differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated animals are not seen until 3 and 4 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease in m-calpain expression was observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region only at 4 h post-MCAO following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> pre-treatment, suggesting m-calpain may not be involved in regulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced caspase-12 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these cellular changes correlated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> pretreatment, we conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> may up-regulate ER-specific apoptotic pathways, thus limiting the extent of necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> which is responsible for the spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and growth of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following MCAO </plain></SENT>
