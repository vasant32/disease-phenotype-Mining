<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the therapeutic effects of neural progenitor cells (NPC) upon middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of rats with exploration of the differences between adult and embryonic NPCs in therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GFP-labeled adult or embryonic NPCs were transplanted for transient MCAO model of rats at 1h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were examined behaviorally using limb placement test, rotarod test and cylinder test with neuroradiological assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently after euthanasia, rats were immunohistochemically investigated to explore graft survival and immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI of rats receiving NPCs revealed significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, compared to vehicle-treated rats with corresponding behavioral amelioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transplanted cells were surviving in rats receiving NPCs, although the number of embryonic NPCs was significantly higher than that of adult NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iba-1-positive inflammatory cells of rats receiving adult NPCs were prominent, compared to those receiving embryonic NPCs, which might be a rationale for the differences between rats receiving adult and embryonic NPCs in the number of surviving NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contraries, adult NPCs surely demonstrated therapeutic effects with a few surviving cells, thus indicating that the therapeutic effects might be due to trophic/growth factor-secretion from transplanted NPCs, rather than replacement of damaged host neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effects of NPCs for MCAO model of rats were clarified in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of NPCs will be a hopeful strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, although further studies are required for the patient safety and underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
