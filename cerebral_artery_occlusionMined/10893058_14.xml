<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the predictive value of measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction ratio (OER) for assessment of the fate of ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequential PET measurements were performed during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; 2 h) and 12-24 h (mean 18 h) of reperfusion in a primate model (Macaca mulatta, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A penumbra region was delineated on the MCAO PET image (OER &gt; 125% and CMRO2&gt; or = 45% of the values observed in the contralateral hemisphere, respectively) and an infarction region was delineated on the last PET image (CMRO2 &lt;45% of the values observed in the contralateral hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The penumbra regions delineated during MCAO and the infarction regions delineated at the final PET, were copied on to the images from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other PET sessions for measurements of CBF, CMRO2 and OER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ratios were calculated by dividing the mean values obtained by the values of the corresponding contralateral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathology verified the adequacy of the criteria applied in the last PET for delineation of the infarction region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The penumbra region and infarction region were separated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, except in two cases where a minimal overlap was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF and OER showed considerable variation over time and there was no consistent difference between the penumbra and infarction regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CMRO2 showed a more stable pattern and the difference between penumbra and infarction regions was maintained from the time of MCAO throughout the entire reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With CMRO2 as predictor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 50 observations could be correctly predicted as penumbra or infarction when using an optimal threshold ratio value estimated to be in the interval of 61% to 69% of the corresponding contralateral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF and OER proved to have low power as predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CMRO2 is the best predictor of reversible or irreversible brain damage and the critical metabolic threshold level appears to be a reduction of oxygen metabolism to between 61% and 69% of the corresponding contralateral region </plain></SENT>
