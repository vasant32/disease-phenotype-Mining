<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by in situ hybridization in a well-established rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ischemic cortex CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were elevated 2.6-fold 60 min after MCAo, compared with sham operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also induced in the amygdala, 60 min following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in a pattern which was qualitatively different from that of sham operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This rapid and profound increase in CRH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is likely to be associated with neurotoxicity, as CRH antagonism has been reported to cause a significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
