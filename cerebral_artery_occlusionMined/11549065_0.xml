<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-secreting cell line by genetic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enveloped these cells into polymer capsules, which consist of a semipermeable membrane, and implanted them into the right striatum of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 6 days after implantation, these rats received right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using interluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found approximately 30% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the encapsulated bFGF-secreting cell grafting groups vs. the encapsulated naive BHK cell grafting group or the without implantation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured bFGF secretion from encapsulated bFGF-secreting cells using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The retrieved capsules continued to secrete bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of bFGF secretion between the capsules before and after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large number of viable BHK-bFGF cells was observed within the full length of the retrieved capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that encapsulated bFGF-secreting cell grafting exerts a protective effect on ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
