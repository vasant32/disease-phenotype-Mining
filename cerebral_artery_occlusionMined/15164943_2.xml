<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and analyse the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> responses to brain injury in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model after increased oral iron intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in a group of 20 male Wistar rats, 10 of which were fed with a control diet and 10 of which were fed with iron-enriched diet containing 2.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> iron for 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolites were determined in blood samples before and at 2, 6, 8 and 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was 66% greater in the iron-fed rats than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Iron-fed animals showed significantly higher levels of TBARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver iron stores (3500 +/- 199 vs 352 +/- 28 microg Fe/g, p&lt;0.0001) but not brain iron stores (131 +/- 11 vs 139 +/- 8 microg Fe/g, p=0.617), were significantly higher in the iron-fed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> levels were slightly lower in iron-fed rats and decreased significantly in both groups at 6 and 8 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of the stable end products of NOS (NOx = <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> + nitrate) were significantly higher in iron-fed rats before MCAO (16.2 +/- 2.2 vs. 9.6 +/- 0.8 micromol x L(-1), p&lt;0.05), with a further increase during the six first hours after MCAO in both groups </plain></SENT>
