<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that in vivo human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCB) migrate toward brain injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha may participate in the recruitment of HUCB towards the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and 24 hours later the production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha in the brain was examined with immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chemotactic effect of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha, and the expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 receptor CCR2 and MIP-1alpha receptor CCR1, CCR5 on the surface of HUCB were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-1alpha expression were significantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere of brain, and significantly promoted HUCB cell migration compared to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cell migration was neutralized with polyclonal antibodies against <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 or MIP-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also chemokine receptors were constitutively expressed on the surface of HUCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggested that the increased chemokines in the ischemic area can bind cell surface receptors on HUCB, and induce cell infiltration of systemically delivered HUCB cells into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
