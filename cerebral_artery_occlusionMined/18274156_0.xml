<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to one hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 48 hours of reperfusion with the pretreatment of drugs (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> 15, 30, 60 mg/ kg or nimodipine 0.4 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavioral tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was assessed in the brain slices stained with 2% solution of 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathologic histological changes were observed by H&amp;E staining and the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> at doses of 15, 30, 60 mg/kg exhibited significant neuroprotective effects on rats against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury by markedly decreasing neurological deficit scores and the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48293">HEP</z:chebi> might provide neuroprotection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury probably through its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory property </plain></SENT>
