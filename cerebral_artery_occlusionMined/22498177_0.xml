<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses were performed at 2, 7, 14 and 28 d after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fission protein fission 1 (Fis1) and phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (P-Drp1) both progressively increased with the peak at 14 d after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescent analysis showed the number of double positive cells with Fis1/Drp1 reduced between 2 and 28 d after 90 min of tMCAO, and also showed some double positive cells with Fis1/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) in the peri-infract regions at 2d after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests a progressive activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fission proteins Fis1 and P-Drp1 in relation to apoptotic process in neural cells of the peri-infract regions after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
