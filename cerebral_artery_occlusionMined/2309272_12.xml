<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded with a snare ligature for 1, 2, or 6 hours followed by 5, 4, or 0 hours of reflow, respectively (seven rats in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were injected with neutral red for visual confirmation that the affected regions were reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were frozen in situ, and the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>, phosphocreatine, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were determined in those areas corresponding to the normally perfused medial ipsilateral cortex, the perifocal region, and the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values for the 6 hours' occlusion with no reflow group served as a control to demonstrate restoration of metabolite concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups with reflow, the levels of high-energy phosphates were greater than control, but this effect of reflow was primarily significant for the group with 1 hour's occlusion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> provided additional evidence that the extent of metabolite restoration was graded; following 2 hours of occlusion, metabolite recovery was compromised (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly support the concept that the window of opportunity for effective treatment of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by reperfusion is narrow (of short duration) </plain></SENT>
