<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, caused by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult rats, leads to a marked increase of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-generated new neurons, as well as neuroblasts probably already formed before the insult, migrate into the severely damaged area of the striatum, where they express markers of developing and mature, striatal medium-sized spiny neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induces differentiation of new neurons into the phenotype of most of the neurons destroyed by the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the adult brain has the capacity for self-repair after insults causing extensive neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the new neurons are functional and their formation can be stimulated, a novel therapeutic strategy might be developed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
