<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effect on axonal plasticity and neurological recovery in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using behavioral tests combined with anterograde tract tracing studies and with immunohistochemical and molecular biological experiments, we examined effects of a delayed i.c.v. delivery of recombinant human VEGF(165), starting 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, on functional neurological recovery, corticorubral plasticity and inflammatory brain responses in mice submitted to 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We herein show that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> functional improvements of motor grip strength and coordination, which are induced by VEGF, are accompanied by enhanced sprouting of contralesional corticorubral fibres that branched off the pyramidal tract in order to cross the midline and innervate the ipsilesional parvocellular red nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltrates of CD45+ leukocytes were noticed in the ischemic striatum of vehicle-treated mice that closely corresponded to areas exhibiting Iba-1+ activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF attenuated the CD45+ leukocyte infiltrates at 14 but not 30 days post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and diminished the microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, the VEGF-induced anti-inflammatory effect of VEGF was associated with a downregulation of a broad set of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a link between VEGF's immunosuppressive and plasticity-promoting actions that may be important for successful brain remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, growth factors with anti-inflammatory action may be promising therapeutics in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
