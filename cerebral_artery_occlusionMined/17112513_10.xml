<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that slow and controlled rewarming after moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is superior to fast rewarming in rats subjected to 90 min temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two experiments were designed: (i) 34 rats were randomly assigned to either normothermic treatment, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) with rapid rewarming within 20 min, or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with slow rewarming within 2 h after 4 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> starting 2 h after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size, neuroscore, myeloperoxidase and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) positive cells were assessed on day 5 after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(ii) In 15 rats, striatal cerebral microdialysis was performed from 1.5 h before until 8 h after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was largest in the normothermic group (89.9+/-16.8 mm(3)) followed by the fast rewarming group (69.2+/-12.6 mm(3)), and a significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the slow rewarming group (41.1+/-6.6 mm(3), p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological functions improved in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> groups at day 5 after tMCAO (Neuroscore median 2.5 in normothermia vs. 1.5 in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> groups) though without any difference between slowly and fast rewarmed animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periinfarct expression of AQP4 was less prominent in slowly rewarmed animals as was the count of MPO-positive cells in subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> release was significantly higher at 4 distinct time points in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Slow rewarming after a period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is superior to fast rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may blunt deleterious rebound effects such as overexpression of AQP4, sustain anti-inflammatory mechanisms and thereby preserve the neuroprotection delivered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
