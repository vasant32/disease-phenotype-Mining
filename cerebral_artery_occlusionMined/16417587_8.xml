<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of interaction between nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and caveolin in the brain, however, remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the role(s) of NO in regulating caveolin-1 expression in rat ischemic brains with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure to 1 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced the increases in neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) and NO concentration with concurrent down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in the ischemic core of rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent 24 h or more reperfusion time led to an increase in inducible NOS (iNOS) expression and NO production, as well as a decline of caveolin-1 protein at the core and penumbra of the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, NOS inhibitors and an NO donor were utilized to clarify the link between NO production and caveolin-1 expression in the rats with 1 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plus 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">Nitroso</z:chebi>-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, a NO donor) down-regulated the expression of caveolin-1 protein in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results, when taken together, suggest that NO modulates the expression of caveolin-1 in the brain and that the loss of caveolin-1 is associated with NO production in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
