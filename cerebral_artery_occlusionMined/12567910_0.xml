<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between the neuroprotective effect of alpha-dihydroergocryptine (alpha-DHEC) and the activation of nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-Kappa B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA binding activity of NF-Kappa B was determined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in animals subjected to varying durations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroapoptosis induced by ischemic damage was measured by deoxynucleotidy transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No change was observed in nuclear NF-Kappa B DNA binding in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A low level of constitutive NF-Kappa B DNA binding was detected in animals subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of 1 h, and significant increase in the amount of active NF-Kappa B in nuclear extracts was observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak of NF-Kappa B DNA binding was observed at the time point of 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of 3 h potentially initiates neuroapoptosis and activates NF-Kappa B in nuclear extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alpha-DHEC (100 micrograms.kg-1 and 150 micrograms.kg-1) showed significant protective effect on neuroapoptosis-induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of 3 h, and inhibiting NF-Kappa B activation using 100 mg.kg-1 pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) in the continuous presence of alpha-DHEC, the neuroprotective effect of alpha-DHEC was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the neuroprotetive effect of alpha-DHEC may depend on the activation of NF-Kappa B </plain></SENT>
