<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, combined diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with perfusion imaging (PI) has become an important investigational tool in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, as it may differentiate reversible from irreversible brain tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We consecutively examined 20 subjects within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> using a multiparametric magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) examination consisting of DWI, mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) as PI parameter, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) on day 7 were also acquired in order to obtain final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> parameters were considered: volumetric measures of lesion growth and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> abnormalities, quantification of regional apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and visual inspection of MRA findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed: (1) an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesion was not predictive of lesion growth and the DWI abnormality did not represent the irreversibly infarcted tissue; (2) <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the ischemic penumbra could not predict tissue at risk; (3) the DWI-PI mismatch did not predict lesion growth, and the PI abnormality overestimated the amount of tissue at risk; and (4) patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had greater initial and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study did not demonstrate the prognostic value of a multimodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> approach in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; MRA alone provided predictive information about the volumetric evolution of the lesion </plain></SENT>
