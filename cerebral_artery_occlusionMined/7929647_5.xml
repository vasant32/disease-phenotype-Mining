<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical preparation of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> models may alter leukocyte reactivity and thereby make interpretation of leukocyte function following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of surgical preparation and of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion on granulocyte function have been examined prospectively in a baboon model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six adolescent male baboons underwent surgical preparation, of which 21 underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four additional animals served as nonsurgical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral venous blood specimens were taken for performing assays of leukocyte function at defined intervals before and after both the surgical preparation (i.e., the overall procedure for implantation of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> device) and occlusion/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A stress-related elevation in total leukocyte number was attributed mainly to an increase in the number of circulating PMN leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Values rose from 13.9 +/- 4.9 x 10(3) to 27.8 +/- 5.8 x 10(3)/microliters, (+/- SD; n = 21) for total leukocyte number, with p &lt; 0.001, and from 4.3 +/- 2.1 x 10(3) to 15.9 +/- 4.7 x 10(3)/microliters (n = 21) for PMN leukocytes, with p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical preparation had no effect (p &gt; or = 0.4) on the ability of PMN leukocytes, isolated 24 h after the implantation procedure, to display polarization, O2.- production, or beta-glucuronidase release when stimulated with human C5a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A moderate decrease in the chemotactic response to C5a resolved within the 7-day postsurgery (preocclusion) period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 1-h reperfusion resulted in a significant reduction in C5a-induced polarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
