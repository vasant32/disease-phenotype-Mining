<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the differences of the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> between young and old rat brains, distributions of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and tau proteins were analyzed after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in young (10-11 weeks) and old (15 months) rats by immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 4 h of reperfusion, strong cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity for GSK3beta was induced in neurons of lamina I, II, V and VI of the cerebral cortex and dorsal caudate in young brains, while the induction was not observed in lamina I and II of old cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The staining in lamina V and VI and dorsal caudate then gradually decreased until seven days of reperfusion in both animal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining of tau protein and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) did not show any positive signals in the control brain, but showed positive signals after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with a peak at 24 h and 3 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the temporal and spatial patterns of tau and TUNEL stainings between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GSK3beta may have a role in ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and that the different spatial expression of GSK3beta between young and old rat brains may partly explain the vulnerability of older neurons after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
