<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tbeta4 improves cardiac function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in adult mice and promotes healing properties in both dermal and corneal wounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that Tbeta4 improves functional neurological outcome in a rat model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Male Wistar rats (n=18) were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tbeta4 (6 mg/kg, IP) was administered 24 h after MCAo and then every 3 days for four additional doses (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with saline were used as a control (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adhesive-removal test (ART) and modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) were performed to measure functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 56 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was performed with antibodies against NG-2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi>), CNPase (2", 3"-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> 3'-phosphodiesterase) to detect immature and mature oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurofilament-H (NF-H) antibodies were used to detect axons while myelinated axons were identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e>/Luxol (B/L) Blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EBA (endothelial barrier antigen) was used for detection of mature vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic rats treated with Tbeta4 demonstrated a significant overall improvement (P&lt;0.01) in the ART and the mNSS when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was observed beginning at 14 and 35 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes showed no significant differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Tbeta4 increased myelinated axons and increased vessel density in the ischemic boundary (P&lt;0.05) and augmented remyelination which was associated with an increase of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and myelinating oligodendrocytes (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that Tbeta4 improves neurological functional outcome after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Axonal remodeling from mobilization of OPCs is proposed as contributing to Tbeta4 induced functional improvement </plain></SENT>
