<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that concurrent administration of tirilazad, a well-known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of calcium and excitatory amino acids, would result in a synergistic neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and assigned to one of four treatment arms (n = 10 in each): 1) vehicle, 2) tirilazad, 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi>, or 4) tirilazad and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was recorded using laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were quantified by performing daily neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in cortical blood flow among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals that received tirilazad or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> monotherapy had significantly better neurological function compared with control animals only on postoperative Days 3 and 4, whereas animals treated with both drugs had significantly better neurological function than did control animals from postoperative Days 2 through 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 25% (nonsignificant), tirilazad by 48% (P&lt;0.05), and combination therapy by 59% (P&lt;0.05) compared with control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of excitatory amino acids and free radicals provides better neuroprotection from the effects of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than does therapy with either <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to many experimental agents, tirilazad and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> offer the advantage of being licensed for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This drug combination could be of great benefit when administered before temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in patients undergoing cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
