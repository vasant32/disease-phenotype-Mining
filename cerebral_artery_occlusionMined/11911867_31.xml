<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The local activation of resident cells and efficient recruitment of leukocytes into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system are critical steps in this inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe studies using flow cytometry to examine the temporal pattern of inflammatory cell activation and infiltration following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an increase in activated microglia/macrophages as early as 18 h post occlusion, which peaked at 48 h and remained abundant at 96 h post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were significantly increased by 48 h and remained elevated at 96 h post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes were increased relatively late (72 and 96 h) post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometry data correlate well both quantitatively and qualitatively with immunohistochemistry analysis performed on the same mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates the power of flow cytometry in analyzing the inflammatory process following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and offers temporal information on the cellular changes in mice following transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
