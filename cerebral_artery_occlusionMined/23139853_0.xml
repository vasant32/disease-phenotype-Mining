<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the clinical effect of systemic thrombolysis with an intravenous bolus of 20 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and an infusion of body-weight adjusted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> for 48 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective, open label study, included 192 patients (68Â±13 years, 50% males) treated between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was assessed with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed using a telephone interview of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The site of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was determined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of the patients had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory and were severely affected with a median NIHSS of 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During treatment on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit the patients improved (P&lt;0.0001) except for patients who deceased due to malignant infarction (n=10) or cerebral haemorrhage (n=6); 18 percent deceased within 100 days which was predicted by older age (76 + 10 years, P&lt;0.05) and more severe affection on admission (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, these patients more frequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.03) than the surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The surviving patients had more frequently distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions and improved further (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At follow-up 48% of the patients had a mRS of 0 and 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly to intravenous thrombolysis with body-weight adjusted rtPA, poor prognosis was predicted by higher age, more severe neurological deficit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admission, and a proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Half of the surviving patients improved to no or minimal impairment </plain></SENT>
