<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: AM-36 is a novel arylalkylpiperazine with combined <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel blocking actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individually, these properties have been shown to confer neuroprotection in a variety of in vitro and in vivo animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies have shown that AM-36 is neuroprotective in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess the neuroprotective and behavioral outcome after delayed administration of AM-36 in an endothelin-1-induced, middle cerebral artery model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conscious male hooded Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by perivascular microinjection of endothelin-1 via a previously implanted cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AM-36 (6 mg/kg IP) or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally 30, 60, or 180 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was determined 24, 48, and 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by neurological deficit score, motor performance, and sensory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 72 hours, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and volume were determined by histology and computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in marked functional deficits and neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AM-36 significantly reduced cortical damage when administration was delayed until 30, 60, or 180 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, neuronal damage was time-dependently reduced, with the greatest protection found when AM-36 was administered 180 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Striatal damage was significantly reduced after treatment with AM-36 at 180 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome paralleled histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rota-rod performance, sensory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e>, and neurological deficit scores returned to preischemia levels in AM-36-treated rats by 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when administration was delayed by 180 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AM-36 potently protects against both neuronal damage and functional deficits even when administered up to 180 minutes after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In fact, the greatest protection was found when administration was delayed by 180 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of action of AM-36 are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that AM-36 may have great promise in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
