<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the 7th day, the middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded ipsilateral to the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was visualized by means of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> histochemistry and quantified in four different standardized coronal plains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the effects of fetal tissue grafting and those of transplantation were identified by using glial fibrillary acidic protein and nerve growth factor immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The grafts integrated well into their new environment and significantly reduced the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in middle cerebral artery-occluded animals compared with both sham-operated and control rats 24 h postoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon might be an increased neurotrophic, particularly nerve growth factor, release by the grafted fetal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reactive astroglial cells may also trigger the neuroprotection by additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced nerve growth factor release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present data demonstrate the potential neurotrophin-mediated protective effects of fetal brain tissue implanted into the adult rat brain before unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the beneficial effects of astrocyte activation </plain></SENT>
