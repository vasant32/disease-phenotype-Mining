<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Animals subjected to an inflammatory insult at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are predisposed to the development of an inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This response is associated with worse neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because induction of immunologic tolerance to brain antigens before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is associated with improved outcome, we sought to determine whether this paradigm could prevent the deleterious <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to brain provoked by an inflammatory stimulus at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats were tolerized to myelin basic protein (MBP) or ovalbumin by intranasal administration before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were performed at set time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One month after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, lymphocytes from the spleens of MBP-tolerized animals were less likely to evidence an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> and more likely to evidence a regulatory response (Treg) toward MBP than those from ovalbumin-tolerized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals that had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> toward MBP (a Th1 response) performed worse on behavioral tests than those that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fractalkine, a surrogate marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, was elevated in animals with a Th1 response to MBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data extend our previous findings and suggest that deleterious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> to brain antigens can be prevented by prophylactically inducing regulatory T-cell responses to those antigens </plain></SENT>
