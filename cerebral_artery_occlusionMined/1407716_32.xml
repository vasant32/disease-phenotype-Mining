<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the contribution of interleukin 1 (IL-1) on ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation, the effect of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta (rhIL-1 beta), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28783">zinc protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (ZnPP) as an IL-1 blocker, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was studied in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were subjected to 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion, rhIL-1 beta at a dose of 10 ng/2 microliters, or ZnPP at doses of 1 and 10 micrograms/2 microliters were topically applied into lateral cerebroventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rhIL-1 beta-treated rats, ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation was significantly increased in the dorsal and ventral areas of the caudate putamen 24 h after reperfusion, compared to that of vehicle-treated control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in ZnPP-treated rats, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was decreased in both caudate-putamen areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that IL-1 plays an important role in pathogenesis for post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
