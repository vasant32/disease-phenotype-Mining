<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have indicated that neutrophils play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils are also known to adhere to the endothelial wall through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and to infiltrate into the tissue, and this neutrophilic invasion correlates with the concentration gradient of chemotactic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) on brain damage in rats from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The brain water content was measured to evaluate postischemic brain injury in rats with 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate the blood and brain concentrations of CINC, and enzymatic and histological techniques were used to measure the neutrophilic infiltration into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increase of water content was first observed at 6 hours after reperfusion, after which this increase was gradual, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> peaking from 24 to 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophilic infiltration into the parenchyma and myeloperoxidase activity were first noted 12 hours after reperfusion, after which a marked increase occurred from 24 to 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic brain areas, CINC was first detected at 3 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CINC level peaked at 12 hours after reperfusion (9.15 +/- 0.45 ng/g wet wt, n = 5 and then gradually reduced from 24 to 48 hours after reperfusion (5.35 +/- 0.95 ng/g wet wt, n = 5, and 1.25 +/- 0.10 ng/g wet wt, n = 5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the serum CINC concentration was transiently elevated from 3 to 6 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No CINC production was detected in the brain of rats subjected to 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A marked increase in CINC concentration was detected in brain and serum during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the time course of CINC production precedes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and neutrophilic infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that CINC may play an important role in neutrophilic infiltration in ischemic lesion and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
