<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the dose-response characteristics and the therapeutic time window of SM-31900 in this MCAo model, we conducted three experiments, in which the administration of SM-31900 was started 5min (experiment I), 30min (experiment II), or 60min (experiment III) after MCAo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies, SM-31900 was administered by intravenous bolus injection followed by continuous intravenous infusion to obtain a steady-state level of this compound in blood immediately after its administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment with SM-31900 was continued until 24h after MCAo, at which time the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In experiment I, SM-31900 significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 37% at a dosage of 0.38mg/kg bolus followed by 1.5mg/kg/h continuous infusion (0.38mg/kg+1.5mg/kg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment II, the neuroprotective effect of SM-31900 was also significant, with a 25% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at a dosage of 0.38mg/kg+1.5mg/kg/h, and a 40% reduction at 1.5mg/kg+6.0mg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even in experiment III, SM-31900 exerted a significant neuroprotective effect, with a 20% reduction at 1.5mg/kg+6.0mg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed that SM-31900 can exert a neuroprotective effect when it is administered up to at least 60min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the MCAo model, an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, indicating that SM-31900 is a good candidate for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
