<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies from our laboratory showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> reduces ischemic brain damage by inhibiting inflammatory reaction and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we first explored the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> on the neuronal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, then further investigated its potential mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">Baicalin</z:chebi> was administrated by intraperitoneally injected twice at 2 and 12 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability were measured 24 h following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of MMP-9 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were determined by western blot and RT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of tight junction protein (TJP) occludin was detected by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability were significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> administration following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of MMP-9 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were significantly down-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, MCAO caused the decreased expression of occludin, which was significantly up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> reduces MCAO-induced neuronal damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, which might be associated with the inhibition of MMP-9 expression and MMP-9-mediated occludin degradation </plain></SENT>
