<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate whether SMND-309 has a protective effect on brain injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and if it did so, to investigate its effects on brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male SD rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by bipolar electro-coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests and brain patho-physiological tests were used to evaluate the damage to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Origin targets including mitochondria production of reactive oxygen species, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> potentia, membrane potential, energy metabolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory enzymes activities and mitochondria swelling degree were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SMND-309 decreased neurological deficit scores, reduced the number of dead hippocampal neuronal cells in accordance with its <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on mitochondria swelling degree, reactive oxygen species production, improvements on mitochondria swelling, energy metabolism, membrane potential level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain complex activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these findings indicate that SMND-309 exerted potent neuroprotective effects in the model of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, contributed to its protections on brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> structure and function </plain></SENT>
