<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into pseudo-operation group, model group, GV26-GV20 group, and BL18-BL23 group, with 15 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2/30 Hz,2 mA) was applied to GV26, GV20, BL18 and BL23 for 30 min every time and for 6 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroethologic scores of the rats were evaluated, plasma and cerebral endothelin (ET) and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) contents were determined by radioimmunorassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) After MCAO for 72 hours, the rats' neuroethologic score, plasma and cerebral ET contents in model group increased significantly in comparison with those of pseudo-operation group (P&lt;0.05, 0.01), and plasma and cerebral CGRP levels decreased considerably (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with model group, the neuroethologic scores, cerebral ET contents of GV26-GV20 and BL18-BL23 groups decreased significantly after CI (P&lt;0.01); and plasma and cerebral CGRP levels in two EA groups increased significantly (P&lt;0.05, 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between two EA groups in these 3 indexes (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of GV26-GV20 and BL18-BL23 can improve CI rats' behavior activity, which may be related to its effects in lowering cerebral ET and raising blood and cerebral CGRP levels </plain></SENT>
