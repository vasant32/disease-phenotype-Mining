<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) ATP and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> act as transmitters and neuromodulators on their own receptors but it is still unknown which part of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> derives per se from cells and which part is formed from the hydrolysis of released ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP from the rat striatum were estimated by the microdialysis technique under in vivo physiological conditions and after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by medial cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under physiological conditions, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and ATP concentrations were in the range of 130 nmol/L and 40 nmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of the novel ecto-ATPase inhibitor, PV4 (100 nmol/L), the extracellular concentration of ATP increased 12-fold to ~360 nmol/L but the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> concentration was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that, under physiological conditions, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> is not a product of extracellular ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first 4h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> increased to ~690 nmol/L and ATP to ~50 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of PV4 the extracellular concentration of ATP was in the range of 450 nmol/L and a significant decrease in extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (to ~270 nmol/L) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contribution of extracellular ATP to extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was maximal in the first 20 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we demonstrated, by immunoelectron microscopy, the presence of the concentrative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> transporter CNT2 on plasma and vesicle membranes isolated from the rat striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are in favor that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> is transported in vesicles and is released in an excitation-secretion manner under in vivo physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, extracellular ATP is hydrolyzed by ecto-nucleotidases which significantly contribute to the increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To establish the contribution of extracellular ATP to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> might constitute the basis for devising a correct putative purinergic strategy aimed at protection from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
