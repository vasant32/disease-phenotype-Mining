<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the effect of intranasal (IN) NGF on striatal neurogenesis and functional recovery in adult rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h, and then reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NGF or vehicle was intranasally administered 24 h after cerebral reperfusion, and the treatments continued for 6 consecutive days there after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were injected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) twice daily for 5-7 days after MCAO, and sacrificed 1 day and 28 days, respectively, after the last BrdU injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neural cell proliferation and survival in different brain regions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional tests and immunohistochemical staining were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that treatment with IN NGF failed to increase cell proliferation but improved survival of newly generated cells in ipsilateral striatum and subventricular zones (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence with BrdU and neuronal nuclei protein, a mature neuronal marker, were increased in striatum and SVZ in rats treated with IN NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery was also observed at time of neurogenesis enhancement in striate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IN NGF may enhance neurogenesis and survival of newly generated cells, which may result in improved functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
