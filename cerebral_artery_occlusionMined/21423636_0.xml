<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of DS in cerebrovascular disease has not been examined experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of DS on focal ischemic brain were investigated in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DS stimulated nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DS (10-300 μg/mL) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in mouse aorta, which was significantly attenuated by the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, suggesting that DS causes vasodilation via a NO-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DS increased resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), although it caused mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of DS on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral injury, C57/BL6J mice received 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 22.5 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DS administered 3 days before <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> significantly reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 53.7% compared with vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, DS did not reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in mice treated with the relatively specific endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor, N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15729">L-ornithine</z:chebi>, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of DS is primarily endothelium-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This correlated with increased phosphorylation of eNOS in the brains of DS-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DS acutely improves CBF in eNOS-dependent vasodilation and reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide causal evidence that DS is cerebroprotective via the eNOS-dependent production of NO, which ameliorates blood circulation </plain></SENT>
