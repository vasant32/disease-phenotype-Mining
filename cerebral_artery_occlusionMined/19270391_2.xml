<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the protein profile in the rat pituitary, adrenal gland, and splenic lymphocyte using proteomics techniques, and to elucidate potential changes in the immune neuroendocrine system following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of the 41 differentially expressed protein spots identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS-TOF), 13 proteins were closely related to the immune and/or the neuroendocrine system, and the other proteins might have different functions through other mechanisms in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that (i) the immune neuroendocrine system was obviously changed, and the changes might be important pathological mechanisms in brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and (ii) ischemic brain damage is co-regulated by several mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results might lay the foundations for further research on pathological mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
