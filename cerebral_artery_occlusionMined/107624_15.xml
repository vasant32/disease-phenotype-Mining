<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen additional animals served as unclipped controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cortical cerebral blood flow (rCBF), arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2), and regional cortical metabolic rate of O2 (rCMRO2) were measured hourly until sacrifie 11 hours postocclusion, at which time ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8 animals no treatment followed the occlusion, and these developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 animals pentobarbial 14 mg/kg was administered intravenously 30 min after occlusion and 7 mg/kg every 2 hours thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to 25.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C was started 30 min after occlusion and maintained until sacrifice; ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was not significantly altered from untreated-clipped animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> produced similar changes in rCBF, AVDO2, and rCMRO2, but only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, it is postulated that the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> in preventing ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> is not entirely related to their known effect on blood flow and metabolism </plain></SENT>
