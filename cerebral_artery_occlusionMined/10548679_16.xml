<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> would protect cortex from early deterioration of ion homeostasis and loss of excitability associated with reperfusion after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cortical extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> activity ([K+]o) and the response of [K+]o to direct cortical stimulation was measured both in the ischemic core and in the ischemic penumbra of normothermic and mildly hypothermic (31.5 degrees C to 32 degrees C) rats after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response of [K+]o during MCAO was similar in normothermic and hypothermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, within 1 hour of reperfusion, [K+]o in the ischemic core region of normothermic animals showed incomplete recovery and was refractory to direct cortical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[K+]o in hypothermic animals returned to preischemic levels on reperfusion and continued to respond to direct cortical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> prevented extensive infarction 24 hours after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is accompanied by early disturbances of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> homeostasis during reperfusion, which are accompanied by loss of excitability and which may contribute ultimately to cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
