<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activities of mouse and human activated protein C (APC) were compared using mouse and human plasma and the neuroprotective properties of murine APC were studied in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both human APC and mouse APC prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time in a dose-dependent manner, but mouse APC was sixfold more effective than human APC as an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in mouse plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human protein S enhanced prolongation of the APTT clotting time of human plasma by human APC, but not by mouse APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hydrolysis of the S-2366 chromogenic substrate by murine APC was essentially identical to human APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse plasma contains 75 nM protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model based on middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, murine APC was highly neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that recombinant murine APC is functionally similar to human APC both in vitro and in vivo and that it displays significant species specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results imply that murine APC is notably superior to human APC for studies of murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease models</z:e>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
