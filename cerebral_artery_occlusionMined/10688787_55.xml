<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccine generated autoantibodies that targeted a specific brain protein, the NR1 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After peroral administration of the AAV vaccine, transgene expression persisted for at least 5 months and was associated with a robust humoral response in the absence of a significant cell-mediated response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This single-dose vaccine was associated with strong anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> and neuroprotective activity in rats for both a kainate-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> model and also a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model at 1 to 5 months following vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, a vaccination strategy targeting brain proteins is feasible and may have therapeutic potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
