<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent data have shown that TLR4 performs a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury which serves as the origin of the immunological inflammatory reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic effects of pharmacological inhibitions of TLR4 and its immediate down-stream pathway remain to be uncovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, on mice, intracerebroventricular injection of resatorvid (TLR4 signal inhibitor; 0.01 Î¼g) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological score after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of phospho-p38, nuclear factor-kappa B, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expressions were significantly suppressed in the resatorvid-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, NOX4 associates with TLR4 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion seen in mice and human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of TLR4 each reduced NOX4 expression, leading to suppression of oxidative/nitrative stress and of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that resatorvid has potential as a therapeutic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> since it inhibits TLR4-NOX4 signaling which may be the predominant causal pathway </plain></SENT>
