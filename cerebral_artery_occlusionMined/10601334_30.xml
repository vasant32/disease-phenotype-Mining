<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Application of differential display to cultured rat astrocytes subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> allowed cloning of a novel cDNA, termed stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of SERP1 was enhanced in vitro by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and/or reoxygenation or other forms of stress, causing accumulation of unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and in vivo by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SERP1 cDNA encodes a 66-amino acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> which was found to be identical to ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) and bearing 29% identity to yeast suppressor of SecY 6 protein (YSY6p), suggesting participation in pathways controlling membrane protein biogenesis at ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cultured 293 cells subjected to ER stress, overexpression of SERP1/RAMP4 suppressed aggregation and/or degradation of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins, and subsequently, facilitated their glycosylation when the stress was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SERP1/RAMP4 interacted with Sec61alpha and Sec61beta, which are subunits of translocon, and a molecular chaperon calnexin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Sec61alpha and Sec61beta, but not SERP1/RAMP4, were found to associate with newly synthesized integral membrane proteins under stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that stabilization of membrane proteins in response to stress involves the concerted action of a rescue unit in the ER membrane comprised of SERP1/RAMP4, other components of translocon, and molecular chaperons in ER </plain></SENT>
