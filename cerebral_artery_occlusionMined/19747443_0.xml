<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Naomaitong, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, combined with mobilization of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and to explore the possible mechanism by detecting the expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and two SD rats were divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) group, Naomaitong group and Naomaitong plus rG-CSF group (combination group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using a nylon thread with some modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in the rG-CSF group and the untreated group were administered with rG-CSF 10 microg/(kg x d) by subcutaneous injection 3 d before and 2 d after the operation respectively, once a day, and rats in the Naomaitong group and the combination group were intragastrically administered Naomaitong before and after the operation until sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two, three, seven and fourteen days after operation, count of CD34-positive cells in peripheral blood and CD34 expression in brain tissue were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General neural function score (GNFS) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 in rat's brain were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Count of CD34-positive cells in peripheral blood and CD34 expression in brain tissue were high in the untreated group, and reached the peak at 3 d and 7 d respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34 expression in brain tissue was increased in each treated group, especially in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GNFS was increased at 3 d and 7 d in the untreated group, 7 d and 14 d in the rG-CSF group and the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 were increased 2, 3 and 7 d after operation, while expression of FasL at 2 d in the rG-CSF group, expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 in the combination group were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 at 7 d and 14 d in the combination group were lower than those in the rG-CSF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, expressions of Fas, FasL and caspase-3 were decreased in each group at 14 d as compared with those at 3 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There exists interaction between Naomaitong and BMSC mobilization in the effect of improving nerve function and inhibiting neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is implied that Naomaitong combined with BMSC mobilization down-regulates the expressions of Fas and FasL in early phase and then inhibits the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cascade reaction caused by caspase-3, which causes further inhibition of Fas and FasL expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
