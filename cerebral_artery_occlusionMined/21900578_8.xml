<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of resident brain macrophages-microglial cells-in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether microglial cells exert injurious effects after neonatal focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we selectively depleted these cells with intracerebral injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate before transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in postnatal day 7 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons by activated microglia was poor in animals with unmanipulated microglia, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of these cells did not increase the number of apoptotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lack of microglia increased the brain levels of several cytokines and chemokines already elevated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, and also increased the severity and volume of injury, suggesting that microglial cells contribute to endogenous protection during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> injury phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, to determine whether accumulation of reactive oxygen species in microglia adversely affects phagocytosis of dying neurons and contributes to injury, we delivered reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) into microglia, again using liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, pharmacologically increased intracellular GSH concentrations in microglia induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> accumulation in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts in these cells, further increased the brain levels of macrophage chemoattractants, and exacerbated injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these data show that microglia are part of the endogenous defense mechanisms and that, while <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> can protect the injured neonatal brain, high levels of reducing equivalents in activated microglia, GSH, trigger <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, favor the reorganization of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, amplify local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and exacerbate injury </plain></SENT>
