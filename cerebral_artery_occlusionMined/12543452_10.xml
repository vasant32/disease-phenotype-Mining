<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p-Akt single positive cells (E-/A+) were found in the sham control brains with weak signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of both survival signals concurrently increased from 1 to 3 h after the reperfusion with the peak at 1 h, and the signals were much stronger in the ischemic penumbra (IP) than ischemic core (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of E-/A+ cells was larger in both the IC and IP than that of p-ERK single positive cells (E+/A-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The E+/A- cells were primarily expressed at 1 h in the IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of p-ERK plus p-Akt double positive cells (E+/A+) peaked at 1 h, and the intensity was much stronger in the IP than IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that p-ERK and p-Akt play independent roles, respectively as emergency or maintenance signal for survival at an early stage after reperfusion, and that both signals were cooperatively expressed especially in the IP </plain></SENT>
