<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose-response for in vitro neuroprotection against both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> toxicity and combined oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) was determined in murine neocortical cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of neocortical cells from feta mice were injured by exposure to 500 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> for 10 min or to OGD for 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of CGS 19755 in both injury paradigms was assessed morphologically and quantitated by determination of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Near complete neuroprotection was found at high doses of CGS 19755 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ED50 for protection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> toxicity was 25.4 micro M, and against OGD the ED50 was 15.2 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the in vivo paradigm rabbits underwent 2 h of left internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 4 h reperfusion; ischemic injury was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were treated with 40 mg/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CGS 19755 or saline 10 min after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF and brain levels of CGS 19755 were 12 microM and 5 microM, respectively, at 1 h, 6 microM and 5 microM at 2 h, and 13 microM and 7 microM at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These levels were neuroprotective in this model, reducing cortical ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by 48% and ischemic neuronal damage by 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a single i.v. dose penetrates the blood-brain barrier, attaining sustained neuroprotective levels that are in the range for in vitro neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
