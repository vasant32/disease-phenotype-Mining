<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions were identified on DW-EPI as hyperintense regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before changes were detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques in 12 cases studied earlier than 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The earliest case was verified on DW-EPI at 50 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultra-fast imaging technique took less than 2 minutes to perform even for restless patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had cardioembolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and emergent percutaneous transluminal recanalization was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chronological changes in the signal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> on DW-EPI depended on the site and size of the lesion, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of basal ganglia, and/or massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to major vessel occlusion, and were affected by associated hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronal DW-EPI could more easily demarcate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the brainstem and/or cerebellum than axial scans when susceptibility artifacts were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coronal scans also demonstrated the site and direction of the pyramidal tract and its anatomical correlation with the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DW-EPI has potential for the diagnostic and therapeutic planning of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
