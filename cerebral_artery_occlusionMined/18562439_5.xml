<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a rat model for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) has been developed using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), followed by an 18-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild stress (CMS) paradigm in conjuncture with isolation rearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The open-field test (OFT) and the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption test were used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like behaviour and the effects of the antidepressant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMS induced behavioural changes in the ischemic animals, including decreased locomotor and rearing activity and reduced <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> preference (compared with baseline, control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups respectively), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these behaviours were reversed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the recovery period for the PSD models, the open-field activity and preference for sweet <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> solution decreased continually, opposed to rats subjected to stress only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased locomotor and rearing represents activity deficits, whereas reduced <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> preference may indicate desensitisation of the brain reward mechanism (<z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo>, one of the core symptoms in patients with PSD, and activity deficits can be found in the MCAO+CMS group of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> can ameliorate the behavioural abnormalities observed in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With high validity, good operability and repeatability, our findings suggest that the ischemic rat CMS model is an appropriate model for further PSD research </plain></SENT>
