<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Free radical scavengers protect brain tissue from ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we examined the neuroprotective action of NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (carboxy-PTIO), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> experiments were performed in a randomized fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments, adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 31) subjected to permanent MCAO were treated with carboxy-PTIO (0.3, 0.6 mg/kg) or vehicle (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline) injected intraperitoneally (IP) 1 hr before permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments, adult C57BL/6NCrj mice (n = 49) were treated with carboxy-PTIO (0.6, 1.2 mg/kg) or vehicle saline 30 min following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral scores were determined 22-24 hr following permanent MCAO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes determined by quantitative image analysis of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC)-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-treatment with carboxy-PTIO at 0.6 mg/kg IP in rats significantly attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (19.9 +/- 2.9%; n = 10) as compared with vehicle-treated controls (29.2 +/- 2.7%; n = 16), but not at 0.3 mg/kg (28.3 +/- 8.4%; n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-MCAO treatment in mice with 0.6 mg/kg carboxy-PTIO (30.3 +/- 3.9%; n = 16) significantly attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as compared with vehicle-treated controls (46.1 +/- 2.8%; n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that NO scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, provides significant ischemic neuroprotection when given as a pre-treatment as well as after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in two animal species </plain></SENT>
