<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burst suppression was produced for 15 min before MCAo and maintained throughout the ischemic period by 2.18 +/- 0.11% (mean +/- SE) end-expired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or 135 +/- 18 mg.kg-1 thiopental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure was supported with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> and maintained at approximately 90 mmHg in both groups throughout the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the ischemic period, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> was discontinued, allowing the animals to awaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensive care was provided as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function was scored for 8 days at the end of which surviving animals were killed and the brains were fixed in formalin and then examined for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in final neurologic outcome between the animals receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> as determined by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores ranged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (one of eight in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and three of nine in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting from brain injury (three in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group and five in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>-treated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There also was no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
