<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The interpretation of cognitive data in many experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies is problematic because middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) is associated with sensorimotor alterations that may become confounding factors in cognitive testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to determine if it is possible to measure MCAO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> by using short durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> that do not result in alterations in sensorimotor behavior in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to 60 or 90 minutes of intraluminal MCAO or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first cohort of animals (n=12/group), locomotor activity, balance, and coordination were evaluated 2 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort of animals (n=10/group), the effects of 60 minutes of MCAO on subsequent learning and memory were assessed with a step-down passive avoidance task beginning 1 week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a third cohort of animals (n=8 to 10/group), training in a passive avoidance task was completed before 60 minutes of MCAO, then retention of the task was assessed 1 week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, infarction size was determined after 14 days of reperfusion with use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining and quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in infarction volume in the cerebral cortex or caudoputamen after 60 versus 90 minutes of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant increase in latency to move 1 body length in the 90-minute MCAO group compared with the 60-minute MCAO and sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 additional cohorts of animals, 60-minute MCAO was associated with a deficit in the acquisition and retention of a passive avoidance task regardless of whether the task training occurred before or after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> can be induced in mice by using a short duration of MCAO (60 minutes) that does not result in concomitant sensorimotor deficits </plain></SENT>
