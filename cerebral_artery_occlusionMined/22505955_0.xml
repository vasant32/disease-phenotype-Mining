<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work has demonstrated that genetic-deficiency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">Mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin(MBL) ameliorates reperfusion injury and improves outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to further delineate the pathogenic role of MBL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to examine whether the neuroprotection associated with MBL-deficiency is sustained beyond the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genetic MBL deficiency would suppress complement activation and ameliorate reperfusion injury in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, but that persistent inhibition of complement into the sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase would serve to abrogate this neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The time-course and localization of post-ischemic cerebral MBL and C3 deposition were characterized using both Western-blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MBL-a/c null(MBL-KO) mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(MCAO) were then employed to investigate the histologic injury and functional outcome associated with genetic MBL deletion at both 24 hours and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MBL-a/c rapidly deposit on ischemic endothelium and trigger downstream complement activation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic deficiency of MBL abrogates C3 cleavage as well as the sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> accumulation of mononuclear cells in the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although MBL-KO mice demonstrate significantly improved outcome at 24 hours, the neuroprotective effect associated with genetic MBL deletion is not sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Development of a successful anti-complement neuroprotective strategy will require carefully-tailored inhibition coupled with a greater understanding of the functional effects of complement activation during later phases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
