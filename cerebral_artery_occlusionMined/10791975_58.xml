<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that in addition to its defect in cytokine maturation, caspase-11-deficient mice have a reduced number of apoptotic cells and a defect in caspase-3 activation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant procaspase-11 can autoprocess itself in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified active recombinant caspase-11 cleaves and activates procaspase-3 very efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a positional scanning combinatorial library method, we found that the optimal cleavage site of caspase-11 was (I/L/V/P)EHD, similar to that of upstream caspases such as caspase-8 and -9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that caspase-11 is a critical initiator caspase responsible for the activation of caspase-3, as well as caspase-1 under certain pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
