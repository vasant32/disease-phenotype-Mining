<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation of MMP-9 is involved in blood-brain barrier breakdown and tissue remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MMPs are released to the extracellular space, but the form and fate of secreted enzymes in brain are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using microdialysis in vivo, the authors studied whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced MMP-9 in brain tissue was related to free MMP-9 in the extracellular fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A microdialysis probe was placed into the right striatum and microdialysis was initiated 24 hours later in controls (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour prior to microdialysis, a group of rats (n = 7) was subjected to 1-hour occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dialysates were collected at discrete time points up to 24 hours, and subjected to zymography and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MMP-9 was released after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and accumulated in the extracellular space at 24 hours (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Free MMP-9 forms include mainly the 95-kd proform, and, to a lesser extent, dimers and cleaved active forms (70 kd), but not the 88-kd form found in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probe implantation and microdialysis increased free MMP-9 in the dialysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase was concomitant with neutrophil infiltration after the mechanical lesion, as myeloperoxidase was found by means of Western blot analysis in the brain hemisphere subjected to microdialysis (P &lt; 0.005), and immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of myeloperoxidase stain surrounding the site of probe implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that certain forms of MMP-9 are released and accumulate in the extracellular space after brain injury, and that vascular alterations and neutrophil recruitment elicit MMP-9 activation in the brain after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and trauma </plain></SENT>
