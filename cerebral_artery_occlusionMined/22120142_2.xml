<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous clinical studies have documented a close relationship between cerebrovascular disease and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined possible mechanistic interactions through use of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models in a transgenic mouse model of β-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> (APPswe/PS1dE9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we observed a rapid increase in amyloid plaque burden in the region surrounding the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human tissue samples, however, we were unable to detect a localized increase in amyloid burden adjacent to cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To resolve this discrepancy, we generated cerebral microstrokes in amyloid precursor protein mouse models with the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose bengal</z:chebi>, and monitored plaque formation in real time using multiphoton microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a striking increase in the number of new plaques and amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> in the area immediately surrounding the infarcted area; however, the effect was transient, potentially resolving the discord between mouse and human tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not detect changes in candidate proteins related to β-amyloid generation or degradation such as β-amyloid-converting enzyme, amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, neprylisin or insulin-degrading enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> can trigger accelerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath>, most likely through interference with amyloid clearance pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this study indicates that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> provides an experimental paradigm in which to study the mechanisms of plaque seeding and growth </plain></SENT>
