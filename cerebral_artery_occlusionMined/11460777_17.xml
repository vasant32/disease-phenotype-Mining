<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, remyelination of denuded or regenerating axons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area has been observed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), a major component of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system myelin, in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in adult rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and correlated it to the expression of the growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> and sprouting, using non-radioactive in situ hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, MBP <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) had disappeared by 24 h, whereas myelin protein, identified by MBP and myelin oligodendrocyte <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (MOG) immunohistochemistry, appeared structurally intact until day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> oligodendrocytes increased their expression of MBP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from 24 h to maximal levels at day 7, corresponding to the appearance of process-bearing MBP and occasional MOG-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes in parallel sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis revealed significant increases in the density of oligodendrocytes (up to 7.6-fold) and in the level of MBP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressed by individual cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parallel sections showed that increased expression of GAP-43 mRNA in neurons was concomitant to MBP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> upregulation in oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the mechanisms regulating oligodendrocyte survival and myelination signals are not clear at this point, axonal sprouting could putatively serve as a stimulus for the upregulation of oligodendrocyte cell numbers, differentiation state, and/or active myelination in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
