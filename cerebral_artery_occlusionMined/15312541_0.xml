<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression and the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected neural stem cells (NSCs) in rat brain subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fetal NSCs were cultured from E14 days SD rats and transfected with VEGF121 gene by using lipofectAMINE technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of transfected cells was detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) model was established in 40 SD rats and then rate were randomly divided into (1) control group (n = 10), (2) PBS transplantation group (n = 10), (3) neural stem cells transplantation group (n = 10), and (4) VEGF-secreting neural stem cells transplantation group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BrdU-labelled NSCs and VEGF-secreting NSCs were transplanted into the penumbra zones respectively 3 days after the tMCAO model was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was checked in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 weeks respectively after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One and 12 weeks after the transplantation, 10 rats in the group (4) were killed and then brains taken out respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using immunofluorescent staining, the VEGF expression of transplanted cells 1 week after transplantation, differentiation and migration of transplanted neural stem cells 12 week after transplantation were detected respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF-transfected neural stem cells could continuously express gene products during the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both transfected NSCs and their progeny expressed VEGF gene products, which was demonstrated by fluorescence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in NSS in groups 4 when tMCAO models were just established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the values of NSS in (4) group were 5.8 +/- 1.5, 5.0 +/- 1.0, 4.6 +/- 1.0, 4.0 +/- 0.7, 4.0 +/- 1.0, 3.8 +/- 0.4 from 2 approximately 12 weeks after transplantation, significantly lower than those in groups (1) and (2) 8 weeks (P = 0.008) and those in groups (1), (2) and (3) 12 weeks (P = 0.000) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NSS in group (3) was also lower than that in groups (1) and (2) 8 and 12 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One week after transplantation, immunofluorescent staining showed that VEGF-transfected NSCs migrated and expressed VEGF into hosts' brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks after transplantation, transplanted NSCs survived and migrated, some of them differentiated to neurons and integrated well with hosts' cytoarchitectural components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VEGF-transfected NSCs express gene products during the early time after transplantation, which reduce brain injury through protecting the vascular system against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of VEGF-transfected NSCs might be a novel method for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
