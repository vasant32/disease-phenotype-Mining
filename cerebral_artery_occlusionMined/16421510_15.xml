<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Occlusive cerebrovascular disease leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> that causes neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we introduce a new strategy combining mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and ex vivo hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene transferring with a multimutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type-1 vector in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene-transferred MSCs were intracerebrally transplanted into the rats' ischemic brains at 2 h (superacute) or 24 h (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests showed significant improvement of neurological deficits in the HGF-transferred MSCs (MSC-HGF)-treated group compared with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated and MSCs-only-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant difference of infarction areas on day 3 was detected only between the MSC-HGF group and the PBS group with the superacute treatment, but was detected among each group on day 14 with both transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the superacute transplantation, we detected abundant expression of HGF protein in the ischemic brain of the MSC-HGF group compared with others on day 1 after treatment, and it was maintained for at least 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we determined that the increased expression of HGF was derived from the transferred HGF gene in gene-modified MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-positive cells in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) was significantly decreased, while that of remaining neurons in the cortex of the IBZ was significantly increased in the MSC-HGF group compared with others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that combined therapy is more therapeutically efficient than MSC cell therapy alone, and it may extend the therapeutic time window from superacute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
