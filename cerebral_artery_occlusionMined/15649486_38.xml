<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new test of vibrissae-elicited forelimb placing ability that allows testing of sensorimotor integration across the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were given unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> using one of three methods: (1) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) causing significant damage to the cortex and striatum, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> lesions to remove tissue from the sensorimotor cortex, and (3) infusions of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle, producing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parkinsonian syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Application of the new test to these animals revealed that with some lesion types, the ability of vibrissae on the unimpaired side of the body to trigger placing in the functionally impaired forelimb recovers before vibrissae on the impaired side can elicit placing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This occurs despite the lack of any apparent vibrissae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e>, since the contralesional vibrissae maintained the ability to trigger placing in the unimpaired forelimb in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chronically, MCAo-lesioned rats do not place the impaired forelimb upon stimulation of the impaired-side vibrissae, but do place if the vibrissae on the good side are stimulated (i.e., when the placing is triggered "across the midline") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats which, consistent with parkinsonian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002304'>akinesia</z:hpo>, cannot place the impaired limb regardless of sensory trigger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, differences in the pattern of recovery between MCAo- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>-lesioned rats suggest a possible anatomical substrate for cross-midline placing ability and its recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike other tests, cross-midline placing methods can readily distinguish between severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
