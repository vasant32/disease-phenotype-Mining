<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason for this difference is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), arterial and venous O2 saturation, and O2 extraction were compared in the ischemic cortex and in the nonischemic brain regions of rats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> using a microspectrophotometric technique that directly measures the O2 saturation of blood in the small arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight rats were anesthetized with 1.4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or 50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour after a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, rCBF was measured in the ischemic cortex and in the nonischemic brain regions using <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine in one-half of each group of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional arterial and venous O2 saturation were determined using microspectrophotometry in the other one-half of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rCBF of the ischemic cortex (IC) and the non-ischemic contralateral cortex (CC) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group were significantly higher than those of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The venous O2 saturation was significantly less, and the O2 extraction was significantly higher, in the IC than in the nonischemic regions in both groups of animals (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> group, IC 10.5 +/- 1.1 ml O2.100 ml blood-1, CC 6.3 +/- 0.7; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group, IC 10.8 +/- 0.6, CC 5.9 +/- 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because the rCBF was less and the O2 extraction was similar, O2 consumption in the focal ischemic area of the brain during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia must have been less than that during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
