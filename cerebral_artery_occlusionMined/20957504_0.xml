<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms for this potentially reversible ischemic region remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generated permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (PI) and reperfusion after inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 1.5 h (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion or IR) in a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using immunofluorescence, we observed hypoxic tissue in ischemic brains and assessed microvessel density in and surrounding the hypoxic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the hypoxic tissues were observed at 1 and 3 days in PI rats and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days in IR rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hypoxic tissue gradually decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microvessel density increased in a time-dependent manner in focal brain ischemic tissue in PI and IR rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IR induced a significant increase in microvessel density when compared with PI rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density surrounding hypoxic tissue was significantly higher when compared with within the hypoxic tissue (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that hypoxic tissue may exist for a long period (14 days) following brain IR and indicate that hypoxic tissue usually existed with low microvessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the duration of hypoxic tissue was partially dependent on the degree of microvessel proliferation </plain></SENT>
