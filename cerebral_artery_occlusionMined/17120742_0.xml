<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours of reperfusion was allowed after PC and before permanent MCAO to establish ischemic tolerance (IT) to compare with non-PC (sham-operated) rats (n = 5 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological deficits were measured 24 h after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples of brain were taken for the determination of HSP70 expression by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> administered just before PC or administered long after PC but just before PMCAO on IT were also determined (n = 5 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01) only if PC was performed after 24 h, and PC significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced neurological deficits (similar to reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> eliminated ischemic PC-induced IT effects on bothbrain injury and neurological deficits if administered before PC but not if administered long after PC but before PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PC produced no brain injury but did increase HSP70 protein 24 h after PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">Cycloheximide</z:chebi> eliminated that effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that PC is a powerful inducer of ischemic brain tolerance as reflected by the preservation of brain tissue and motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PC induces IT that is dependent on de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
