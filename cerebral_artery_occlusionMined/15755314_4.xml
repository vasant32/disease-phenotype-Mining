<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>4-Substituted MeSO2-PCBs, tolylfluanid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> displayed antagonistic effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-induced tyrosine aminotransferase specific activity (IC50 ranging from 0.7-5.1 microM), but no <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These substances also had affinity to the mouse <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor in competition binding studies, indicating that the inhibition of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-activity is indeed mediated by receptor binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, substances with a structural resemblance with a <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29825">sulfonyl group</z:chebi>, such as the <z:chebi fb="41" ids="24127">fungicide</z:chebi> tolylfluanid, may inhibit <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor-regulated gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In co-exposure experiments with three substances, multivariate modelling showed that the inhibitory effect of 4-MeSO2-2,5,6,2',4'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36721">pentachlorobiphenyl</z:chebi> (4-MeSO2-CB91), 4-MeSO2-2,3,6,2',4',5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36722">hexachlorobiphenyl</z:chebi> (4-MeSO2-CB149) and tolylfluanid on tyrosine aminotransferase activity was close to additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, co-exposure to such different chemicals as persistent organic pollutants and pesticides may affect cells additively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemical interference with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> hormone system therefore deserves further attention in vivo </plain></SENT>
