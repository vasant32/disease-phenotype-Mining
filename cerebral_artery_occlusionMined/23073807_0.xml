<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, sham-operated group, model group and EA+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51088">TMS group</z:chebi>, and each group was then divided into five sub-groups in terms of the different time to start treatment post operation: 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> models were established in the model and the EA+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51088">TMS groups</z:chebi> by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After treatment for 14 d, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test was applied to examine the spatial learning and memory abilities of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In infarcted area, the expression of caspase-3 was immunohistochemically detected, and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that in EA+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51088">TMS group</z:chebi> compared with model group at the same treatment time windows, the escape latency was substantially shortened, the expression of caspase-3 was considerably decreased and the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the EA+TMS sub-groups, the escape latency was shortest, the expression level of caspase-3 lowest, and the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA highest at the treatment time window of 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that EA combined with TMS can promote neurological function of rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by increasing the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA and decreasing the expression of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best time window is 24 h after perfusion treatment to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
