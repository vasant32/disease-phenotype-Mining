<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals have mastered this task when they need less time to find the platform in the second of the two trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, study, male C57BL mice were trained on this task with massed, spaced, or spaced delay trials in which there was a 90-min delay between the first and second trials of a pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice trained with spaced trials learned the repeated acquisition task, whereas the mice trained with massed or spaced delay trials were not consistently able to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the mice had reached a stable baseline performance, the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded or the mice were sham-operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, the effects of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O) on the performance in the repeated acquisition tasks were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion hardly affected the performance in this task, irrespective of the spacing condition of the trials, although surgery per se seemed to have a transient disruptive effect </plain></SENT>
