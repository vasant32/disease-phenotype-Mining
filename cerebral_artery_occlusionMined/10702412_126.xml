<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and thereby may counteract the detrimental neurological effects associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight to seventy-two hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> we found a strong increase in the number of newly formed vessels at the border of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> marker nitroimidazole EF5, we detected hypoxic cells in the ischemic border of the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is the main regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and is inducible by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, was strongly up-regulated in the ischemic border, at times between 6 and 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, both VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) were up-regulated at the border after 48 hours and later in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the two transcription factors, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and HIF-2, known to be involved in the regulation of VEGF and VEGFR gene expression, were increased in the ischemic border after 72 hours, suggesting a regulatory function for these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the VEGF/VEGFR system, induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, leads to the growth of new vessels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous support of this natural protective mechanism might lead to enhanced survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
