<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> models were established by using left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were randomly divided into a model group (n=40) and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51088">TMS group</z:chebi> (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TMS treatment (2 times per day, 30 pulses per time) with a frequency of 0.5 Hz and magnetic field intensity of 1.33 Tesla was carried out in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51088">TMS group</z:chebi> after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modified neurological severity score (NSS) were recorded before and 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 day(s) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-Fos and BDNF was immunohistochemically detected 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 day(s) after infarction respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that a significant recovery of NSS (P&lt;0.05) was found in animals treated by TMS on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 as compared with the animals in the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive expression of c-Fos and BDNF was detected in the cortex surrounding the infarction areas, while the expression of c-Fos and BDNF increased significantly in TMS treatment group in comparison with those in model group 7, 14, 21, and 28 days (P&lt;0.05) and 7, 14, 21 days (P&lt;0.01) after infarction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that TMS has therapeutic effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and this may have something to do with TMS's ability to promote the expression of c-Fos and BDNF of the cerebral cortex in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
