<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Scutellarin (Scu) is the major active principle (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi>) extracted from Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand-Mazz, a Chinese herbal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we investigated the effects of Scu on brain injury through the inhibition of AIF-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with Scu for 7 d and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 22 h of reperfusion, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the neurological deficit were determined by TTC staining and Longa's score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IN SITU end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragments (TUNEL) was employed to determine the degree of DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> content and PARP activity in brain homogenate were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of AIF in the nucleus was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that Scu significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ameliorated the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells and a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> level were also observed after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time, Scu (50 and 75 mg kg (-1), i. g.) treatment reversed brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and reduced DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scu also inhibited PARP overactivation and AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus following cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the neuroprotective effects of Scu on brain ischemic injury-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might be associated with inhibition of PARP-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and subsequent translocation of AIF </plain></SENT>
