<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that liposomal agents quickly accumulated in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion region and ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury when they were injected after reperfusion in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that liposomes also act effectively as a drug carrier in the ischemic state, since the integrity of the blood brain barrier is disrupted at an early stage after an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, the cerebral distribution of fluorescence-labeled liposomes was observed in permanent MCAO (p-MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The liposomes accumulated in the ischemic core and the penumbra region when injected at 1 or 2 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accumulation in the ischemic core region was clearly greater than that in the penumbra region, despite the cerebral blood perfusion of the core region being substantially reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that drug delivery to an ischemic region using liposomes is possible even when cerebral blood circulation has not recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because liposomal drug delivery systems have the potential to effectively employ a number of agents that have failed in clinical trials, they may offer an effective strategy for achieving neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
