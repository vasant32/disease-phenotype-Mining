<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, we administered a 120-minute left MCAO to male Sprague-Dawley rats and randomly assigned them to one of four groups: no exercise (Group 1), mild exercise (Group 2), moderate exercise (Group 3), and severe exercise (Group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we trained the rats for 30 min per day for one week or two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a five-point neurological evaluation scale to measure neurological deficits 1-day, 4-days, 7-days, 10-days and 14-days after MCAO and measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by use of 2% 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> in exercised brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed immunohistochemistry analysis of the brain to observe reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> at the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological examination indicated that Group 2 and 3 recovered better than Group 1 after one week and two weeks (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Group 2 and 3 had reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with Group 1 after one week (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between Group 4 and Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in Group 4 relative to Group 1 after one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the extent of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> and neurological recovery (r = -0.648, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that mild to moderate exercise that begins soon after induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> promotes recovery and that astrocytes may have an important role in the recovery process </plain></SENT>
