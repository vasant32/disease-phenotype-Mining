<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>On the basis of their promising experimental evidence, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> are today largely used in clinical practice for treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose a meta-analytical evaluation of published clinical trials on nimodipine, a dihydropiridin calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 112 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among 682 patients randomized to active treatment compared with 154 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 689 control patients (odds ratio of 0.68, 95% confidence interval of 0.52 to 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome due to delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was also lower in the group allocated to receive nimodipine (odds ratio of 0.47, 95% confidence interval of 0.36 to 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 382 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among 2056 patients allocated to receive nimodipine compared to 288 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 1462 control patients (odds ratio of 0.98, 95% confidence interval of 0.82 to 1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled results strongly suggest a protective effect of nimodipine in delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and no effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but the direction and the significance of these results are due to the contribution of a single large trial on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and of two trials on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which account respectively for 40% and 65% of randomized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dissociated effect of nimodipine on these similar conditions could be related to its preventive role in ischemic damage, resembling animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> where a beneficial effect of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> was clearly shown only when treatment was started before experimental cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this view, the negative results obtained from the clinical setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> seem to indicate nimodipine as an aspecific neuroprotective agent without a curative effect </plain></SENT>
