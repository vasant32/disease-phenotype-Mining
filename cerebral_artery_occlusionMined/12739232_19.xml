<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), cleaved caspase-9 (c-cas9), and -3 (c-cas3) increased after the reperfusion in the penumbra in vehicle group with peaks at 3 h, 8 h, and 1 day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical application of GDNF (6.8 micrograms/9 microliters) on brain surface potentiated and prolonged p-Akt activation, but suppressed activation of the caspases, and reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28850">dUDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick labeling (TUNEL) positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that GDNF plays a protective role against ischemic injury by controlling the balance between Akt pathway and caspase cascades </plain></SENT>
