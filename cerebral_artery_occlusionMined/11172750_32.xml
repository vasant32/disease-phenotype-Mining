<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate p38 MAPK activation following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and determine whether SB 239063, a novel second generation p38 inhibitor, would directly attenuate early neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), brains were dissected into ischemic and non-ischemic cortices and Western blots were employed to measure p38 MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging were utilized at various time points following MCAO to monitor the development and resolution of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, there was an early (15 min) activation of p38 MAPK (2.3-fold) which remained elevated up to 1 h (1.8-fold) post injury compared to non-ischemic and sham operated tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral SB 239063 (5, 15, 30, 60 mg/kg) administered to each animal 1 h pre- and 6 h post MCAO provided significant (P&lt;0.05) dose-related neuroprotection reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 42, 48, 29 and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most effective dose (15 mg/kg) was further evaluated in detail and SB 239063 significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced neurologic deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by at least 30% from 24 h through at least 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early (i.e. observed within 2 h) reductions in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) intensity following treatment with SB 239063 correlated (r=0.74, P&lt;0.01) to neuroprotection seen up to 7 days post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since increased protein levels for various pro-inflammatory cytokines cannot be detected prior to 2 h in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, the early improvements due to p38 inhibition, observed using DWI, demonstrate that p38 inhibition can be neuroprotective through direct effects on ischemic brain cells, in addition to effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
