<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the induction of TGF-β1-3 in the rat after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at 3 h, 24 h, 72 h and 1 month after transient (1 h) or permanent (24 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using in situ hybridization histochemistry and quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double labeling with different markers was used to identify the localization of TGF-β <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> relative to the penumbra and glial scar, and the types of cells expressing TGF-βs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TGF-β1 expression increased 3 h after MCAO in the penumbra and was further elevated 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGF-β1 was present mostly in microglial cells but also in some astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 72 h and 1 month after the occlusion, TGF-β1 mRNA-expressing cells also appeared in microglia within the ischemic core and in the glial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TGF-β2 mRNA level was increased in neurons but not in astrocytes or microglial cells in layers II, III, and V of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGF-β3 was not induced in cells around the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its expression increased in only a few cells in layer II of the cerebral cortex 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of TGF-β2 and -β3 decreased at subsequent time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO further elevated the levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 subtypes of TGF-βs suggesting that reperfusion is not a major factor in their induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TGF-β1 did not co-localize with either Fos or ATF-3, while the co-localization of TGF-β2 with Fos but not with ATF-3 suggests that cortical spreading depolarization, but not damage to neural processes, might be the mechanism of induction for TGF-β2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results imply that endogenous TGF-βs are induced by different mechanisms following an ischemic attack in the brain suggesting that they are involved in distinct spatially and temporally regulated inflammatory and neuroprotective processes </plain></SENT>
