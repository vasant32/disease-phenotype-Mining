<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with the H2 clearance technique in the center and periphery of the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decrease of CBF to about 50% of pre-occlusion values was observed in both areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27953">Physostigmine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, at a dose of 0.15 mg/Kg by intravenous route, induced an increase of CBF in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This change in CBF reached 120% of pre-occlusion level in the periphery and 80% of pre-occlusion value in the center of the area of distribution of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27953">Physostigmine</z:chebi> induced an increase in arterial blood pressure, the cerebral hyperemia observed both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic cortex could still be demonstrated after blockade of the pressor effect by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or Phentolamine administration </plain></SENT>
