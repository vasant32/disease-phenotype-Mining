<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 approximately 280 g, n=144) were divided into control, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 min, and HBO-PC plus MCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC was conducted four times by giving 100% oxygen at 2.5 atm absolute (ATA), for 1 h at 12 h intervals for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after the last HBO-PC, MCAO was performed and at 24 h after MCAO, neurological function, brain water content, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic activity of capase-3 and -9, and expression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were performed in the samples from hippocampus, ischemic penumbra and core of the brain cortex, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, decreased infarction volume, and improved neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC reduced cytoplasm <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> levels, decreased caspase enzyme activity, upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax expression, and abated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HBO-PC protects brain tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury by suppressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
