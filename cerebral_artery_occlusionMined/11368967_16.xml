<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were given vehicle or dexanabinol (4.5 mg/kg) 1, 3 or 6 h after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The research consisted of 2 stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the short-term set of experiments animals (n=5/group), were tested with a motor disability scale 24 h post PMCAO, then sacrificed and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured using 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the long-term set of experiments the rats (n=7/group) were examined daily with a motor disability scale up to 30 days after PMCAO and then sacrificed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined using TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor scores were significantly improved in the dexanabinol treated rats (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the time points examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly reduced 24 h after PMCAO in the groups treated 1 or 3 h, but not 6 h after PMCAO compared with vehicle (Mean+/-S.D., 11.5+/-2.02, 12+/-3.2 and 14.4+/-2.4% vs. 20.8+/-1.3% hemispheric volume respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesions remained significantly smaller in the dexanabinol groups 30 days after PMCAO (Mean+/-S.D., 24.49+/-1.9% vs. 8.1+/-0.6, 11.1+/-2.3 and 13.8+/-2.5% hemispheric volume in animals treated with vehicle vs. dexanabinol 1, 3 or 6 h after PMCAO respectively; P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the extended therapeutic window and the multi-mechanistic durable neuroprotective effects of dexanabinol make it a promising candidate for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
