<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In male mice, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induces immunosuppression of the peripheral immune system, characterized by a reduction in spleen size and cell numbers and decreased cytokine and chemokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced immunosuppression has not been evaluated in female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) deficiency exacerbates immunosuppression after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in females, we evaluated the effect of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and peripheral and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> immune responses in ovariectomized mice with or without sustained, controlled levels of 17-beta-E2 administered by s.c. implant or the putative membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both E2- and G1-replacement decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and partially restored splenocyte numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, E2-replacement <z:mp ids='MP_0009336'>increased splenocyte proliferation</z:mp> in response to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs and normalized aberrant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors and percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells observed in E2-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These beneficial changes in peripheral immunity after E2 replacement were accompanied by a profound reduction in expression of the chemokine, MIP-2, and a 40-fold increased expression of CCR7 in the lesioned brain hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate for the first time that E2 replacement in ovariectomized female mice improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced peripheral immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
