<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, NIHSS) has become the most popular used scale to assess the initial and final neurological status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who receive experimental drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the problems with this scale in our country is the language question, making mandatory to adapt it into Spanish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To obtain a Spanish version of the NIHSS and verify that it has the same advantages and utilities as the original version </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Spanish translation of the original version of NIHSS was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final Spanish version for the different items and the instructions to carry out each one of the items were decided by consensus by the neurovascular unit team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The word list and sentences and the drawings of objects and that used to assess visual extinction were obtained from the Boston <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> test (adapted previously to our language) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once adapted to the Spanish version, the NIHSS, scores obtained during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase were correlated with the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and with the location of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As predictable, there is a good correlation between the neurological situation of the patient (NIHSS) and the presence of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> assessed by Transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Doppler situation at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 hours was significantly related (p = 0.001) with the NIHSS at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a good correlation between the NIHSS score and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured by computed tomography (n = 72; r = 0.794; p &lt; 0.0001) and by magnetic resonance diffusion- 192 weighted image (n = 38; r = 0.674; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This adaptation of the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale to Spanish will allow wider availability and routine use in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units </plain></SENT>
