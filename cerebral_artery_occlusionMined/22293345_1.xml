<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Danshen, derived from the dried root or rhizome of Salviae miltiorrhizae BGE., has Tanshinone IIA (TSA) as one of its active ingredients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have shown that TSA can inhibit the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by serum withdrawal or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> in cultured PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether TSA has any neuroprotective effect remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of TSA on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> had been induced 2 h earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were assessed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal administration of 25 and 40 mg/kg TSA 10 min after MCAO significantly diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and brain water content and improved neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 25 mg/kg dosage was more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 25 mg/kg TSA significantly improved symptoms and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at different points in time, of which 10 min after MCAO was the most significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nissl-staining and HE-staining of the 25 mg/kg TSA group were more appreciable in terms of improvement relative to the vehicle group in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TSA of dosage 25 mg/kg significantly decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein and increased the expression of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (bcl-2) protein in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fewer terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were found in the penumbra of the treated group, but they were significantly more common in the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We here conclude that the neuroprotective effects of TSA against focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury are likely to be related to the attenuation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
