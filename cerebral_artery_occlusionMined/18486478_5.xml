<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>I examined whether human adipose tissue stromal cells (hATSCs) can be induced to undergo neuronal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I isolated hATSCs from human liposuction tissue and induced neuronal differentiation using azacytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After neuronal induction, the hATSCs adopted a more neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These hATSCs were injected into the lateral ventricle of the rat brain, after which they migrated to various parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After ischemic brain injury induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a large number of cells migrated to the injured cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral grafting of hATSCs significantly enhanced the recovery of functional motor deficits in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that transplanted hATSCs survive, migrate and differentiate in the ischemic microenvironment and improve neurological recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
