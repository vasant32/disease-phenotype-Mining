<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is recently revealed playing a key role in anoxic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, nerve growth factor (NGF), through activating TrkA pathway, has been widely accepted as a crucial factor for neuronal survival during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1h and reperfusion for 5, 10, 20 and 30 h revealed an increasing up-regulation of TRPM7 expression in ipsilateral hippocampus after reperfusion and such a change reached a peak at 20 h, with high expression being maintained up to 30 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection of NGF (500 ng) 30 min before MCAO, the expression of TRPM7 at 20 h after reperfusion was significantly reduced, and the effect of NGF was completely abolished by co-injection of TrkA inhibitor K252a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TRPM7 was found residing on hippocampal neuronal body and process, and TrkA was concurrently observed on the cell body by immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In agreement with in vivo, pre-incubation of cultured hippocampal neurons with NGF markedly down-regulated TRPM7 high expression at 20 h after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), and this effect could be abrogated by K252a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, when inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, U73122 and U0126 were introduced to block phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) and ras/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, respectively, only PI-3K inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> substantially abolished NGF effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TrkA, after being activated by NGF, can prevent up-regulation of TRPM7 expression in hippocampal neurons during reperfusion through PI-3K signal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings open a new way for further investigations of the potential roles of TRPM7 and NGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
