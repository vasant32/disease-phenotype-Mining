<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is caused by two events: (i) the ischemic phenomenon by itself; (ii) the self-destructive mechanisms developed as a consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is one of these destructive phenomena that accompanies and exacerbates the developing injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it has been suggested that immune cells participate in neuroprotective and restorative processes, modulation rather than elimination of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> could be a strategy to improve the neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immune modulator <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-1 (Cop-1), a synthetic basic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53521">random copolymer</z:chebi> of amino acids, is a potent inducer of Th2 regulatory cells which, aside from exerting modulatory actions, is capable of releasing neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that Cop-1-specific T cells exert neuroprotective and even restorative effects in diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to test the ability of Cop-1 to prevent ischemic injury in a model of transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, two groups of rats were treated either with Cop-1 or with saline solution (SS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after occlusion, Cop-1 treated rats presented a significant improvement in neurological function compared to SS-treated animals (1.2+/-0.4 and 2.8+/-0.5 mean+/-S.D., respectively; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological findings showed that the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was smaller in Cop-1 treated rats (4.8+/-1.5), in comparison with those receiving SS (32.2+/-8.6; p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cop-1 constitutes a promising therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; thereby, the enforcement of further experimental investigation is encouraged in order to be able to formulate the best strategy </plain></SENT>
