<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of focal cerebral ischemic preconditioning on the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and its target gene inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and to explore its role in ischemic tolerance in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 32 SD rats were divided into 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group received sham surgery (SS) twice only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> + SS group received 10 minutes of ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) followed by SS 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the other two groups received 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 hours of reperfusion with or without <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> 3 days before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure, NF-κB activation and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription were evaluated in each group by electron microscope, immunohistochemistry staining and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In contrast with the SS + SS group, there was a lower NF-κB immunoreactivity (57.3 ± 6.3) and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (29.1% ± 3.1%) in the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> + SS group while no ultrastructural abnormality was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The expression of NF-κB/iNOS was down-regulated in the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> + MCAO group (81.2% ± 7.3%/89.0% ± 5.3%) than in the SS + MCAO group (98.9% ± 9.4%/132.8% ± 7.9%, P &lt; 0.01) with minor ultrastructure abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A down-regulated expression of NF-κB/iNOS is a key event in the molecular mechanism of cerebral ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the NF-κB/iNOS pathway might play a dual role in endogenous neuroprotection induced by focal <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
