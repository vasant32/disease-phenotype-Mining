<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups : <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion group, EA treated group (ischemic rats with EA treatment), TE infusion group (ischemic rats with EA treatment and TE buffer infusion), AS-ODN group (ischemic rats with EA treatment and antisense trkA oligonucleotide infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animal model was established by the modified method of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antisense trkA oligonucleotide that blocked NGFs effects was injected into cerebroventricle before EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TRPM7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by RT-PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there were low TRPM7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in cortex and hippocampus in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, TRPM7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in the expression of TR-PM7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in EA treated group in contrast to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of TRPM7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in AS-ODN group was remarkably increased compared with EA treated group and TE infusion group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that TRPM7 channels in the ischemic cortex and hippocampus in rats might play a key role in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EA could reverse the overexpression of TRPM7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And the inhibitory effect of EA on TRPM7 channels might be through trkA pathway </plain></SENT>
