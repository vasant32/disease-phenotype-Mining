<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the neuroprotective potential of Diammonium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29807">Glycyrrhizinate</z:chebi> (DG) in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of the mouse was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with DG (20mg/kg per day, intraperitoneal injection) or saline as control, from the beginning of the reperfusion to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focal cerebral IR injury resulted in significant neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and brain water content (BWC) at 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in various <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> like interleukin-1 (IL-1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was also observed in the IR challenged brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DG treatment significantly improved neurofunction, decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the focal cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of DG was found to be associated with significant reduction in the IL-1, TNF-α, COX-2, iNOS, NF-κB and GFAP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study suggested that DG has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral IR injury and this effect is likely related to DG's anti-inflammatory function </plain></SENT>
