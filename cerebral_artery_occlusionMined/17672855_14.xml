<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CRMP family members (1-5) was examined in mouse brains that were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the five CRMPs, the expressions of CRMP1, CRMP3 and CRMP5 were the most abundant in the cerebral cortex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CRMPs were targeted for cleavage by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-activated calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sub-cellular fractionation analysis showed that cleavage of CRMPs by calpain occurred not only in the cytoplasm but also in the synaptosomes isolated from ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, synaptosomal CRMPs appeared to be at least one-fold more sensitive to cleavage compared with those isolated from the cytosolic fraction in an in-vitro experiment, suggesting that synaptosomal CRMPs are critical targets during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CRMPs was colocalized with TUNEL-positive neurons in the ischemic mouse brain, which further supports the notion that CRMPs may play an important role in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies demonstrated that CRMPs are targets of calpains during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and they also highlighted an important potential role that CRMPs may play in modulating ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
