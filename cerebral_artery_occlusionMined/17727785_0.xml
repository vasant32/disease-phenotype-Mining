<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish an animal model of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) and assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> on PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> group (n = 6) underwent sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> unpredictable mild stress (CMS) group (n = 6), underwent separate raising and CMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group (n = 24) underwent MCAO and then re-divided into 3 equal subgroups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroup, PSD model subgroup (undergoing isolated raising and CMS so as to establish PSD models), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> subgroup (treated with intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, a selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor for 6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were examined dynamically at the 19th, 28th, and 42nd days after CMS by open-field test (OFT) and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> consumption test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the 19th day after CMS the locomotor activity score of the PSD models was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.001 compared to the baseline level of the same subgroup and to those of the control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats, P &lt; 0.01 compared to the CMS group); and the frequency of rearing score of the PSD models was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.001 compared to its baseline level and to those of the control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups, and P &lt; 0.05 compared to the CMS group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the days 19 - 42, the frequency of locomotor and exploratory activities of the PSD model rats declined continually, from 37.8 +/- 1.7 to 34.2 +/- 1.2 and from 9.7 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 0.8 respectively, showing a tendency in just the reverse direction in the CMS group (from 41.0 +/- 1.3 to 42.3 +/- 0.8 and from 11.2 +/- 0.4 to 11.7 +/- 0.8 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PSD rats showed a reduction in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> preference at week 3 and afterwards (P &lt; 0.001 compared with other groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of open-field activities and proportion of rats with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> preference in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> subgroup were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher than those in other groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>Anhedonia</z:hpo> and underactivity, the core symptoms in the PSD patients, can be found completely and persistently in the PSD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With good operability and repeatability, the PSD rat model is an ideal model for PSD research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">Citalopram</z:chebi> can improve the behavior abnormality in PSD </plain></SENT>
