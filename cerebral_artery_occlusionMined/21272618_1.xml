<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyperus rotundus (family: Cyperaceae), a traditional Indian medicinal herb, used as nervine tonic and nootropic in the Ayurvedic system of medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effect of total oligomeric <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> (TOFs), prepared from C. rotundus, in rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague Dawley rats (290-340g) were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h and reperfusion for 70h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental animals were divided into four groups: Group I - sham operated (n=7); Group II - vehicle treated ischemic-reperfusion (IR) (n=9), and Group III and IV - TOFs treated (100 and 200mg/kg body weight, p.o., respectively; n=7 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vehicle or TOFs were pretreated for four days before the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and continued for next three days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> i.e. treatment was scheduled totally for a period of 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCAO surgery was performed on day 4, 1h after TOFs administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effect of TOFs was substantiated in terms of neurological deficits, excitotoxicity (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase and Na(+)K(+)ATPase levels), <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (malondialdehyde, super <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> dismutase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>) and neurobehavioral functions in the experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TOFs decreased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase (GS) and increased Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity in a dose dependent manner when compared to the IR rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TOFs significantly reduced the neurological deficits and reversed the anxiogenic behavior in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, it also significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> content in brains of experimental rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining revealed the attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> by TOFs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates the unswerving involvement of TOFs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion triggered biochemical alterations in MCAO/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, TOFs might be an attractive candidate for further studies in the development of new drugs for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
