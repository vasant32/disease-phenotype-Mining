<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, DETA-NONOate, up-regulates stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) in the ischemic brain and their respective receptors chemokine CXC motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) and Tie2 in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and thereby promote SVZ neuroblast cell migration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and 24 hr later DETA-NONOate (0.4 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered solution was intravenously administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were sacrificed at 14 days for histological assessment or sacrificed at 3 days for analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction and migration after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether SDF1/CXCR4 and Ang1/Tie2 pathways mediate DETA-NONOate-induced SVZ migration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, SDF1alpha, Ang1 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, a specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of CXCR4 (AMD3100), and a neutralizing antibody of Tie2 (anti-Tie2) were used in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DETA-NONOate significantly increased the percentage area of doublecortin (DCX, a marker of migrating neuroblasts)-immunoreactive cells in the SVZ and ischemic boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DETA-NONOate significantly increased the expression of SDF1 and Ang1 in the ischemic border and up-regulated CXCR4 and Tie2 in the SVZ compared with MCAo control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DCX-positive cell migration from SVZ explants was significantly increased in the DETA-NONOate treatment group compared with MCAo-alone animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, SDF1alpha and Ang1 significantly increased SVZ explants cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, inhibition of CXCR4 or Tie2 significantly attenuated DETA-NONOate-induced SVZ cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> up-regulates SDF1/CXCR4 and Ang1/Tie2 pathways and thereby likely increases SVZ neuroblast cell migration </plain></SENT>
