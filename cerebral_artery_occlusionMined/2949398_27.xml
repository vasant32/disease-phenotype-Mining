<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The appearance and evolution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> over 3 days following proximal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in SHR rats were measured non-invasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were clearly visible in coronal, T2 weighted brain sections, 24, 48 and 72 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the left hemisphere, as areas of increased NMR signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were quantified by pixel counting in each section, the sum of 4 sections representing an accurate estimate of the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location and extent of infarction, determined by MRI, were found to be highly reproducible and correlated well with post-mortem histological and biochemical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neurological score, made every 24 h, paralleled the evolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, which culminated after 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- or post-treatment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> PN 200-110 resulted in a substantial reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, determined by MRI 24, 48 and 72 h after infarction, compared to vehicle treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were corroborated by corresponding improvements of the neurological scores as well as histological and biochemical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment with nimodipine showed qualitatively similar effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the notion that calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, through vascular and/or metabolic mechanisms, are effective in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since they were obtained in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, relevant model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a method directly applicable also to humans, they should encourage further clinical studies with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
