<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal occlusion of one middle cerebral artery for 6 h resulted in histologically detectable brain damage within the ipsilateral caudate putamen, basolateral cortex and parts of the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the infarcted basolateral cortex and thalamus fragmentation of DNA was detected in many nuclei using in-situ end-labeling of DNA breaks by terminal transferase, whereas only scattered labeled nuclei were visible in the infarcted caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed activation of c-Fos in the infarcted cortex and thalamus and in the non-infarcted cingulate cortex as has been shown by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease in immunoreactivity for Bcl-2, and Bcl-X and an increase in immunostaining for Bax was observed exclusively in neurons within the ischemic cortex and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the infarcted caudate putamen, however, protein levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bcl-2 family members declined and c-Fos remained absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction it was demonstrated that levels of bcl-2 mRNA markedly decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas the amount of bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a shift in the ratio of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> repressor Bcl-2 to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effector Bax and a concomitant activation of c-Fos may contribute to neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the infarcted thalamus and cortex </plain></SENT>
