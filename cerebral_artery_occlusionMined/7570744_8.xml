<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of the intra-arterial injection of nimodipine at reperfusion on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats subjected to partially reversible focal neocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of Long-Evans rats with transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were subjected to retrograde cannulation of the external carotid artery close to the carotid bifurcation to allow the administration of isotonic saline (group 1) or nimodipine solution (group 2) just before and during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimate for the actual amount of infarcted cortex was calculated by the volume ratio between the spared cortex in the infarcted hemisphere and the total cortex of the contralateral hemisphere by means of a serological method based on the Cavalieri principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of cortex that was infarcted in control rats was 63.8 +/- 3.1%, whereas nimodipine-treated rats exhibited a significantly smaller (P &lt; .005) percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (31.3 +/- 12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the intra-arterial injection of nimodipine just before and during reperfusion reduced neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats subjected to partially reversible focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
