<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the neuronal response to ischemic injury following exposure to whole brain proton irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain only proton irradiation (8 Gy, 250 MeV) was performed ten days prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in 1 year old male Sprague Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced in two animal groups: proton irradiated (MCAO + Rad) and MCAO only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative analysis were performed prior to and 2 days after irradiation, and then 2, 14 and 28 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the last imaging time point animals were sacrificed and TUNEL staining was performed on 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> - fixed brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuroimaging demonstrated a reduction in ischemic lesion volume in the MCAO + Rad group compared with MCAO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was a 34% decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in MCAO + Rad brains compared to MCAO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that radiation treatment reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, ischemic lesion volume and peri-ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms are currently unknown and additional studies will elucidate the significance of these results </plain></SENT>
