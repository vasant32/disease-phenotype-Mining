<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether combining caffeinol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is safe and feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were treated with caffeinol (<z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> 8-9 mg/kg + <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> 0.4 g/kg intravenously [IV] x 2 hours, started by 4 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (started by 5 hours and continued for 24 hours [target temperature 33-35 degrees C] followed by 12 hours of rewarming) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IV t-PA was given to eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meperidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3223">buspirone</z:chebi> were used to suppress shivering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received caffeinol, and most reached target blood levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cooling was attempted in 18 patients via endovascular (n = 8) or surface (n = 10) approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were not cooled due to catheter or machine failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients reached target temperature; average time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 9 hours and 43 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The last 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> patients received surface cooling with iced saline induction and larger doses of meperidine; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients reached target temperature, on average within 2 hours and 30 minutes from induction and 6 hours and 21 minutes from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients died: one from symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, one from malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, and one from unrelated medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No adverse events were attributed to caffeinol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had reduced respiratory drive due to meperidine, requiring BiPAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Combining caffeinol with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> given IV t-PA is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A prospective placebo-controlled randomized study is needed to further assess safety and to test the efficacy of caffeinol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
