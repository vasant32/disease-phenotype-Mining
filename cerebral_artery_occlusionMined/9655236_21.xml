<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present experiments were undertaken to define changes in tissue calcium metabolism in focal and perifocal ("penumbral") tissues following 2 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats, induced with an intraluminal filament occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extracellular calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]e) was measured with ion-selective microelectrodes in neocortical focus and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For measurement of total tissue calcium content, tissue samples from these areas were collected and analyzed with atomic absorption spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During MCAO, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]e in a neocortical focal area fell from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value of about 1.2 mM to values around 0.1 mM, suggesting translocation of virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extracellular calcium to intracellular fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recirculation was accompanied by re-extrusion of calcium within 5-7 min; however, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]e never returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but stabilized at about 50% of the control value for the first 6 h, and decreased further after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In penumbral areas, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]e showed the expected transient decreases associated with spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like (or ischemic) depolarization waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recirculation was followed by return of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]e towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the focus, water content increased from about 79% to about 80.4% at the end of the 2-h period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 2 h and 4 h of recirculation, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was aggravated (mean values 81.9% and 81.2%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 6 h and 24 h, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was more pronounced (83.6% and 83.8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra, no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was observed until 6 h and 24 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total tissue calcium content in the focus (expressed by unit dry weight) increased at the end of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> period demonstrating calcium translocation from blood to tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 6 h and 24 h, the content increased two- to threefold, compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Changes in the penumbra were qualitatively similar but less pronounced, and a significant increase was not observed until after 6 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that 2 h of MCAO leads to a profound perturbation of cell calcium metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In focal areas, cells fail to extrude the calcium that is gradually accumulated during reperfusion and show massive calcium overload after the first 4-6 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Penumbral tissues show a similar increase in calcium concentration after 6 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
