<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Migration of the transplanted cells to the infarcted area was further confirmed by histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the hMSCs transplanted in MCAo models possess the capacity to migrate to the infarcted area extensively in both ipsilateral and contralateral injections, exhibiting a pathotropism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the detailed migration patterns of transplanted hMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the extensive migratory ability of hMSCs may represent a therapeutic potential for developing efficient cell transplantation strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
