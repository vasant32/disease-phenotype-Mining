<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> activates the residual functions of cholinergic neurons in damaged brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> on bladder overactivity after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were assessed through oral or i.c.v. administration in sham-operated and cerebral infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> (100 and 300 mg/kg) resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats but had no effect on bladder capacity in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> (0.25 and 2.5 microg/rat) resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats but not in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">Aniracetam</z:chebi> had no significant effect on bladder contraction pressure or micturition threshold pressure in either sham-operated or cerebral infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, i.c.v. administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (1 microg/rat), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48876">muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist</z:chebi>, completely inhibited the enhancing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> on bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> on bladder overactivity are thought to be mediated in part by activation of cholinergic inhibitory mechanisms in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47943">aniracetam</z:chebi> may improve the neurogenic voiding dysfunction observed in patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
