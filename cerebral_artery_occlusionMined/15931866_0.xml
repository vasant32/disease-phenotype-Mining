<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under ketamine or ketamine-midazolam intraperitoneal anesthesia (n = 15 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological scoring was performed to determine functional impairment of the brain at 4 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TTC staining of brain slices was used to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size of the brain at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 3 after MCAO, TUNEL staining was employed to detect apoptotic cells in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although neurological scoring (1.57 +/- 0.65 vs 1.74 +/- 0.52) was not significantly different between ketamine and ketamine-midazolam groups (P &gt; 0.05), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and apoptotic cell density in the penumbra were significantly lower in the ketamine-midazolaml group than those in the ketaminel group [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size: (24.1 +/- 4.63)% vs (38.48 +/- 4.18)%; apoptotic cells density: (178 +/- 23) cells/mm2 vs (258 +/- 15) cells/mm2, P &lt; 0.05], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The above findings suggested that ketamine and midazolam combination might provide neuroprotection during surgical procedures that pose risk for ischemic cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
