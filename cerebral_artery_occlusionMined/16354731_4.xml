<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of Kir6.2-containing KATP channel in hippocampus and neocortex has not been tested directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To delineate the physiological roles of Kir6.2 channels in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, we used knockout (KO) mice that do not express Kir6.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that Kir6.2 protein was expressed robustly in hippocampal neurons of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice and absent in the KO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine neuronal sensitivity to metabolic stress in vitro, and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo, we 1) exposed hippocampal slices to transient oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and 2) produced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both slice and whole animal studies showed that neurons from the KO mice were severely damaged after <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas few injured neurons were observed in the WT, suggesting that Kir6.2 channels are necessary to protect neurons from ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Membrane potential recordings from the WT CA1 pyramidal neurons showed a biphasic response to OGD; a brief hyperpolarization was followed by a small depolarization during OGD, with complete recovery within 30 min after returning to normoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, CA1 pyramidal neurons from the KO mice were irreversibly depolarized by OGD exposure, without any preceding hyperpolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that expression of Kir6.2 channels prevents prolonged depolarization of neurons resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoxic or ischemic insults, and thus protects these central neurons from the injury </plain></SENT>
