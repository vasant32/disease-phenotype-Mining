<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a 30-min occlusion period, reperfusion was performed and the vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg x 2) was intraperitoneally administered to each animal model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty eight hours after reperfusion, infarction volume in the 1 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A group was significantly less than that seen in the vehicle group, although, in the high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A group, infarction volumes were significantly higher than those seen in the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A shows not only anti-ischemic effects, but also neurotoxic effects depending on the dosage penetrating into the brain </plain></SENT>
