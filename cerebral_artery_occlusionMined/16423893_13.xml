<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many potentially neuroprotective agents have been investigated, the simplicity of their protective mechanisms has often resulted in insufficient clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a previously uncharacterized class of potent neuroprotective compounds, represented by <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>-811, that effectively block both ischemic and hypoxic neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>-811 disrupts neurotoxic pathways by at least two modes of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It causes a reduction of intracellular-free calcium as well as free radical scavenging resulting in a significant decrease in necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, administration of <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>-811 i.c.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a 59% reduction in the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human trials of <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>-811 for an unrelated indication have established a favorable safety and pharmacodynamic profile within the dose range required for neuroprotection warranting its clinical trial as a neuroprotective drug </plain></SENT>
