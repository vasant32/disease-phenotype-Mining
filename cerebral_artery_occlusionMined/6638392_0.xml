<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> after rupture, these values were significantly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, these values were similar to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that Doppler ultrasound assessment of internal carotid flow velocity provides noninvasive reliable information for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in childhood </plain></SENT>
