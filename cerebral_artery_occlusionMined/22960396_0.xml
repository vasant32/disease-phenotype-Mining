<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here the correlativity between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>, a representative pollutant of vehicle exhaust, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was first determined under experimental conditions following some epidemiological reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, we found that blood viscosity, red blood cell (RBC) aggregation-, electrophoresis- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>-index in healthy rats were increased after exposure to 5mg/m(3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> for one- and three-month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this, we set up <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat model and exposed them to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> at the same concentration for one week, and found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> exposure time-dependently delayed neurological structure and function recovery of MCAO (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) rat, and worsened pathological injuries and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by MCAO operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, two common cellular pathomechanisms involved in ischemic brain damage, were induced in cortex by MCAO treatment and exacerbated by followed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> displayed the same tendency in healthy rats after sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> exposure as in MCAO model in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence that environmental <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi> is an important inducer, and also a promoter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, with endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM-1) being potential indicators of this effect </plain></SENT>
