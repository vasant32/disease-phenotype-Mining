<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined twenty-five patients with a moderately ischemic area determined using pretreatment <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99mTc-HMPAO) SPET, and with complete recanalization within 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET studies, consisting of scanning for 0.5-6.5 min (early scan) and 15-21 min (delayed scan) after tracer injection, were performed immediately after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of the affected area outlined on pretreatment 99mTc-HMPAO SPET was used for the post-treatment early and delayed 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET images, and the AR/CE ratio (ratio of affected regional activity to cerebellar activity) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The washout index of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> in the affected area was also calculated by dividing the difference between the AR/CE ratio in the early and delayed images by the AR/CE ratio in the early image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients without infarction or with small subcortical/basal ganglial infarction, ten with medium or large cortical infarction, and three with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were identified by follow-up computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the AR/CE ratio in post-treatment early 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET images was significantly higher in the hemorrhagic group than in the cortical infarction group, this value did not differentiate the reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group from either the cortical infarction or the hemorrhagic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AR/CE ratio in post-treatment delayed 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET images statistically differentiated the reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group from both the cortical infarction and the hemorrhagic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the difference between the cortical infarction and hemorrhagic groups was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The washout index of 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> statistically differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that a combination of early and delayed 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET imaging performed immediately after thrombolysis predicts ischemic tissue outcome </plain></SENT>
