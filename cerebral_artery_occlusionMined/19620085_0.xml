<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of EEG approximate entropy (ApEn) in rats during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into infarction group (n=12) with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and sham-operated group (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EEG data (ApEn) was recorded in the bilateral areas (C3, C4) of the rats with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> before the infarction and immediately and at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same measurement was carried out in the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the sham-operated group, ApEn in C3 and C4 showed no obvious differences at the time points (P&gt;0.05), but in the infarction group, ApEn in C3 and C4 increased significantly after the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApEn in the ischemic area (C4) was significantly lower than that in the non-ischemic area (C3) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bilateral ApEn decreased with the passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ApEn in the ischemic area (C4) was significantly lowered at 30 min after the infarction in comparison with that before infarction (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the sham-operated group, ApEn showed no significant difference between C3 and C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ApEn was comparable between the two groups before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ApEn can help monitor the occurrence of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of rats, and may be used to assess the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after infarction </plain></SENT>
