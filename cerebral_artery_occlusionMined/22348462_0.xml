<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the hypothesis that S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30361">allyl</z:chebi> cysteine (SAC), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33261">organosulfur compounds</z:chebi> found in garlic extract, would reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-associated brain injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO for 2 hours and 22-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30361">allyl</z:chebi> cysteine was administered (100 mg/kg, b.wt.) intraperitoneally 30 minutes before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at the interval of 0, 6, and 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of reperfusion, rats were tested for neurobehavioral activities and were killed for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, estimation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> content, and activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase, catalase, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30361">allyl</z:chebi> cysteine treatment significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume, improved neurologic deficits, combated oxidative loads, and suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral and biochemical alterations observed after MCAO were further associated with an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> expression and were markedly inhibited by the treatment with SAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that SAC exhibits exuberant neuroprotective potential in rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, this finding of SAC-induced adaptation to ischemic stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could suggest a novel avenue for clinical intervention during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
