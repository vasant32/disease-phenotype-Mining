<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cytokines, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and stem cell factor (SCF) were reported to show a neuroprotective effect or to support neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cytokines also mobilize bone marrow (BM) cells into the brain, and the BM-derived cells differentiate into neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We administered these hematopoietic cytokines after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and assessed their effects and the therapeutic time window for neuronal regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We induced permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice whose BM had been replaced with BM cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occluded mice were treated with G-CSF and SCF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (days 1 to 10) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (days 11 to 20), and the brain functions and histological changes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separately, we injected bromodeoxyuridine during cytokine treatment to assess cell kinetics in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six mice were prepared for each experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of G-CSF and SCF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase effectively improved not only motor performance but also higher brain function, compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo>-phase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo>-phase treatments identically reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume relative to vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo>-phase treatment significantly induced transition of BM-derived neuronal cells into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and stimulated proliferation of intrinsic neural stem/progenitor cells in the neuroproliferative zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of G-CSF and SCF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is effective for functional recovery, enhancing cytokine-induced generation of neuronal cells from both BM-derived cells and intrinsic neural stem/progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because G-CSF and SCF are available for clinical use, these findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
