<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (HG) is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume expansion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, collateral circulation can sustain the ischaemic penumbra and limit the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the association between HG and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume expansion is dependent on collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 93 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HG was diagnosed in patients with an admitting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value ≥140 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic collateral grade 0-1 was designated as poor collateral circulation and grade 2-4 as good collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at admission and at again within 7 days using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 34 patients with poor collateral grade, the change in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly greater in the HG group than in the non-HG group (106.0 ml vs. 22.7 ml, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 59 patients with good collateral circulation, the change in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was greater in the HG group than in the non-HG group (53.3 ml vs. 10.9 ml, P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis indicated that admission HG (P = 0.004), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (P = 0.018), and poor collateral circulation (P = 0.040) were independently associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume expansion was greater in individuals with HG on admission regardless of collateral circulation status </plain></SENT>
