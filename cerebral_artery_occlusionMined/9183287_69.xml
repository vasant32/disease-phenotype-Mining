<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vivo, BDNF rescues motorneurons, hippocampal, and substantia nigral dopaminergic cells from traumatic and toxic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), upregulation of BDNF-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cortical neurons suggests that BDNF potentially plays a neuroprotective role in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, BDNF (2.1 micrograms/d) in vehicle or vehicle alone (controls) was delivered intraventricularly for 8 days, beginning 24 hours before permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by intraluminal suture in Wistar rats (n = 13 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in physiological variables recorded during surgery for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit (0 to 4 scale), which was assessed on a daily basis, improved in BDNF-treated animals compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05; analysis of variance and Scheffe's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in weight in BDNF-treated animals and controls during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After elective killing on day 7 after MCAO, brains underwent 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining for calculation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and for histology (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and glial fibrillary acid protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 83.1 +/- 27.1 mm3 in BDNF-treated animals and 139.2 +/- 56.4 mm3 in controls (mean +/- SD; P &lt; 0.01, unpaired, two-tailed t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 10.8 +/- 7.1 mm3 in BDNF-treated animals and 37.9 +/- 19.8 mm3 in controls (mean +/- SD; P &lt; 0.05; unpaired, two-tailed t-test), whereas ischemic lesion volume in caudoputaminal infarction was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that pretreatment with intraventricular BDNF reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and support the hypothesis of a neuroprotective role for BDNF in stoke </plain></SENT>
