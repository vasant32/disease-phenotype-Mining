<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The negative regulator of p53 transactivation, Mdm2, increased in the ischemic territory after 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased mdm2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction by 6 hours of reperfusion in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to localize increases in mdm2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which occurred in neurons of ischemic cortex and dorsolateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of labeled neurons increased by approximately 20-fold and the cells displayed five-fold increases of mdm2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for Mdm2 revealed that its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was efficiently translated in the ischemic cortex, but not striatum, by 8 to 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting confirmed 30- to 40-fold increases in the full-length protein of 90 kd at these time points without evidence of alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because Mdm2 is a negative regulator of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> promoting activity of p53, increased expression of Mdm2 may be a component of a repair response in injured neurons, and supports Mdm2 being an indicator of DNA damage in the brain early after an ischemic insult in a similar way to Gadd45 </plain></SENT>
