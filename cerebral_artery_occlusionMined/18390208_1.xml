<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of dl-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) on the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in rats brain with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of permanent MCAO was established by using the suture method of Longa, with which the nylon suture was used to make rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated rats (n=20) were prepared in similar fashion, but without doing the closed occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operated rats were randomizely divided into model control and NBP groups (n= 20 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By intragastric administration, sham-operated and model control group rats were given vegetable oil 2 mL twice daily for 3 days, and also NBP group rats were given NBP 25 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit scores were determined by tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and Longa's score separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of VEGF and bFGF were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NBP markedly inhibited the neurological deficit and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes as compared to model control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NBP significantly upregulated VEGF and bFGF expression in both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the peripheral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and hippocampus regions in contrast with sham-operated and model control groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of VEGF and bFGF did not show significantly any difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBP can significantly reduce neurological deficit and infarction volume, and therefore may have protective effect for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through upregulating the expression of VEGF and bFGF </plain></SENT>
