<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral I/R injury model was reproduced by intraluminal silk ligature <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided randomly into sham control and I/R groups in young rats [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 3 hours (I 3 h) and reperfusion 6 hours (I/R 6 h), 12 hours (I/R 12 h), 24 hours (I/R 24 h), 3 days (I/R 3 d), 6 days (I/R 6 d)], and sham control group and I/R group in aged rats (I 3 h and I/R 6 h, I/R 12 h, I/R 24 h , I/R 3 d, I/R 6 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change in cerebro-cortex microvessel basement membrane structure, basement membrane type IV collagen (Col IV) and laminin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) contents, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) expression in every group were determined with immunohistochemical method and zymogram analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the increase in age, Col IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> contents of the microvessel basement membrane were increased, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were stronger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With prolongation of I/R, the degradation of microvessel basement membrane components (Col IV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) was positively correlated with the duration of cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 expression was increased gradually, and MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression increased at the beginning and decreased subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Col IV(I 3 h, I/R 6 h , I/R 12 h), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (I 3 h, I/R 6-24 h), MMP-2 (I 3 h, I/R 6 h-6 d) and MMP-9 (I 3 h, I/R 6-24 h) expression level in aged rats with I/R injury were higher, and TIMP-1 (I/R 24 h) expression was lower than those in young rats (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, changes in MMP-2 and MMP-9 contents as determined by zymogram analysis method coincided with their immunoexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the increase of age, alteration in membrane components of cerebro-microvessel basement membrane in rats is related with MMPs and TIMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebro-microvessel basement membrane injury is more serious in aged rats than that of young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in cerebro-microvessel basement membrane injury in aged rats is related with gelatinase system change </plain></SENT>
