<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we observed that BAG1 expression is induced during neuronal differentiation in the developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the in vivo effects of BAG1 during development and after maturation of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system have never been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated transgenic mice over-expressing BAG1 in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While brain development was essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, cultured cortical neurons from transgenic animals exhibited resistance to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced, apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in an in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model involving transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, BAG1 transgenic mice demonstrated decreased mortality and substantially reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, brain tissue from BAG1 transgenic mice contained higher levels of neuroprotective Hsp70/Hsc70 protein but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting a potential mechanism whereby BAG1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, BAG1 displays potent neuroprotective activity in vivo against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and therefore represents an interesting target for developing new therapeutic strategies including gene therapy and small-molecule drugs for reducing brain injury during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
