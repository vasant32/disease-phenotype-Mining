<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were subjected to 2 h of MCAO followed by 22 h reperfusion after which the grip strength, locomotor activity and spontaneous alternation performance were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were then killed and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers were estimated in the whole brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) and a reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), was observed following MCAO, the last two being statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> (5.5 mg/kg i.p. and 11 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reversed the MCAO-induced increase in TBARS, but could not reverse the other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, it further reduced the levels of GPx, GR and SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in the catalase levels and in the grip strength and spontaneous alternation behavior of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Locomotor activity was reduced slightly, but reversed on pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dual effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> requires further investigation and raises doubts on its possible use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
