<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of neuronal damage was determined by 45Ca autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of 45Ca was observed in the corpus callosum and ipsilateral cerebral cortex immediately following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of occlusion, 45Ca had accumulated in the ipsilateral pyramidal tract, the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the lateral portion of the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant accumulation of 45Ca was observed in the same areas after 7 and 14 days of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next the effect of MK-801 on accumulation of 45Ca after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was examined using the same technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (0.5-10 mg/kg i.v.) or saline was administered 15 min before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and volumes of accumulation of 45Ca were calculated 1 week after ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MK-801 significantly reduced 45Ca uptake in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a strong statistical correlation between the volume of accumulation of 45Ca in the cortex and that in the thalamus (r = 0.8974; p &lt; 0.001; n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculate that delayed neuronal damage in the corpus callosum, ipsilateral pyramidal tract, and thalamus may be caused by secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, neuronal damage in the striatum, a segment not supplied by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, may be related to excessive release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
