<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous findings suggest that the proper regulation and subcellular localization of iron are very important in brain cell function and viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain iron dyshomeostasis is observed during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging, as well as in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's diseases</z:e>, coincident with areas more susceptible to insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of their high metabolic demand and electrical excitability, neurons are particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore set out to look for abnormalities in the brain of young adult mice that lack Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that iron levels in the striatum and cerebral cortex of these young animals are significantly lower than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the neurotrophin brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known for its role in maintenance of cell viability, were decreased in these brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">Chelator</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of iron in cultured neural cells resulted in reduced BDNF expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism, suggesting a causal link between low brain iron levels and reduced BDNF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we found increased brain damage in Cp-deficient mice compared to WT controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that lack of Cp increases neuronal susceptibility to ischemic injury by a mechanism that may involve reduced levels of iron and BDNF </plain></SENT>
