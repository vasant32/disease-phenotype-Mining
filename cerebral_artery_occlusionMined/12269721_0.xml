<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> is beneficial to the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by transient Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological change and DNA damage degree were detected by H&amp;E staining and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> and EA combination group could significantly decrease the percentages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and cell loss induced by ischemic injury in the striatum (p&lt;0.05, vs singly treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> or EA), and also the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was smaller than both singly treated groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunoreactivities detection of Bcl-2 (which promotes cell survival), Bax (which promotes cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and P53 (product of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene p53) showed that the combination group apparently attenuated P53 immunoreactivities expression whereas augmented the immunoreactivities expression ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax in cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that combining use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> and EA could exert better neuroprotective effects, which might be related to the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway </plain></SENT>
