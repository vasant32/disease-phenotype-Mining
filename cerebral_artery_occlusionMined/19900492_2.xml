<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the effects of CGRP on gastrointestinal injuries induced by cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) on gastric mucosa injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats were selected for this experiment and were randomly divided into CGRP-treated, sham-operated, and control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten rats were involved in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion rat model was established by a 2-hour left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using an intraluminal filament, followed by 46h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CGRP (1 microg/ml) at the dose of 3 microg/kg was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in CGRP-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Saline as vehicle (3 ml/kg body weight), i.p., was administered at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals were subjected to an operation without MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after operation, the samples were taken out and processed for calculating stomach mucous membrane damage index according to Guth method, detecting pathological changes of gastric mucosa tissue by light microscopy, determining mast cell distribution by toluidine blue staining, and observing the expression of gastrin (Gas), somatostatin (SST), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that: (1) Gastric mucosa with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, splinter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, numerous endothelial cells <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, mucosa dissociation, infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in both control and CGRP-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CGRP administration could reduce the damage of gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The injury index of gastric mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group as compared with that in control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(2) Gas expression in gastric antrum mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SST expression in gastric antrum mucosa was higher in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>AQP4 expression in gastric mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>bFGF expression in gastric mucosa was higher in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(3) The mast cell degranulation ratio in control group in gastric mucosa was significantly higher than that in CGRP-treated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CGRP can regulate the secretion of Gas, SST, AQP(4), and bFGF, inhibit mast cell degaranulation and thus alleviate the damage of gastric mucosa induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CGRP may be one of the good candidates of potential clinical therapy drugs for regulating gastric mucosal protection and maintaining gastric mucosal integrity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
