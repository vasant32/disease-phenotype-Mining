<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of memantine on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and on neurological outcome after temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, performed between 2002-2004 in Dicle University School of Medicine, Diyarbakir, Turkey, 30 adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was constituted by the intraluminal filament method with a 4-0 nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was started after 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly divided into 2 groups as control and memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saline 0.9% (0.5 ml/kg) and memantine (30 mg/kg) were administered via nasogastric intubations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three coronal slices of 2 mm thickness were obtained from cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem, and were stained with a 2% solution of triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transparent sheets were placed over each section and the areas of the brain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five slices from each group (total 90) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percent of ischemic area (%) in cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem level in memantine was lower than those of the control group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined an improvement in neurological score at 24th and 72nd hours in the rats that have been given memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The memantine group showed significantly better recovery than the control group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that memantine may decrease ischemic area in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and it seems that memantine may be beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
