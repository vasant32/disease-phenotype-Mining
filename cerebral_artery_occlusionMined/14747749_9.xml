<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies of gene expression changes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can provide novel insight into ischemic pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe application of restriction-mediated differential display to screening for differentially expressed genes after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method combines the nonredundant generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-labeled fragment sets with the excellent resolution of direct blotting electrophoresis, reliable fragment recovery, and a novel clone selection strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the filament model in mouse with 90 minutes <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by 2, 6, and 20 hours reperfusion, we have compared gene expression in sham-operated animals to both the ipsi- and contralateral forebrain hemisphere of ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our screening method has resulted in the identification of 70 genes differentially regulated after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), several of which represent unknown clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have identified many of the previously published regulated genes, lending high credibility to our method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we detected a high degree of correspondent regulation of genes in the nonischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of genes coding for proteins in the respiratory chain was found to be up-regulated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, potentially representing a new mechanism involved in counteracting energy failure or radical generation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One particularly interesting gene, whose upregulation by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has not been described before, is pip92; this gene shows a rapid and long-lasting induction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that pip92 induces cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in primary neurons and displays several hallmarks of pro-apoptotic activity upon overexpression, supporting the notion that we have identified a novel pathophysiological player in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, restriction-mediated differential display has proven its suitability for screening complex samples such as brain to reliably identify regulated genes, which can uncover novel pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
