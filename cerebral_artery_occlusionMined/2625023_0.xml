<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and one patients with embolic (EM) and 107 with thrombotic (TH) cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> of the internal carotid arterial system were subjected to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of EM and TH were made with our own diagnostic criteria, based on clinical and angiographic informations but not on CT findings, as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Well-marginated hypodense areas in multiple vascular territories were observed only in patients with EM (13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following CT findings were more frequently seen in EM than in TH; a) a hypodense area involving the cortex, b) a sharply-marginated lesion, c) a shift of the mid-line structures and d) hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with TH were more frequently accompanied with watershed infarction, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia and/or deep white matter than those with EM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Watershed zone between cortical and perforating arteries was involved only by TH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deep-seated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, however, was more likely to be embolic rather than thrombotic in nature, if it was sharply-marginated and accompanied with surrounding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in CT findings of EM and TH appeared to reflect those of pathogenetic mechanisms such as rapidity of occlusive process, sites of occlusion, routes and availabilities of collateral circulation, presence of reopening of the previously occluded artery, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study, it can be concluded that there is distinctive differences in CT findings between EM and TH, indicating the usefulness in differentiation of two diagnostic subtypes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
