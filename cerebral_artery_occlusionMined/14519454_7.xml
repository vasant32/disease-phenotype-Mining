<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effects of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in marmoset monkeys over 5 months, using behavioural and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three marmosets were trained on behavioural tests before pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Shortly after surgery, these marmosets were scanned with T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three, 10 and 20 weeks after surgery, these marmosets were re-tested on the behavioural tasks and had further MRI sessions to monitor lesion development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was followed by histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these marmosets had a persistent contralesional motor deficit and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> which resolved over the 20 weeks of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume assessed by MRI on the day of surgery and at 20 weeks matched the percentage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured histologically at 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the apparent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 3 weeks was considerably less than that measured by histological analysis or that measured at the other MRI time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional histological analysis of the brains of two further marmosets removed 3 weeks after pMCAO found considerable infiltration by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> filled macrophages into the ischaemic zone which may have caused an MRI "fogging" effect leading to an apparent reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
