<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to characterize the initial and secondary changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water with high temporal resolution measurements of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and to correlate <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes with functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen rats underwent 30 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T2-weighted imaging was performed during MCAO and every 30 minutes for a total of 12 hours after reperfusion (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcomes were evaluated during MCAO, every 30 minutes for a total of 6 hours and at 24 hours after reperfusion (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decreased cerebral blood flow during MCAO returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after reperfusion and remained unchanged thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values during occlusion completely recovered at 1 hour after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The renormalized <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values started to decrease secondarily at 2.5 hours, accompanied by a delayed increase in T2 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-defined secondary lesion grew over time and was 52% of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-defined initial lesion at 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation demonstrated neuronal damage in the regions of secondary <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete resolution of neurological deficits was seen in 1 rat at 1 hour and in 6 rats between 2.5 and 6 hours after reperfusion; no secondary neurological deficits were observed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that (1) a secondary <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction occurs as early as 2.5 hours after reperfusion, evolves in a slow fashion, and is associated with neuronal injury; and (2) renormalization and secondary decline in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> are not associated with neurological recovery and worsening, respectively </plain></SENT>
