<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of low intensity (8 mT) PMF on functional recovery and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue volume was assessed in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received a combination of PMF protocols, including high and low frequencies and recovery was monitored over eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMF treatment had no effect on functional recovery or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarcted tissue accounted for â‰ˆ8% of total brain volume, encompassing both cortical and subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The microglial and astrocytic response to PMF treatment was monitored and there was no change in glial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, however there was increased macrophage infiltration in animals that received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> high (6-9 Hz) and low (1 Hz) stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no effect of PMF on the degree of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> observed within the ischemic core, with no TUNEL positive cells observed in the non-infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No detrimental side-effects of PMF were observed, indicating that low-intensity PMF may have limited safety concerns for future human and animal studies </plain></SENT>
