<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, new axonal connections were formed from the contralesional cortex to subcortical areas corresponding to the observed functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether dendritic changes, also known to subserve functional recovery, paralleled the axonal plasticity shown after ischemic lesion and treatment with mAb IN-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Golgi-Cox-stained layer V pyramidal neurons in the contralesional sensorimotor cortex were examined for evidence of dendritic sprouting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated increased dendritic arborization and spine density in the mAb IN-1-treated animals with lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, administration of mAb IN-1 without lesion resulted in transient dendritic outgrowth with no change in spine density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a novel role for Nogo-A in limiting dendritic plasticity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
