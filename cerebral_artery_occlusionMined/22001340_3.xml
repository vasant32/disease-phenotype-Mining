<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polydatin has been proved to elicit numerous biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regard to the mechanism of polydatin's neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of polydatin and explored the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>-associated oncogene homolog1 (Gli1), Patched-1 (Ptch1) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase 1 (SOD1) after pMCAO, six time points were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 was used to detect polydatin's neuroprotection after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were measured at 24h and 72 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western Blotting, activity assay and confocal microscope were used to analyse the expression of Gli1, Ptch1, SOD1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experiment 3 was used to detect polydatin's influence on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with Sham group, the expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 were up-regulated shortly after pMCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with Vehicle group, high dose of polydatin (50mg/kg) up-regulated Gli1, Ptch1, SOD1 and down-regulated NF-κB, and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, brain water content and behavioral deficits (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was also ameliorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that polydatin protected the brain from damage caused by pMCAO, and this effect may be through up-regulating the expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 and down-regulating the expression of NF-κB, and ameliorating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
