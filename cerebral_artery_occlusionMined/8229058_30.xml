<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n = 61) were subjected to 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion induced by advancing a nylon monofilament into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed after different durations of reperfusion, ranging from 4 to 166 h (n = 6-11 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal injury and astrocytic reaction were evaluated using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H &amp; E) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eosinophilic neurons were detected at 4 h of reperfusion in the basal ganglia, and at 10 h of reperfusion in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> developed by 46 h of reperfusion, both in the cortex and the basal ganglia, and the volume remained constant between 46 and 166 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in astrocytic reaction were detected between the lesion and the periphery of the lesion at reperfusion times from 46 to 166 h; GFAP staining decreased in the core of the lesion and increased in the peripheral areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that, after 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, brain tissue progresses from isolated neuronal injury to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with a time course dependent on anatomical site; and astrocytic reactivity, expressed by GFAP staining, reflects the outcome of the ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
