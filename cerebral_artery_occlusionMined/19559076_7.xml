<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups as IN low (100 microg/ml), IN middle (200 microg/ml) and IN high (500 microg/ml) VEGF-treated group, and IN saline-treated group (n=12), given recombinant human VEGF 165 or saline intranasally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by transient (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral neurological deficits were assessed 1, 7 and 14 d after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 14 d, the brain sections were stained and an image analysis system was used to calculate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microvessels were labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and the segment lengths, diameters and number of microvessels were measured by Image Pro-Plus Version 6.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days post MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01) in rats which received the middle dose of IN VEGF when compared to IN saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And middle dose of VEGF significantly improved behavioral recovery (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the behavioral recovery and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed between the saline-treated group and the low or high VEGF-treated groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to IN saline, middle and high doses of VEGF significantly increased the segment length, diameter and number of microvessels (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the segment length, diameter and number of microvessels was observed between the IN saline-treated group and the low VEGF-treated group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The middle dose of IN VEGF was most effective on reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improving behavioral recovery and enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain, which can be used in the following treatments to further evaluate the effect of VEGF </plain></SENT>
