<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Appropriate and efficacious use of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> in rodents must be balanced judiciously between animal needs and research objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A concern in many studies is that <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> will confound experimental outcome or interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, determining whether rats subjected to surgical protocols show evidence of pain is important if we are to provide rational postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> without compromising experimental objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate both subjective and objective measures for pain evaluation in male Wistar rats subjected to sham middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) surgery and to determine whether buprenorphine would be an appropriate <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> in this surgical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats underwent a sham 2-h MCAO by the intraluminal filament technique followed by 22-h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to one of three postoperative treatment groups: vehicle only (VH; vehicle subcutaneously [s.c.] + plain jello orally), low-dose buprenorphine (LB; 0.05 mg/kg s.c. _ 0.25 mg/kg drug-in-jello orally), and high-dose buprenorphine (HB; 0.5 mg/kg s.c. + 0.25 mg/kg drug-in-jello orally) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals received subcutaneous treatments prior to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> recovery and approximately 18-h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Jello treatments were given once at the end of the surgery day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We modified a previously published behavioral scoring system which is based on subjective and objective measures for pain evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were evaluated for pain before sham surgery (baseline) and at 3-, 18-, and 22-h postoperatively by observers who were blinded to treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed at 22-h after surgery and evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining to confirm lack of brain injury from the sham procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sham intraoperative physiological variables were equivalent among treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline assessment scores were zero for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups showed elevated assessment scores relative to baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Buprenorphine at the tested doses did not markedly reduce total assessment scores postoperatively relative to those in vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of rodent postoperative pain and response to <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> is needed if we are to formulate a sound scientific approach to animal management in protocols requiring surgical manipulations </plain></SENT>
