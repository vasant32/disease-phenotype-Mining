<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) and were intravenously administered hUTC (N = 11) or vehicle (N = 10) 48 hrs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White matter and vascular reorganization was monitored over a 12-week period using MRI and histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI results were correlated with neurological functional and histology outcomes to demonstrate that MRI can be a useful tool to measure structural recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a significant reduction in the ventricular volume expansion and improvement in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the hUTC treated group compared to vehicle treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with hUTC resulted in histological and functional improvements as evidenced by enhanced expression of vWF and synaptophysin, and improved outcomes on behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were detected between MRI ventricular volumes and histological lesion volume as well as number of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was also observed between MRI CBF or cerebral blood volume (CBV) and histological synaptic density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional tests were also significantly correlated with MRI ventricular volume and CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that MRI measurements can detect the effect of hUTC therapy on the brain reorganization and exhibited positive correlation with histological measurements of brain structural changes and functional behavioral tests after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI ventricular volumes provided the most sensitive index in monitoring brain remodeling and treatment effects and highly correlated with histological and functional measurements </plain></SENT>
