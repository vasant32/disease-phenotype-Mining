<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism and clinical implications of this sign have not yet been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The features of HV and its relevance to other imaging factors are presented here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prominence and location of HV were documented in 52 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory infarction, before treatment with IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment ischemic lesion volume, perfusion lesion volume, and vessel occlusion were determined in addition to recanalization status and ischemic lesion volume on follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was used as a measure of clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HV distal to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was observed in 73% of patients; more frequent in proximal than distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, initial perfusion lesion volume was comparable among patients with different grade distal HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with more prominent distal HV had smaller initial, 24-hour, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion volumes and lower initial NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of distal hyperintense vessels before thrombolytic treatment is associated with large diffusion-perfusion mismatch and smaller <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion volumes in patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
