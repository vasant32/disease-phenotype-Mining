<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebral injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was determined in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats (n = 32) after 180 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 120 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the following was employed during the occlusion period only: 1) control, mean arterial pressure [MAP = 131 +/- 7 (SD) mmHg] and hematocrit (43 +/- 2%) were not manipulated; 2) hemodilution, the hematocrit was reduced to 30% with 5% albumin (MAP = 104 +/- 19 mmHg); 3) hemodilution-normotension, hemodilution was established, and MAP was maintained at 131 +/- 9 mmHg with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>; 4) hemodilution-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hemodilution was established, and MAP increased to 161 +/- 2 mmHg with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain injury was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was assessed by microgravimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> were less in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> groups, compared with the control and hemodilution groups (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the premise that if normotension is maintained, hemodilution reduces ischemic brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also indicate that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to hemodilution therapy results in a further reduction of ischemic injury without exacerbating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
