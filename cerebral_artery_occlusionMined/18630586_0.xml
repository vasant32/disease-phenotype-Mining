<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cerebral cortex of rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (CI/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were uniformly randomized into sham operation (sham), CI/R and CI/R + EA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI/R model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2/15 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Shuigou" (GV 26) and "Baihui" (GV 20) for 30 min after CI/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the cerebral cortex (fronto-parietal lobes) in each group were detected by flow cytometer (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with sham group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential of CI/R group decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01), while compared with CI/R group, it increased remarkably in CI/R + EA group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CI/R group was significantly higher than that in sham group (P&lt;0.01), and that of CI/R + EA group was significantly lower than that of CI/R group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can alleviate CI/R injury partially by up-regulating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, which may contribute to its effect in reducing cerebral neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
