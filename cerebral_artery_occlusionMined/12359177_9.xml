<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tempol is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29767">nitroxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> with proven protective efficacy in several animal models, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, that has not been previously tested in models of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following dose-response and time-window-finding experiments rats were given vehicle or tempol (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 1 h after PMCAO (n = 10/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five animals in each group were evaluated with a motor scale 24 h after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and were then sacrificed and the injury volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals were examined daily with the motor scale and also with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test on days 26-30 after PMCAO and sacrificed on day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor scores at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points examined were significantly better in the tempol-treated animals (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly better performance in the water maze test for performance on days 26-30 was noted in the tempol group compared with the vehicle-treated group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injury volumes at days 1 and 30 were significantly reduced in the tempol group (9.83 +/- 1.05 vs 19.94 +/- 1.43% hemispheric volume, P = 0.0009, and 13.2 +/- 2.97 vs 24.4 +/- 2.38% hemispheric volume, P = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with tempol led to significant motor and behavioral improvement and reduced injured tissue volumes both in the short and in the long term after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
