<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated how <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> delivery of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, starting at 24 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and continuing for 29 days (4 mg/kg/day; via drinking water), influences neuronal survival, endogenous neurogenesis, motor recovery and locomotor activity in C57Bl6/j mice submitted to 30-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic studies showed that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> improved neuronal survival and enhanced neurogenesis, even when applied 1 day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell survival was associated with a long-lasting improvement of motor and coordination deficits, evaluated by the grip strength and RotaRod tests, as well as with attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> of the animals as revealed in open field tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The robust functional neurologic improvements encourage proof-of-concept studies with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
