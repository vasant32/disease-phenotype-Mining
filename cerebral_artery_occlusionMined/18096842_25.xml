<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether intraarterial (IAT) or intravenous (IVT) thrombolysis is more effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare IAT and IVT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with HMCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comparison of data from 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units with similar management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with HMCAS, except that 1 unit performed IAT with urokinase and the other IVT with plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to treatment was up to 6 hours for IAT and up to 3 hours for IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was measured by mortality and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized at 3 months into favorable (mRS 0 to 2) and unfavorable (mRS 3 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients exhibited a HMCAS, 55 of 268 patients treated with IAT and 57 of 249 patients who underwent IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity at baseline and patient age were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time to treatment was longer in the IAT group (244+/-63 minutes) than in the IVT group (156+/-21 minutes; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, favorable outcome was more frequent after IAT (n=29, 53%) than after IVT (n=13, 23%; P=0.001), and mortality was lower after IAT (n=4, 7%) than after IVT (n=13, 23%; P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After multiple regression analysis IAT was associated with a more favorable outcome than IVT (P=0.003) but similar mortality (P=0.192) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study intraarterial thrombolysis was more beneficial than IVT in the specific group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients presenting with HMCAS on CT, even though IAT was started later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that a randomized trial comparing both thrombolytic treatments in patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is warranted </plain></SENT>
