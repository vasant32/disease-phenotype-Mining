<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown, using a mouse strain transgenic (tg) for the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene, that tg mice have consistently smaller infarcted areas than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) animals, correlated with upregulated NGF synthesis and impaired apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied, in wt and tg mice subjected to MCAO, the activities of several <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and the synthesis of the proteins of the Bcl-2 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase are recruited after MCAO </plain></SENT>
