<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that an aqueous preparation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> did not reach the brain while a liposomal preparation produced measurable cerebral amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> that reduced significantly the cerebral damage provoked by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAo) of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, the protective effects of liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> (LQ) were investigated in the same model after 1 and 4 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LQ was administered in a single dose (30 mg/kg), at 30 min, 1 and 4 h after pMCAo, and the brain was studied 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral damage and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> volume were assessed with a tetrazolium salt (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The status of brain tissue, the neuronal population, the global motor behaviour as well as the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, endogenous reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), were also assessed in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty min after LQ there was a significantly protective effect against ischemic lesion demonstrated by a significant increase in numbers of cells in striatum and cortex, together with a partial reversal of motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GSH levels decreased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in ipsilateral striatum and cortex, and the LQ preparation reversed these effects 24 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that endogenous brain GSH is critical in the defense mechanisms after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as a significant mediator of the protective effects of the LQ preparation </plain></SENT>
