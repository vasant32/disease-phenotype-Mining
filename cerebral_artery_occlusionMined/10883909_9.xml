<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Experimental rat models are often used to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, yet rats are nocturnal animals that have activity cycles that are the opposite of those of humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the following study the authors examined the circadian rhythm of sensitivity to an ischemic insult in rats by using an intraluminal thread technique to produce reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> (2 hours of blockage followed by 22 hours of reperfusion) was induced in rats according to the 24-hour clock at either 100, 400, 700, 1,000, 1,300, 1,600, 1,900, or 2,200 hours (11-14 rats per time period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rat brains were removed, coronally sectioned, stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and analyzed using commercially available software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance and cosinor-rhythmometry statistical tests were used for analysis of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time of day when the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was induced had a significant (p = 0.011) influence on the volume of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of total brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> produced at 400 hours (7.65 +/- 1.31%) was more than three times greater than the volume produced at 1600 hours (2.1 +/- 0.34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cosinor-rhythm analysis indicated a peak occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 6:02 (95% confidence interval 5:49-6:16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> correlated with core body temperature rhythms, which varied by 1.3 +/- 0.62 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythms, as well as the reversed natural body rhythms of the rat compared with humans, should be considered when extrapolating data to human or other animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporal rhythms may also provide information concerning the cascading disease processes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
