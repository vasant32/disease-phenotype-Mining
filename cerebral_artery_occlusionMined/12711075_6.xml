<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We analyze morphological alterations of cerebral neovascularization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using a new 3D imaging software program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent unilateral embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by a single fibrin rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were sacrificed from 1 to 28 days post <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel perimeters were measured on coronal sections stained with endothelial cell-specific antibody to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e>'s factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessel segment lengths, diameters and number of vessels were analyzed on cerebral microvessels perfused with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using LSCM and a 3-D vessel quantification program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of microvessels with enlarged perimeters significantly increased in the ipsilateral cortex at day 7 when compared to the contralateral cortex (29.7+/-14.7 vs. 3.7+/-2.5, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, differences in the number of microvessels with enlarged perimeters decreased on days 14 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, microvessel segment length (15.0 vs. 26.0 microm, P&lt;0.05) and diameter (3.14 vs. 3.75 microm, P&lt;0.05) significantly decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere when compared to the contralateral hemisphere, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mean total number of these smaller microvessels increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere (57.33+/-14.5 vs. 32.22+/-11.7, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces morphological changes (early dilated microvessels followed by decreased microvessel segment length and diameter) that are consistent with newly generated microvessels </plain></SENT>
