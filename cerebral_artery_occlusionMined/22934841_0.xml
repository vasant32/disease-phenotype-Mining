<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a novel synthesized compound (MnTm4PyP) with highly effective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity to study the therapeutic potential of MnSOD and the possible underlying mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary cultured cortical neurons were used to examine the protective effect of the compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were used as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were pretreated with MnTm4PyP intravenously 30 min before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after surgery, neurological behavior and histological function were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarcted cortex tissues and cultured neurons were collected for investigation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed that MnSOD mimic MnTm4PyP pretreatment significantly increased viability of neurons after injury by H(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical levels were eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo experiments demonstrated MnTm4PyP pretreatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
