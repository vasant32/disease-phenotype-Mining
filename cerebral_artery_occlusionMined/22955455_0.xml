<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, compared with scutellarin, it is very difficult to obtain scutellarein from Nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study focused on establishing an efficient route for the synthesis of scutellarein by hydrolyzing scutellarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume with the administration of scutellarein were then used to compare its neuroprotective effects on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion in rats induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with those of scutellarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that scutellarein had better protective effect on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion than scutellarin, which laid the foundation for further research and development of scutellarein as a promising candidate for ischemic cerebro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
