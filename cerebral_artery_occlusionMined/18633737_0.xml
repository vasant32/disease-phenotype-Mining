<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim is to investigate the effect of neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta) on the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the expressions of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in rats following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animal models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) were established by an intraluminal filament method from left external-internal carotid artery in 100 cases of adult healthy male Wister rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NRG-1beta was administered from the internal carotid artery (ICA) into <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transference-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression alternations of STAT3 and GFAP proteins were determined by fluorescent labeling analysis and Western blotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic cerebral injury could induce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, with the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the amount of apoptotic cells increased in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These apoptotic cells distributed in various brain regions, especially the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, while only a small amount of apoptotic cells could be observed in the treatment group, and there were significant differences compared with that in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressions of STAT3 and GFAP proteins in brain tissue gradually increased in the control group with the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And NRG-1beta could elevate the expressional level of STAT3 and GFAP proteins in contrast to the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NRG-1beta may play a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemic insult by activating JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway, promoting the astrocyte gumnosis and regulating the anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mechanism in neurocytes </plain></SENT>
