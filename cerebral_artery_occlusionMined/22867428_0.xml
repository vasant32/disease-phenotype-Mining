<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the beta2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unclear as pharmacological manipulations of the β2AR have produced contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that mice deficient in the β2AR (β2KO) had smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (FVB) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate mechanisms of this neuroprotection we evaluated changes in gene expression using microarrays comparing differences before and after MCAO, and differences between genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were enriched after MCAO in both genotypes, and we identified several genes not previously shown to increase following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (Ccl9, Gem, and Prg4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to networks that were similar between genotypes, one network with a central core of G protein-coupled receptor and including biological functions carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was identified in FVB mice but not in β2KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of differences between genotypes revealed 11 genes differentially expressed by genotype both before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate greater Glo1 protein levels and lower Pmaip/Noxa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in β2KO mice in both sham and MCAO conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As both genes are implicated in NFκB signaling, we measured p65 activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFα) levels 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO-induced p65 activation and post-ischemic TNFα production were both greater in FVB compared to β2KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that loss of β2AR signaling results in a neuroprotective phenotype in part due to decreased NFκB signaling, decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and decreased apoptotic signaling in the brain </plain></SENT>
