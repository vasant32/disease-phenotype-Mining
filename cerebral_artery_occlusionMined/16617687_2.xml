<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 30 mg/kg, i.p., cell proliferation marker) and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-6,6'-di(4-sulfophenyl)-3,3',3',3' -tetramethylindocarbo-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="52295">cyanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>, 1 microg/ microl, i.c.v, lipophilic neuronal tracer) combined with multiple fluorescence immunostaining were used to determine whether the proliferated cells were newly generated neurons and where they originated from in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that EA treatment (60 Hz 1 s and 2 Hz 3 s alternately at an intensity of 10 mA for 20 min on "Fengfu", GV.16 and "Jinsuo", GV.8) enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced striatal neurogenesis in rat brains as follows: 1) EA increased the number of BrdU+ cells, indicating that it activates cell proliferation; 2) EA increased BrdU+/CRMP-4(+) (collapsing response mediated protein-4, immature neuron marker) and BrdU+/MAP-2(+) (microtubule-associated protein 2, mature neuron marker) cells, suggesting that it facilitates neurogenesis and maturation of newly generated neurons; 3) EA expanded the distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>-stained cells in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most BrdU+/CRMP-4(+) or BrdU+/MAP-2(+) cells in the striatum were observed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi>+ staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results suggest that striatal newborn neurons mainly migrate from the cells lining ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that EA can improve neuronal regeneration, newborn neuron migration and their maturation in the striatum of adult rat brains after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
