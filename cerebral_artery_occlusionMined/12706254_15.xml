<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that use of 5-0 curved or 6-0 straight suture for carotid cannulation might decrease SAH and that the application of a microvascular clip to the common carotid artery (CCA) might decrease variability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and explain the results of these technical modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strain related differences in vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups for permanent and temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of 5-0 curved suture and 6-0 straight suture insertion with and without CCA clip application were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After permanent MCAO, larger and more consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes resulted using CCA clip application with a 6-0 but not with a 5-0 suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After temporary MCAO, the SAH rate was 12.5% with a 5-0 curved suture and 11.1% with a 6-0 straight suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 40% rate was observed in a pilot study with 5-0 straight suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume after temporary MCAO with a CCA clip was significantly larger and variability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was smaller than without the CCA clip using 5-0 curved and 6-0 straight suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, SAH is less frequent using a 5-0 curved or 6-0 straight suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume is enlarged by application of a CCA clip (249) </plain></SENT>
