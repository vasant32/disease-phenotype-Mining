<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new strategy for the treatment of neuronal injury involves inhibition of the neuropeptidase <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> carboxypeptidase II (GCP II), also known as N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GCP II is believed to mediate the hydrolysis of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-aspartyl-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (NAAG) to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, and inhibition of NAAG peptidase activity (by GCP II and other peptidases) is neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were generated in which the Folh1 gene encoding GCP II was disrupted (Folh1-/- mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No overt behavioral differences were apparent between Folh1-/- mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates, with respect to their overall performance in locomotion, coordination, pain threshold, cognition and psychiatric behavioral paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis of peripheral nerves, however, showed significantly smaller axons (reduced myelin sheaths and axon diameters) in sciatic nerves from Folh1-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following sciatic nerve crush, Folh1-/- mice suffered less injury and recovered faster than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a model of ischemic injury, the Folh1-/- mice exhibited a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates when subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that GCP II inhibitors may represent a novel treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
