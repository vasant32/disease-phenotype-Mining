<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, TAK-937, a novel potent and selective CB(1) and CB(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, was shown to exert significant cerebroprotective effects accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> itself induces significant neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we examined the relative contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and CB(1) receptor activation to the cerebroprotective effects of TAK-937 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a multichannel brain temperature controlling system we developed, the brain temperature of freely moving rats was telemetrically monitored and maintained between 37 and 38°C during intravenous infusion of TAK-937 (100 µg/kg/h) or vehicle for 24 h after 2 h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AM251, a selective CB(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was administered intraperitoneally at 30 mg/kg 30 min before starting intravenous infusion of TAK-937 (100 µg/kg/h) for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed and their brains were isolated 26 h after MCAO in both experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the hypothermic effect of TAK-937 was completely reversed by a brain temperature controlling system, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-reducing effect of TAK-937 was attenuated in part, but remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, concomitant AM251 treatment with TAK-937 completely abolished the hypothermic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-reducing effects of TAK-937 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that the cerebroprotective effects of TAK-937 were at least in part mediated by induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, and mainly mediated by CB(1) receptor activation </plain></SENT>
