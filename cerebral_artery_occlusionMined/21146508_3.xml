<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to its anti-aggregant properties, recent studies have reported that DP promotes anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test whether post-treatment with DP may exert protection after ischemic cerebral injury in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, rats were subjected to 120 min or 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24 or 48 h of reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either DP (100mg/kg) or vehicle was administered i.v. at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion; rats subjected to 90 min MCAO also received additional doses of DP orally (60 mg/kg) at 24 and 36 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases, extravasated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content and IL-6, MIP-1α and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 cytokine level were examined in brain tissue by zymography, western blot and multiple ELISA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DP post-treatment led to a neurological improvement in both models (p &lt; 0.05) and a significant reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of rats subjected to 90 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as compared to vehicle group (7.9% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection was accompanied by a modest increase in expression of MMP-9 pro-form and a significant attenuation of MIP-1α levels in the infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide support for the development of novel therapies based on DP for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In selected animals, intravenous administration of high dose DP induced an adverse hypotensive effect leading to rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, alternative ways of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration must be examined in order to avoid this unfavorable effect </plain></SENT>
