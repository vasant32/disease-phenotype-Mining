<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oxidative and inflammatory damage have been suggested to play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis, and provide promising therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a pleiotropic transcription factor, has been shown to play a key role in protecting cells against oxidative injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9908">ursolic acid</z:chebi> (UA), a natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25872">pentacyclic triterpenoid</z:chebi> acid, isolated from edible plants in the Oleaceae family, a well-known anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reagent, protects the brain against ischemic injury by activating the Nrf2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nrf2(-/-) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were induced into focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and received UA treatment immediately after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The behavioral dysfunction, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and inflammatory factors (TLR4 and NF-ÎºB) in ischemic brain were measured at 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UA treatment significantly improved neurological deficit and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in WT mice after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of UA also decreased the product of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, promoted the activation of Nrf2 pathway and decreased the expression of TLR4 and NF-KB after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Nrf2(-/-) mice demonstrated more severe neurologic deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and inflammatory damage after MCAO, and did not benefit from the protective effect of UA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicated that UA protected the brain against ischemic injury in mice by anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of the Nrf2 pathway contributes to the neuroprotective effects induced by UA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
