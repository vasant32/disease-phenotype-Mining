<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that CO can be therapeutic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury; however, it is unclear whether CO can also offer protection in permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or what mechanism(s) underlies the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 neuroprotection was shown to be regulated by Nrf2; therefore, we investigated whether CO might partially exert neuroprotection by modulating the Nrf2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the potential protective effects of CO, we exposed male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and Nrf2-knockout mice to 250 ppm CO or control air for 18 hours immediately after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurologic deficits were assessed on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 pathway activation by CO were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice exposed to CO after permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had 29.6Â±12.6% less brain damage than did controls at 7 days, although amelioration in neurologic deficits did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 18-hour CO treatment led to Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1, nuclear translocation, increased binding activity of Nrf2 to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 antioxidant response elements, and elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 expression 6 to 48 hours after CO exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CO neuroprotection was completely abolished in Nrf2-knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-concentration CO represent a neuroprotective agent for combination treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and its beneficial effect would be at least partially mediated by activation of the Nrf2 pathway </plain></SENT>
