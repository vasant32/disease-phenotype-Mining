<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An on-line pH meter that can be mounted in microdialysis systems is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pH monitoring system was tested in rat cortex before and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After probe implantation, pH values in the dialysate quickly reached a stable level that depended on perfusion medium (6.72, Ringer; 6.47, 0.9% saline) and flow rate (2 microliters/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, pH values sank rapidly and significantly, whereas lactic and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> levels in the dialysate increased 9- to 12-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pH of the dialysate is lower than that of the extracellular fluid because the relative recovery of carbon dioxide is about twice that of bicarbonate at the flow rate used, as shown in in vitro experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pH meter would provide useful additional information during monitoring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, not only in experimental situations but also during neurosurgical intensive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the latter case, the on-line pH value would be a bedside parameter enabling fast feedback for setting analytical priorities and making therapeutical decisions </plain></SENT>
