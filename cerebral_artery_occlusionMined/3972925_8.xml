<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A battery of imaging techniques was used for simultaneous evaluation of regional blood flow, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, protein synthesis, pH, and the regional tissue content of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, ATP, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was monitored by EEG frequency analysis and recording of somatosensory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, a close correlation existed between the degree of electrophysiological changes and biochemical alterations, in particular with the extent of tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, decrease of tissue <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> content, and suppression of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was only a poor correlation with blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of these exhibited a greatly inhomogeneous pattern with regions of reduced, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or increased rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In areas remote from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the content of biochemical substrates was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but blood flow was reduced globally by approximately 50% and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization by approximately 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An anatomically defined regional pattern of cerebral or cerebellar diaschisis was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, imaging of blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization does not provide an accurate estimate of the actual functional or metabolic disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the clinical evaluation of the development or treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in consequence, alternative noninvasive techniques such as imaging of protein synthesis and/or pH may be more relevant </plain></SENT>
