<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EphB2/ephrinBs has been recently demonstrated to regulate cell proliferation in the neurogenic subventricular zone (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of EphB2 in adult neurogenesis following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of EphB2 in proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells within the SVZ, as well as the neurological function recovery after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given twice per day starting from 24h after MCAO for 6-consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant EphB2-Fc or IgG-Fc was preclustered by incubation with anti-human Fcgamma and then intraventricularly administrated at 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological function was evaluated before operation and at 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and immunoreactivities of BrdU, Nestin, DCX, GFAP and NeuN were measured at 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with EphB2-Fc markedly improved the neurological function recovery within 3 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, EphB2-Fc significantly increased the number of BrdU-labeled cells and led to marked increases in BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/Nestin+ cells within the ipsilateral SVZ for 2 weeks after MCAO respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and neighboring ipsilateral striatum were significantly increased following EphB2-Fc infusion within 3 weeks after MCAO (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that administration of exogenous clustered EphB2-Fc at 24h can enhance the endogenous neurogenesis and concomitantly improve neurological recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
