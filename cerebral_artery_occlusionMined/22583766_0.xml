<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the lesion extent and its reproducibility vary among laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The properties of nylon filament play a part of reasons for these variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used paraffin-coated nylon filament for rat MCAO model, tested the effects and advanced improvement for making the rat MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized into two groups, MCAO with traditional uncoated nylon filament (uMCAO) and MCAO with paraffin-coated nylon filament (cMCAO), three rats as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group and sham group respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment included mortality rates, model success rates, neurological deficit evaluation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study showed two rats died in uMCAO group, no rat died in cMCAO group within the 12h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model success rate of uMCAO was 100%, while the uMCAO group was 55% (n=20, two died within 12h, seven rats were excluded as the brain slices showed no TTC staining due to subarachanoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation demonstrated group cMCAO had more worse neurological outcomes than group uMCAO, and the difference was statistically signification (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TTC staining cMCAO group had significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes than uMCAO group, and also showed statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The result demonstrated that the paraffin-coated nylon filament intraluminal occlusion provide better occlusion of middle cerebral artery than the uncoated nylon filament, improve the consistent of model, and raise the success rate to reduce the number of experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These positive results are much encouraging and interesting </plain></SENT>
