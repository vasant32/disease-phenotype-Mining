<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was approved by the Animal Experiments Ethics Committee of Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey and carried out from March 2006 to August 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 Sprague-Dawley rats (200-320 g) were divided into 4 groups: control (K) group (n = 7); HBO group (n = 7); HBO + AG group (n = 7); and the AG group (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by subtemporal craniectomy, and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2.8 atmospheric pressure of HBO was first applied to the HBO and HBO + AG groups for 45 minutes, and occlusion was created after 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the HBO + AG group, intraperitoneal administration of AG hemisulfate (100 mg/kg) was started 6 hours after MCAO, and was continued twice a day for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of infarction was found to be 22.2+/-3.1% in the control group, 16.1+/-2.7% in the HBO group, 15.2+/-1.9% in the HBO+AG group, and 14.4+/-3.3% in the AG groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of infarctions (therefore the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) in the HBO, HBO + AG, and AG groups were found to be significantly decreased compared with the control group (p=0.002, p=0.001, and p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In permanent MCAO-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats, HBO and AG were observed to have a lowering effect on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, but no additive effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This situation can be explained by different mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
