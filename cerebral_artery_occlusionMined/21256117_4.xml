<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an increasing body of evidence suggests several non-apoptotic functions of CC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve our understanding of the relation between cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-related and non-adverse effects of postischemic caspase-3 activation, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution and identity of CC3-positive cells at days 2, 3 and 4 after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lacking colocalization of CC3 and TUNEL staining indicated, that CC3 expression was predominantly non-apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear CC3 expression was frequently found to be colocalized with GFAP-positive astrocytes within the tissue adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, whereas cytoplasmatic CC3 expression occurred solely in the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple fluorescence labeling revealed costaining of cytoplasmatic CC3 with markers directed against astrocytes, macrophages/microglia and supposedly pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that CC3 expression was predominantly associated with cellular responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> such as reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> and the infiltration of macrophages </plain></SENT>
