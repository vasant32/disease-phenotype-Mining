<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, compounds that block the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> may be useful as cerebroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cerebroprotective properties of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release inhibitor, BW619C89 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the studies reported here, the effect of BW619C89 [4-amino-2-(4-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1-piperazinyl)-5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi>] on neurotransmitter release (endogenous amino acids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>) from slices of rat brain cerebral cortex in vitro has been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective efficacy of BW619C89 has been evaluated using the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the Fischer 344 rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the in vitro studies, BW619C89 inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratrine</z:chebi>- (but not <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-) evoked release of both endogenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> from rat cerebral cortex slices with IC50 values of approximately 5 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BW619C89 was approximately 10-fold less potent to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratrine</z:chebi>-evoked 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> release (IC50 = 51 microM), fourfold less potent to inhibit 3H-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> release (IC50 = 21 microM), and at 10 microM had only weak activity at excitatory amino acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>, kainate, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When administered intravenously to Fischer 344 rats 5 minutes after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, BW619C89 produced marked reductions of both total (cortex and basal ganglia) and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced by 20% at a dose of BW619C89 of 5 mg/kg (n = 6, not significant); 43% at 10 mg/kg (n = 8, P &lt; .01); 59% at 20 mg/kg (n = 8, P &lt; .001); 61% at 30 mg/kg (n = 8, P &lt; .001), and 53% at 40 mg/kg (n = 8, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BW619C89 at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg also significantly reduced noncortical (basal ganglia) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, demonstrating that a proportion of this tissue also appears to be salvageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Behavioral effects observed were dose related, generally minor, and at doses of 20 mg/kg IV and above consisted of body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> lasting approximately 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release inhibitors such as BW619C89 may provide an alternative to excitatory amino acid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
