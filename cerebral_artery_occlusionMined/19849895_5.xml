<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To deliver these cells, an IV injection appears safer than a local graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the whole-body biodistribution of IV-injected (99m)Tc-HMPAO-labeled hMSC in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (n = 9) and following a right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo, n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-body nuclear imaging, isolated organ counting (at 2 and 20 h after injection) and histology were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher activity was observed in the right damaged hemisphere of the MCAo group [6.5 +/- 0.9 x 10(-3) % of injected dose (ID)/g] than in the control group (3.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(-3) %ID/g), 20 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In MCAo rats, right hemisphere activity was higher than that observed in the contralateral hemisphere at 2 h after injection (11.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 9.8 +/- 1.7 x 10(-3) %ID/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following an initial hMSC lung accumulation, there was a decrease in pulmonary activity from 2 to 20 h after injection in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spleen was the only organ in which activity increased between 2 and 20 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of hMSC was documented in the spleen, liver, lung, and brain following histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IV-injected hMSC are transiently trapped in the lungs, can be sequestered in the spleen, and are predominantly eliminated by kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 20 h, more hMSC are found in the ischemic lesion than into the undamaged cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IV delivery of hMSC could be the initial route for a clinical trial of tolerance </plain></SENT>
