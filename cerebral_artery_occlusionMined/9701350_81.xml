<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it also increases vascular permeability, and might exacerbate ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of this factor on the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> was investigated in terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, as well as cellular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, VEGF (1.0 ng/microL, 9 microL) was topically applied on the surface of the reperfused rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was found in animals with VEGF application (P &lt; 0.001) at 24 hours of reperfusion as compared with cases with vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in VEGF-treated animals (P = 0.01), and furthermore, extravasation of Evans blue was also decreased in those animals (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> in situ nick end labeling and immunohistochemical analysis for 70-kDa heat shock protein showed an amelioration of the stainings at 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion with VEGF treatment, which indicated reduction of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that treatment with topical VEGF application significantly reduces ischemic brain damage, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and extravasation of Evans blue, and that the reductions were associated with that of neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
