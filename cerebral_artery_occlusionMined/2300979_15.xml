<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trigeminal (vibrissae), median (forelimb), and sciatic (hind limb) nerve stimuli produced consistent, robust, and sharply localized responses in the trigeminal, forelimb, and hind limb regions of the somatosensory cortex of 18 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These regions are situated at sequentially greater distances from the center of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight rats, occlusion 1-2 mm below the rhinal fissure abolished somatosensory evoked potentials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cortical region within minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive wavelets preceding the primary cortical response were also diminished by the occlusion, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> affected the thalamocortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of these eight rats did not show histologically apparent ischemic involvement of the hind limb cortical region at 3 hours after occlusion; sciatic nerve evoked potentials recovered substantially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four rats, and the amplitudes exceeded baseline (129 +/- 30% at 1 hour, 173 +/- 33% at 3 hours) in three of the four rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the eight rats did not have gross ischemic involvement of the forelimb cortical region; median nerve evoked potentials recovered fully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight rats, but the amplitudes did not exceed baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight rats had evidence of ischemic damage in the trigeminal cortex; no rat showed full recovery in this region, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one had trigeminal evoked potentials that were less than 20% of baseline amplitudes by 3 hours after occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
