<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported that atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> have neuroprotective effects against brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> on ischemic brain injury was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 1h and then underwent reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size induced by MCAO was significantly reduced in the animals that received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with 5mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> and subchronic treatment with 2.5mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> for 7 days compared with that in the vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> significantly improved neurological functions, as measured by the modified neurological severity score, in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subchronic treatment produced more rapid recovery from functional deficits than the vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical investigation revealed that the subchronic treatment prevented severe loss of neuronal marker intensity and attenuated the increased in microglial marker intensity in the infarcted cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> has neuroprotective effects in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and provide new insight for its clinical applications </plain></SENT>
