<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] has anti-inflammatory effects in peripheral organs, but its effects in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are unclear as yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether its anti-inflammatory effect contributes to the neuroprotection induced by Ang-(1-7) in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We infused Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> A-779, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> PD123319 or artificial CSF into the right lateral ventricle of male Sprague-Dawley rats from 48 h before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pMCAO until the rats were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after pMCAO, the neuroprotective effect of Ang-(1-7) was analysed by evaluating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were detected by spectrophotometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activation of NF-κB was assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of COX-2 was tested by Western blot analysis and concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by elisa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Infusion of Ang-(1-7), i.c.v., significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It decreased the levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and suppressed NF-κB activity, which was accompanied by a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and COX-2 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects of Ang-(1-7) were reversed by A-779 but not by PD123319 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, infusion of A-779 alone increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> levels and enhanced NF-κB activity, which was accompanied by an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that suppressing NF-κB dependent pathway via Mas receptor may represent one mechanism that contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of Ang-(1-7) in rats with pMCAO </plain></SENT>
