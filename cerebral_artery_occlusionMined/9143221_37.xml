<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The wider clinical acceptance of thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has focused more attention on experimental models of reversible focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such models enable the study of the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of various durations and of reperfusion on the development of infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used high-resolution <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CMRglc) before, during, and up to 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After determination of resting values, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded by a transorbital device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was reopened after 30 min in five, after 60 min in 11, and after 120 min in two cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats survived 30-min MCAO, six died after 60-min and one after 120-min MCAO during 6-20 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those cats surviving the first day, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined on serial histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> immediately reduced CBF in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory to &lt; 40% of control, while CMRO2 was less affected, causing an increase in OEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas in the cats surviving 24 h of reperfusion after 60- and 120-min MCAO, OEF remained elevated throughout the ischemic episode, the initial OEF increase had already disappeared during the later period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in those cats that died during the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 30-min MCAO, the reperfusion period was characterized by a transient reactive hyperemia and fast normalization of CBF, CMRO2, and CMRglc, and no or only small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the deep nuclei were found in histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 60- and 120-min MCAO, the extent of hyperperfusion was related to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, decreased CMRO2 and CMRglc persisted, and cortical/subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of varying sizes developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A clear difference was found in the flow/metabolic pattern between surviving and dying cats: In cats dying during the observation period, extended postischemic hyperperfusion accompanied large defects in CMRO2 and CMRglc, large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> developed, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increased</z:e> fatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In those surviving the day after MCAO, increased OEF persisted over the ischemic episode, postischemic hyperperfusion was less severe and shorter, and the perfusional and metabolic defects as well as the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results stress the importance of the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for the further course after reperfusion and help to explain the diverging outcome after thrombolysis, where a relation between the residual flow and the effectiveness of reperfusion was also observed </plain></SENT>
