<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Capillary perfusion patterns (perfused capillaries versus nonperfused capillaries) were verified immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in one group of rats and 1 h later in a second group using fluorescent double staining of capillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and plasma perfusion in identical brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, local cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in another group of rats 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion using the autoradiographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although cortical CBF was decreased by up to 75% 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, plasma perfusion was not completely stopped in most capillaries (circulation time of Evans blue, 10 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only small patchy perfusion deficits (&lt; 0.1 mm2 of brain section) were detected in the capillaries immediately and 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brains except for one that exhibited a more extensive lack of capillary perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data show that a drastic reduction of cortical CBF after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is not accompanied by a corresponding amount of nonperfused capillaries </plain></SENT>
