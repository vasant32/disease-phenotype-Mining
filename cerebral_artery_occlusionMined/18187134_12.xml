<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced using suture-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MMP activation was examined with in situ and gel zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injury to cerebral endothelial cells and basal lamina was assessed using endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) and collagen IV immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injury to neurons and glial cells was assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">Cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were examined at 3 h after reperfusion (8 h after initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and compared with permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at the same time points to assess the effects of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> (p-aminobenzoyl-Gly-Pro<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30005">-D-Leu</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29949">-D-Ala</z:chebi>-hydroxamate, 50 mg/kg intravenously) was administered 30 min before reperfusion to assess the roles of MMPs in activating gelatinolytic enzymes and in reperfusion-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that reperfusion accelerated and potentiated MMP-9 and MMP-2 activation and injury to EBA and collagen IV immunopositive microvasculature and to neurons and glial cells in ischemic cortex and striatum relative to permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administering <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> 30 min before reperfusion decreased MMP-9 activation and neurovascular injury in ischemic cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
