<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the rat brain, ASS is expressed in neurons, ASL in neurons and astroglia in the striatum, both are co-expressed with nNOS in medium-sized neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microglia cells express iNOS and ASS after activation but no information is available on ASL and on ASS/ASL/iNOS co-expression in this glial population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present aim was to ascertain, by immunohistochemistry, whether the microglia cells of the rat striatum and fronto-parietal cortex express ASL and ASS in control conditions and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and whether ASL and ASS are co-expressed with iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted 24, 72 and 144 h after reperfusion in two groups of ischemic rats with different tissue damage and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ASS and ASL are not expressed by microglia cells in controls while are present in most of the activated microglia cells in the ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those animals with longer survival, ASS and ASL were no more detectable at 144 h, while, in the animals with shorter survival, they were co-expressed with iNOS, but only at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cortex, at variance with the striatum, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of nNOS-positive neurons co-expressed ASS and ASL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, only activated microglia cells express ASS and ASL, this expression precedes that of iNOS and does not necessarily imply its appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, local factors such as the NO produced by nNOS/ASS/ASL-positive neurons, could influence ASS/ASL-positive microglia cells avoiding or allowing the induction, in these cells, of iNOS </plain></SENT>
