<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rheb is a recently identified member of the Ras super-family and is an immediate early gene that is rapidly and transiently induced in the hippocampal granule cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-dependent synaptic activity in the long term potentiation paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The close homologies with Ras and its rapid inducibility strongly suggest that Rheb shares many biochemical and signaling properties with Ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion on the expression of Rheb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization autoradiography showed that Rheb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced in the extensive regions of cerebral cortex and medial striatum surrounding the ischemic region and bilateral hippocampal formation following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induction of Rheb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cingulate cortex persisted prominently at 24 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the Rheb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction in the medial striatum and hippocampal formation decreased after 8h of occlusion, it still remained significant at 24h of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest the possibility that Ras signaling pathways can be implicated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-elicited events through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation </plain></SENT>
