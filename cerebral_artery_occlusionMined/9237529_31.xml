<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since disruption of this transport results in APP accumulation, APP has been proposed as a sensitive marker of axonal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, axonal injury in subcortical white matter and myelinated fibre tracts permeating the striatum, 24 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat, has been examined by assessing the location and extent of APP immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased APP immunoreactivity was present in both areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was localised to a circumscribed zone immediately adjacent to the boundary of the ischaemic lesion in grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of APP immunoreactivity was associated with the volume of the ischaemic lesion in individual animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased APP immunoreactivity in subcortical white matter and myelinated fibre tracts at the margin of the ischaemic zone may prove to be a valuable marker for assessing strategies to protect axons after an ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
