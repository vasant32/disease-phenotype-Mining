<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous work has demonstrated that physiological concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> can protect the female rat brain against middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether therapeutic doses of the clinically relevant selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50739">estrogen receptor modulator</z:chebi> (SERM), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>, can similarly protect the female rat brain against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult female rats were bilaterally ovariectomized and implanted subcutaneously with either a placebo or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> time-release pellet (0.1, 0.8 or 2.4 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week later, the animals underwent permanent MCAO to assess the protective ability of the different <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> doses on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, MCAO produced a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ( approximately 53%) of the affected cerebral hemisphere in placebo (control) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 0.1 mg/kg/day dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> did not exhibit any significant protective effects, however; the 0.8 and 2.4 mg/kg/day doses of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>, which are in the therapeutic range, dramatically reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the affected cerebral hemisphere ( approximately 70% reduction) as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was primarily due to protection of two major structures, the cerebral cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler analysis further revealed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> had no significant effect on cerebral blood flow either before or after MCAO, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> protection is independent of cerebral blood flow changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> pellets implanted at the time of MCAO did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, suggesting that pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> is necessary to observe a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that clinically important SERMs may have an additional unrecognized beneficial effect of protection of the female brain </plain></SENT>
