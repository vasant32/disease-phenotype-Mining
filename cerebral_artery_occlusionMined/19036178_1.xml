<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate whether neutralization of rat interleukin 6 (IL-6) bioactivity attenuates inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) up-regulation and ameliorates cerebral ischemic damage in a model of focal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy rats were randomly allocated to groups: Group I (n=10) consisted of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; Group II (n=20) underwent surgical exposure of the middle cerebral artery but no cauterization; the remaining 40 rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after occlusion, each of these 40 rats was randomly assigned to either the occlusion-only group (Group III, n=20) or the occlusion plus IL-6 antibody treatment group (Group IV, n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of the rats from each of Groups II, III and IV were eternized at 24 hours and the other half at 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples were used for iNOS immunohistochemistry and structural analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single dose of the antibody had no effect on structural changes and iNOS at 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, administering three doses of the antibody resulted in markedly decreased quantitative and qualitative levels of iNOS-positive stained cells and milder subcellular damage compared with the findings in the occlusion-only group at 72 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our findings prove that IL-6 bioactivity is one of the pathological events that trigger the induction of iNOS in the process of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that there may be therapeutic value in neutralization of IL-6 bioactivity to attenuate iNOS up-regulation and ameliorate cerebral ischemic damage in long-term recovery </plain></SENT>
