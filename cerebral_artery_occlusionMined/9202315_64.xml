<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) detected by PANT were present in neurons after as little as 1 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numbers of neurons containing an SSB increased progressively in the ischemic core but decreased in the ischemic penumbra after 1 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) detected by TUNEL were first seen in neurons after 1 h of reperfusion, and their numbers then increased progressively in the ischemic core, with a regional distribution similar to that of SSBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the number of SSB-containing cells was greater than that of DSB-containing cells at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSB-containing cells detected within the first hour of reperfusion were exclusively neuronal and exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 16-72 h of reperfusion, many SSB- and DSB-containing cells, including both neurons and astrocytes, showed morphological changes consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gel electrophoresis of DNA isolated from the ischemic core showed DNA fragmentation at 24 h, when both SSBs and DSBs were present, but not at 1 h, when few DSBs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that damage to nuclear DNA is an early event after neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that the accumulation of unrepaired DNA SSBs may contribute to delayed ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, perhaps by triggering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
