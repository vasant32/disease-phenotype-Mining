<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The db/db diabetic and db/+ mice were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of plasma SDF-1α and circulating CD34+CXCR4+ cells were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression were quantified at basal and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In in vitro study, EPCs were transfected with adenovirus carrying null (Ad-null) or CXCR4 (Ad-CXCR4) followed with high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HG) treatment for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For pathway block experiments, cells were pre-incubated with PI3K inhibitor or nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) inhibitor for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CXCR4 expression, function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of EPCs were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p-Akt/Akt and p-eNOS/eNOS expression in EPCs were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In in vivo study, EPCs transfected with Ad-null or Ad-CXCR4 were infused into mice via tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 2 and 7, the cerebral blood flow, neurologic deficit score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, cerebral microvascular density, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found: 1) The levels of plasma SDF-1α and circulating CD34+CXCR4+ cells were decreased in db/db mice; 2) The basal level of SDF-1α and MCAO-induced up-regulation of SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis were reduced in the brain of db/db mice; 3) Ad-CXCR4 transfection increased CXCR4 expression in EPCs and enhanced EPC colonic forming capacity; 4) Ad-CXCR4 transfection prevented EPCs from HG-induced dysfunction (migration and tube formation) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via activation of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signal pathway; 4) Ad-CXCR4 transfection enhanced the efficacy of EPC infusion in attenuating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that Ad-CXCR4 primed EPCs have better therapeutic effects for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than unmodified EPCs do </plain></SENT>
