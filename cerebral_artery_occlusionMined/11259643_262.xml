<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> have been proposed as mechanisms of cellular demise, and either could be the target of actions of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates whether antiapoptotic mechanisms can account for the neuroprotective actions of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of EPO (5,000 units/kg of body weight, i.p.) after middle-cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats dramatically reduces the volume of infarction 24 h later, in concert with an almost complete reduction in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling of neurons within the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both pure and mixed neuronal cultures, EPO (0.1--10 units/ml) also inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by serum deprivation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protection requires pretreatment, consistent with the induction of a gene expression program, and is sustained for 3 days without the continued presence of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPO (0.3 units/ml) also protects hippocampal neurons against <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and protein kinase Akt-1/protein kinase B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The action of EPO is not limited to directly promoting cell survival, as EPO is trophic but not mitogenic in cultured neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that inhibition of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> underlies short latency protective effects of EPO after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and other brain injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurotrophic actions suggest there may be longer-latency effects as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of EPO, a compound established as clinically safe, as neuroprotective therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury is further supported </plain></SENT>
