<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As extended use may increase the probability of unwanted effects, careful safety evaluation is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the safety profile and beneficial effects of CEUS in a reperfusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were subjected to filament occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was established after 90 minutes, followed by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment and randomization to additional CEUS (contrast agent: SonoVue; 60 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blinded outcome evaluation consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurologic assessment, and histology and, in separate experiments, quantitative 3D nano-computed tomography (CT) angiography (900 nm(3) voxel size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nano-CT revealed severely compromised microcirculation in untreated animals after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rt-PA partially improved hemispheric perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impairment was completely reversed in animals receiving rt-PA and CEUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This combination was more effective than treatment with either CEUS without rt-PA or rt-PA and ultrasound or ultrasound alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In MRI experiments, CEUS and rt-PA treatment resulted in a significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No unwanted effects were detected on MRI, histology, and intracranial temperature assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study shows that CEUS and rt-PA is safe in the situation of reperfusion and displays beneficial effects on the level of the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
