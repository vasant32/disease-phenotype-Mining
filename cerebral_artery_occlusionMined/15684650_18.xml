<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> exerts dose-dependent effects, both beneficial and detrimental, on the outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that co-administration of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg) and a low amount of alcohol (0.65 g/kg; caffeinol) reduces cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume up to 80%, and improves motor coordination, following a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of reversible common carotid/middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the protective effects of caffeinol following other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> insults, nor its influence on cognitive function, have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a controlled cortical impact model of brain injury, the effect of caffeinol administration on TBI-associated motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When given 15 min following injury, caffeinol reduced cortical tissue loss and improved working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no influence on motor skills, <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> performance or associative learning and memory was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed administration (6 h post-injury) of caffeinol containing a dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> (1 g/kg) previously demonstrated to improve motor performance eliminated the working memory benefit and cortical protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that early administration of caffeinol may be beneficial in lessening some of the deficits and cortical tissue loss associated with brain trauma </plain></SENT>
