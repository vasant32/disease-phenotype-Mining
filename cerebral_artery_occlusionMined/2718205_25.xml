<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in 45 rats by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Groups of rats were investigated over a long period after occlusion, that is, from a few hours to 42 days after the production of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic changes closely resembled those found in ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in humans and followed a similar pattern over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the sizes of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the ipsilateral (operated) hemisphere, and the contralateral hemisphere from camera lucida drawings revealed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size changed with time after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats killed during the first 7 days (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase) had the largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; in rats killed thereafter, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the ipsilateral hemisphere also changed with time; during the first 7 days after occlusion this hemisphere was swollen and larger than the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes are caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the first 7 days, enlargement of the ipsilateral hemisphere gave way to a significant reduction in the size of both the ipsilateral hemisphere and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that the major reasons for this shift in size are resorption of fluid together with diminished production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and elimination of dead cells by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the amount of tissue loss (i.e., the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the remaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> "scar") found 21-42 days after occlusion (during the late phase) is a measure of the total amount of tissue that succumbed as a consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
