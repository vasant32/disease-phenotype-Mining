<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have documented the proliferative effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on neural progenitor cells in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of EGF on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cerebral expression of nestin, a marker of neural progenitor cells, has not been examined in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, adult renovascular hypertensive Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either real or sham middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injections of either 1 microg EGF or vehicle (0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mg/mL rat serum albumin) were made 24 and 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after MCAO, the postural reflex was evaluated in a blinded fashion before rat brains were processed to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume plus immunoreactivity for nestin and/or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another group of rats was used to quantify nestin expression using western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> that was largest at 1 week and diminished gradually over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The impaired postural reflex followed a similar time-course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, MCAO induced a marked increase in nestin expression in both hemispheres, with a higher expression in the right hemisphere; this change was maximal at 1 week and largely subsided at 3 or 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within the right hemisphere, nestin expression was most pronounced in the subventricular and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most nestin-immunoreactive cells were also positive for GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, EGF treatment significantly increases nestin expression, reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ameliorates postural reflex impairment in adult hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
