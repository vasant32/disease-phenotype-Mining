<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of six zinc finger IEG was examined using in situ hybridization in adult rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with the suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C, egr-2, egr-3, and Nurr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> induced throughout the ipsilateral cortex at 1 hour to 12 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cortical induction for most of the genes was greatest in the anterior cingulate and the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) transition zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the zinc finger IEG were induced at 1 hour in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NGFI-A and NGFI-B were induced in ipsilateral thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within areas of infarction, the basal IEG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and expression of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, decreased below control levels by 12 hours after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate early gene expression outside areas of infarction returned to control levels in most brain regions by 24 hours except for egr-3, which continued to be induced in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ ACA transition zone for 24 hours, and NGFI-A, which continued to be expressed in specific regions of the thalamus for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of these IEG in the cortex is likely caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, with the hippocampal and thalamic IEG induction being caused by activation of efferent cortical pathways to these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prominent induction of NGFI-B, NGFI-C, egr-2, and egr-3 in the anterior cingulate cortex, the ACA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> transition zone, and medial striatum could reflect the ischemic regions around <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prolonged NGFI-A expression observed in thalamus in this study, and in CA1 of hippocampus after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil in a previous study, suggests that the prolonged NGFI-A, expression could be the result of or the cause of the delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged NGFI-A expression, like c-fos and c-jun, seems to provide a marker for slowly dying neurons </plain></SENT>
