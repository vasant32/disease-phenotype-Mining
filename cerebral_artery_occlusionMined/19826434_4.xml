<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we compared the volumetric quantification of the perfusion deficit in two rat middle-cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) models using two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-based contrast agents (P1152 (Guerbet) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">Magnevist</z:chebi> (Bayer-Schering, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)) as compared with our well established continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) perfusion imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent either permanent MCAO or transient MCAO with 80-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed at four different time points after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the subregions of the ischemic zone (core, penumbra, transient reversal (TR), and sustained reversal (SR)) using P1152 showed significant reduction in blood flow in the core and TR subregions relative to the penumbral and SR subregions while occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, a significant increase in blood flow was recorded at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points after reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions except TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the ROI analysis the threshold for the penumbra was determined to be -62+/-11% and this value was subsequently used for quantification of the volumetric deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ischemic volume as defined by dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), was only statistically different from the CASL-derived ischemic volume when using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">Magnevist</z:chebi> at post-reperfusion time points </plain></SENT>
