<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven rhesus monkeys were used to construct the MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal evolution of the relative apparent diffusion coefficient (rADC) and the relative fractional anisotropy (rFA) in the IC area, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth area (IG), and reversible penumbra area (RP) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rADC increased in the three areas in the early stage of reperfusion (1 hour after the reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the rate of rADC improvement was significantly slower in IG than in IC and RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different temporal evolutions of rFA were observed in the three areas in the following stage of reperfusion (3-24 hours after the reperfusion), which continued to decline in IG but slightly elevated in IC and RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the evolution of DTI parameters can help in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in the penumbra and predict the growth of the infarction area after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
