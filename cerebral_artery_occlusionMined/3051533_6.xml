<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen adult cats were divided into an untreated group (Group 1, n = 8) and a treated group (Group 2, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after 10 minutes of ultraviolet irradiation, which selectively damaged endothelium in the pial vessels, the middle cerebral artery was occluded in both groups and maintained for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, 50 ng/kg/min TRK-100 was continuously infused intravenously following ultraviolet irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both the pial arteries and veins, platelet aggregate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the endothelium with subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively) inhibited during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Group 2 compared with Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, blood flow stasis in the pial veins was effectively prevented in Group 2 during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the pial artery diameter returned to the control level during the late period of occlusion, whereas in Group 1 the pial artery remained constricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TRK-100 can prevent microcirculatory derangement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
