<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into sham operation (sham, n = 10), model (n = 10), and EA (n = 10) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI/R model was established by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (modified Longa's thread occlusion method) for 2 hours and reperfusion for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (3 Hz, 1-3 mA) was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14) and "Baihui" (GV 20) for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>gamma-GCS protein expression of the parietotemporal region of cerebral cortex was detected by immunohistochemistry and gamma-GCS heavy subunit (gamma-GCSh) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gamma-GCS light subunit (gamma-GCSI) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were assayed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, the expression levels of gamma-GCS protein in the pyramidal cell layer of the cerebral cortical parietotemporal region, and y-GCSh <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gamma-GCSI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and the number of gamma-GCS immuno-reaction positive cells had no remarkable changes in the model group (P &gt; 0.05), while in comparison with the model group, the expression levels of cerebral cortical gamma-GCS protein, and gamma-GCSh <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gamma-GCSI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and the number of gamma-GCS immuno-reaction positive cells were increased considerably in the EA group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of GV 20 and GV 14 can upregulate expression levels of gamma-GCS protein, gamma-GCSh <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gamma-GCSI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of the cerebral cortical parietotemporal region in CI/R rats, which may contribute to its effect in protecting cerebral cortical cells from injury by clearing away excessive oxygen free radicals </plain></SENT>
