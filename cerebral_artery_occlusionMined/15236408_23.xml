<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether a novel magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) contrast agent (Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-sLe(x) A), which is designed to bind to activated endothelium could be detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (MRI) in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRIs (9.4T) of the brain were acquired 24 hours after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1 maps were acquired repeatedly before and up to 1.5 hours after the intravenous injection of either Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> or Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-sLe(x) A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of images included a pixel-by-pixel subtraction of T1 maps from the precontrast T1 maps and quantification of T1 within the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After injection of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-sLe(x) A, T1 decreased compared with precontrast levels, and an interhemispheric difference between the pre-post contrast T1 developed within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion at a mean time of 52 minutes after injection (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals injected with Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> did not exhibit changes in T1 signal intensity between regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, indicating that the reductions in T1 observed with Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-sLe(x) A were unrelated to blood-brain barrier breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent-labeled sLe(x) A administered intravenously was observed to bind to the endothelium of injured but not control brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that the contrast agent Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-sLe(x) A can be used to visualize early endothelial activation after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo with MRI </plain></SENT>
