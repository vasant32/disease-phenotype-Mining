<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether DPI shows neuroprotective properties after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and we used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), a nonspecific free radical scavenger, as a solvent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In male Wistar rats middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1.5 h) and subsequent reperfusion (48 h) (MCAO/R) was induced with the filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion the animals received either 0.25 ml <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, DMSO, or a combination of DMSO and DPI; each group consisted of 10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed at different times after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gelatine zymography of brain tissue for MMP-2 and MMP-9 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage showed a significant difference between controls and the DPI/DMSO group for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> points in time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly reduced by DPI/DMSO but not by DMSO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DMSO treatment alone resulted in a protective effect with reduced lesion sizes measured by MRI at selected points of time, consistent with its known free radical scavenger effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of DMSO with DPI partly augmented this effect, presumably due to the additional inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by DPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neurological outcome in both therapeutic groups was improved compared to controls with a significant difference between the therapeutic groups in favour of DPI and DMSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of DPI and DMSO reduced the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, attenuated the postischemic blood-brain barrier damage and improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was most likely due to reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
