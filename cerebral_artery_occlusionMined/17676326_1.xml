<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to determine the delayed expression of mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors, following 1, 2, 7, and 30 days of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative autoradiography, we highlighted significant decreases in mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor expression in ipsilateral cortices from day 1 post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in contralateral nucleus lateralis thalami pars posterior, ipsi- and contralateral nucleus medialis dorsalis thalami, and ipsilateral substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr), kappa receptors were increased; mu receptor densities were decreased in nucleus ventralis thalami, pars posterior (VThP), and SNr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>delta-Binding sites were increased in the striatum on day 30 post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alterations in opioid receptors in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were correlated with strong histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further reductions in opioid receptor densities in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subcortical brain regions, opioid receptor densities were also altered but no histological damage was seen, except in the VThP, in which cell density was increased on day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed reductions in opioid receptor densities in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> appeared as the continuation of the early processes previously demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, changes in subcortical opioid receptor expression may correlate with neuronal alterations in remote brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in opioidergic receptor expression in these regions may be involved in the long-term consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and could be used as biomarker of neuronal alteration through the use of imaging techniques in the clinic </plain></SENT>
