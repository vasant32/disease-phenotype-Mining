<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> on postischemic brain injury is mediated by the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) expression and enzymatic activation in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced for 30 min with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic injuries, endogenous IgG exudation, the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophage/microglia, and 5-LOX <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were determined 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5-LOX metabolites (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi>) were measured 3 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> (22.5 and 45 mg/kg, ip, for 3 d) attenuated ischemic injuries, IgG exudation, and the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophage/microglia 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also inhibited 5-LOX expression 72 h after reperfusion and the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> 3 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> inhibited postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001847'>brain inflammation</z:mp>, which might be partly mediated by the inhibition of 5-LOX expression and enzymatic activation </plain></SENT>
