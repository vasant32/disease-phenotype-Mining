<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that citicoline may provide apoptotic pathways following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was produced by distal, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomised into four groups: (B+A) Citicoline 500 mg/kg IP 24 and 1 h before MCAO, and 23 h after MCAO; (A) citicoline 500 mg/kg IP, within 30 min after MCAO, and 23 h after MCAO; (C) vehicle IP; and (D) sham-operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed at 12 h (n=8 per group) and 24 h (n=8 per group) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on free-floating tissue sections with goat polyclonal antibodies to procaspase-1, -2, -3, -6 and -8, and in paraffin-embedded sections processed for cleaved caspase-3 (17 kDa) immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, some sections were stained with the method of in situ end-labelling of nuclear DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, antibodies to poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) products of 89 kDa were used to reveal specific cleavage substrates of caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO induced the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procaspases and the expression of PARP products of 89 kDa, as well as cells with nuclear DNA fragmentation, at 12 and 24 h, in the infarcted core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Citicoline reduced the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procaspases at 12 and 24 h after MCAO, as well as the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in cells in the penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a reduction in the number of cells bearing nuclear DNA fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of caspase-cleaved products of PARP (PARP 89 kDa) was reduced in citicoline-treated ischaemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results show that citicoline inhibits the expression of proteins involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following MCAO </plain></SENT>
