<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of inquiry have indicated that glycine plays an important role in both glutamatergic neurotransmission and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> outcome trials demonstrating the efficacy of glycine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> as neuroprotectants have not been performed with rigorous control of brain temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor glycine recognition site antagonism in a temperature-controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats underwent 75 min of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During MCAO and the first 24 h of reperfusion, rats (n = 10) were administered e55-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-6,7-dichloro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (ACEA 1021) i.v. as a bolus infusion of 5 mg/kg followed by 3.5 mg/kg/h (Low-Dose) or 10 mg/kg followed by 7 mg/kg/ h (High-Dose) for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical temperature was controlled at 38.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C during MCAO and the first 6 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 7-day recovery interval was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by approximately 40% in both high- and low-dose groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preponderance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reduction occurred in the cortex (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function correlated with the size of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurologic grade was similarly improved by treatment with either dose (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that neuroprotection achieved by antagonism of the glycine recognition site persists when brain temperature is controlled, indicating a potent mechanism of action other than attenuating a hyperthermic response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
