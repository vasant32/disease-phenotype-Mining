<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated with beta-aescin for 7 d and then subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 24 h reperfusion, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin (HE) staining, in situ end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) were employed to determine the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in the cortex were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increased numbers of HE- and TUNEL-positive staining cells were significantly observed at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity was inhibited by beta-aescin (30, 60 mg/kg) (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05 vs vehicle-treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After cerebral I/R, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> was released into the cytosol and caspase-3 was activated, whereas Bcl-2 expression was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta-Aescin (30, 60 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the expression of caspase-3 and the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01 vs vehicle-treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: beta-Aescin could potently inhibit caspase-3 activation and the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, increasing the expression of Bcl-2 after cerebral I/R in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings on the inhibitory effects of beta-aescin on brain ischemic injury-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might have important theoretical basis for the treatment on ischemic cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
