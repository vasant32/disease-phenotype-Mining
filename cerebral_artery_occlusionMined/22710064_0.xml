<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to their characterized extracellular roles, we previously reported that elevated intranuclear MMP-2 and -9 (gelatinase) activity degrades nuclear DNA repair proteins and promotes accumulation of oxidative DNA damage in neurons in rat brain at 3-h reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that treatment with a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0003204'>reduced neuronal apoptosis</z:mp> in rat ischemic hemispheres at 48-h reperfusion after a 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since extracellular gelatinases in brain tissue are known to be neurotoxic during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the contribution of intranuclear MMP-2 and -9 activities in neurons to neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To confirm and extend our in vivo observations, oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neurons were subjected to 2-h OGD with reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased intranuclear gelatinase activity was detected immediately after reoxygenation <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and was maximal at 24h, while extracellular gelatinase levels remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected elevated levels of both MMP-2 and -9 in neuronal nuclear extracts and gelatinase activity in neurons co-localized primarily with MMP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a marked decrease in PARP1, XRCC1, and OGG1, and decreased PARP1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of neurons with selective MMP-2/9 inhibitor II significantly decreased gelatinase activity and downregulation of DNA repair enzymes, decreased accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, and promoted neuronal survival after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the nuclear localization of gelatinases and their nuclear substrates observed in an animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, further supporting a novel role for intranuclear gelatinase activity in an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in neurons during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
