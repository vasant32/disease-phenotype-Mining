<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is induced in astrocytes and endothelial cells after ischemic conditions, suggesting that both of these cells synthesize ET-1 under this stress condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ET-1 protected primary cultured astrocytes from ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to further investigate the role of endothelial ET-1 in cerebral ischemic injury, transgenic mouse lines (TET) with a transgene that included ET cDNA with SV40 polyA under tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain (Tie-1) promoter were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TET mouse lines were further characterized for ET-1 over-expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using the primers specific for transgene ET-1 showed that transgene ET-1 is only expressed in the brain from TET mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total expression of ET- 1 mRNA was also increased in the transgenic brain compared with the non-transgenic brain by semi-quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analyses showed that the increased ET-1 mRNA and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> expressions were detected in endothelial cells of cerebral vessels of TET mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, the TET mice that have a slightly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497247,C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">increased blood pressure</z:e> compared with that of non-transgenic mice showed no gross morphological abnormalities in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, TET mice showed a more severe neurological deficit, and larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and volume, suggesting that over-expressing ET-1 in endothelial cells is deleterious to neuronal survival under ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our present TET model will serve as an ideal model for studying the role of endothelial ET- 1 in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
