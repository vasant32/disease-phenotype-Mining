<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16480">nitrosyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbNO) in rat jugular blood by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy during and after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of plasma nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) end products, nitrate plus nitrate, were compared with the levels of HbNO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of HbNO were detected in sham-operated rats (n=4) and those subjected to 2 h of occlusion (n=4), whereas <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> plus nitrate was increased only in the latter (P&lt;0.01; vs.sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon reperfusion after 2 h of occlusion both HbNO and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> plus nitrate clearly increased after 15 min (n=4) and 30 min (n=6) reperfusion (P&lt;0.01; vs.occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (5 mg/kg) significantly increased HbNO (P&lt;0.05) but not plasma nitrate plus nitrate (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in HbNO suppressed by administration of NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (20mg/kg; n=4,P&lt;0.01), and this suppression could be reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study clearly showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-NO synthase pathway was activated during reperfusion after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and indicated the involvement of a reaction between NO and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
