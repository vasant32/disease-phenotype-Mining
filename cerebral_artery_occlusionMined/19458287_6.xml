<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they also contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation during the early hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> by increased transport of Na from blood into brain across an intact <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na-K-Cl cotransporter is stimulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, aglycemia, and AVP and that inhibition of the cotransporter by intravenous bumetanide significantly reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, we found evidence that intravenous cariporide (HOE-642), a highly potent Na/H exchange inhibitor, also reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate which Na/H exchange protein isoforms are present in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> endothelial cells and to evaluate the effects of ischemic factors on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na/H exchange activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of bovine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) and immunoelectron microscopy of perfusion-fixed rat brain revealed that Na/H exchanger isoforms 1 and 2 (NHE1 and NHE2) are present in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using microspectrofluorometry and the pH-sensitive dye BCECF, we found that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, 30 min), aglycemia (30 min), and AVP (1-200 nM, 5 min) significantly increased CMEC Na/H exchange activity, assessed as Na-dependent, HOE-642-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that AVP stimulation of CMEC Na/H exchange activity is dependent on intracellular Ca concentration and is blocked by V(1), but not V(2), vasopressin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis that a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na/H exchanger, possibly NHE1 and/or NHE2, is stimulated during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to participate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
