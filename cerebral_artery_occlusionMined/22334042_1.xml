<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">Folic acid</z:chebi> has been reported to play an important role in neuronal development and reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in primary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">Folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation stimulates Notch signaling and cell proliferation in neural progenitor cells cultured from neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study determined whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation stimulates Notch signaling and neurogenesis and improves cognitive function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham operation plus vehicle (Sham), middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus vehicle (MCAO), MCAO plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (4 mg/(kg day)), and MCAO plus high <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (12 mg/(kg day)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vehicle and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> were administered by oral gavage for 28 days prior to sham or MCAO operation and up to 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Newborn hippocampal neurons were detected at 3, 7, and 14 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function (learning and memory in Y-maze tests) and the protein expression levels of components of the Notch signaling system (Notch1, Hes1, and Hes5) were measured at 7 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MCAO impaired Y-maze performance and stimulated Notch signaling and hippocampal neurogenesis in brain </plain></SENT>
