<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether or not IA-UK thrombolysis has an efficacy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of IA-UK thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, by performing a case-control analysis using data from Japan's Multicenter <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Investigator's Collaboration (J-MUSIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 16,922 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients were enrolled into J-MUSIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these patients, we selected 91 patients (UK group) who met the following criteria: treatment with IA-UK; 20-75 years of age; cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; presenting with a carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; admission within 4.5 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of 5-22 points on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group of 182 patients without IA-UK treatment and matched to the NIHSS score, gender, and age was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge and the mortality between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, the mean age was 65 +/- 8 years, and the median NIHSS score was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and UK administration was 3.4 +/- 1.3 h, and the IA-UK dose was 392,000 +/- 200,000 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mRS score at discharge was lower in the UK group than in the control group (mean, SD, median; 2.8, 2.9, 2 in UK group vs. 3.3, 1.8, 4, in the control, respectively p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome (mRS of 0-2) was more frequently observed in the UK group (50.5%) than in the control group (34.1%, p = 0.0124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference in the mortality rate was seen between the UK group (11.0%) and the control group (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As well, there was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the UK group (46 +/- 41 days, mean +/- SD) and the control group (42 +/- 42 days, mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IA-UK thrombolytic therapy may improve the outcome in hyperacute cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
