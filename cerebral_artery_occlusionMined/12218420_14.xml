<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory ipsilateral to the occluded artery was determined on the basis of two different methodologies: cerebral blood flow (CBF) percent change obtained quantitatively from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 (133Xe) SPECT, and asymmetry index (AI) percent change obtained qualitatively from N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients with unilateral internal carotid artery or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were divided into two groups within each SPECT methodology (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or decreased CBF percent change and AI percent change) and followed up for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative recurrence-free survival rates for patients with decreased CBF percent change were significantly lower than for those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF percent change (P = 0.0205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in cumulative recurrence-free survival rates between patients with decreased AI percent change and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AI percent change </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that decreased cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> determined quantitatively by 133Xe SPECT is an independent predictor of the 5-year risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and that the qualitative method using 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT is a poor predictor of the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this type of patient </plain></SENT>
