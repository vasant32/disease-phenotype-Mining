<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medic (TFA) is the major active component isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Abelmoschus manihot L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the protective effect of TFA against poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) injury in mice and its action mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mouse model of PSD was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MACO) 30 min/reperfusion, followed by isolation feeding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unpredictable mild stress for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment groups received TFA at three different doses (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> (Flu, 2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in behavior, brain tissue malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels, and the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected by immunohistochemistry, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of BDNF and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TFA (160, 80, and 40 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated mice escape-directed behavioral impairment induced by PSD, markedly reduced <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, and increased the activity of SOD, GSH-Px close to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TFA administration also attenuated PSD-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/losses, upregulated expression of BDNF both at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, as well as CREB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TFA had a protective effect against PSD injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardioprotection involves the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and upregulation of BDNF-CREB levels in the hippocampus, which may also be important mechanism of its antidepressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This potential protection makes TFA a promising therapeutic agent for the PSD </plain></SENT>
