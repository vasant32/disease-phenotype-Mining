<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that is activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, translocates to the nucleus, and induces the transcription of neuroprotective genes, such as bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> increases STAT3 activation in female rat brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and whether STAT3 activation contributes to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ovariectomized (OVX) female rats with and without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3) and total STAT3 (T-STAT3) were quantified by Western blot analysis at 3 and 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STAT3 activation was colocalized with neuronal and survival markers microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Bcl-2 using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was measured at 22 h after MCAO in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-treated OVX animals in the presence and absence of STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin I (JSI-124) using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> increased P-STAT3 in the ischemic cortex cytosolic fraction at 3 h after MCAO without affecting T-STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with increased P-STAT3 in the nuclear fraction, which remained elevated at 22 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nuclear P-STAT3 colocalized with MAP2 and Bcl-2 within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The P-STAT3 inhibitor JSI-124 abolished the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> without affecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in untreated OVX rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> increases STAT3 phosphorylation in neurons after MCAO and that STAT3 activation plays an important role in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
