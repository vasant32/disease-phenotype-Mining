<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediction of functional outcome immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> can guide optimal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most prognostic grading scales to date, however, have been based on established global metrics such as total NIHSS score, admission <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, or intracranial occlusion on CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to construct a more focused, location-weighted multivariate model for the prediction of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> improvement, based not only on traditional clinical and imaging parameters, but also on atlas-based structure/function correlation specific to the clinical deficit, using CT perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> due to first-time <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of the left hemisphere were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Language function was assessed on the basis of the patients admission and discharge NIHSS scores and clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had brain <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> and CTA within 9 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For image analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTPs</z:chebi> were automatically co-registered to MNI-152 brain space and parcellated into mirrored cortical and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to find independent imaging and clinical predictors of language recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the time of discharge, 21 (36%) patients demonstrated improvement of language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent factors predicting improvement in language included rCBF of the angular gyrus GM (BA 39) and the lower third of the insular ribbon, proximal cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on admission CTA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> score on the admission NIHSS examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using these 4 variables, we developed a multivariate logistic regression model that could estimate the probability of early improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and predict functional outcome with 91% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An imaging-based location-weighted multivariate model was developed to predict early language improvement of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> by using admission data collected within 9 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This pilot model should be validated in a larger, prospective study; however, the semiautomated atlas-based analysis of brain <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>, along with the statistical approach, could be generalized for prediction of other outcome measures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
