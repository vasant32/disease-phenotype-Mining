<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative roles of the two group I subtypes, mGluR1 or mGluR5, in such injury has not been well examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of treatment with the newly developed, selective mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-phenylethynylpyridine (MPEP) and the selective mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) in a rat intraluminal filament model of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered MPEP or CHPG i.c.v. beginning 15 or 135 min after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was measured after either 22 or 70 h of reperfusion, and neurological function was quantified at 2, 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with MPEP or CHPG at 15 min reduced 24 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 61 and 44%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects were dose dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delaying MPEP treatment until 135 min eliminated the neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In other studies, using early MPEP treatment (15 min) at optimal doses, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by 44% at 72 h and this was correlated with significant neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that both MPEP and CHPG are neuroprotective when administered after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In separate, recent studies we found that although MPEP does act as an mGluR5 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and blocks <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> hydrolysis, it also serves as a non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>; in contrast, other results indicate that CHPG mediated neuroprotection may reflect anti-apoptotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both types of compounds may prove to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
