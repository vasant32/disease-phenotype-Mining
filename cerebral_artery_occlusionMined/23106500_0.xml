<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is proved to display potent cerebroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little information is available about the link between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether SAA exhibits its protective effects in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) through sEH and EETs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SAA treatment ameliorated neurological deficits and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, the beneficial effects of SAA were attenuated by co-administration of (14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE)), a putative selective EETs <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SAA increased the 14,15-EET levels in the blood and brain of sham and MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assay for hydrolase activity showed that 1 and 3 mg/kg of SAA significantly diminished brain sEH activity of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A fluorescent assay in vitro indicated that SAA could inhibit recombinant human sEH activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 1.62 μmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SAA at the doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly decreased sEH protein expression in hippocampus CA1 region of MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cerebral protection of SAA is mediated, at least in part, via inhibiting sEH to increase EETs levels </plain></SENT>
