<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study investigates which compound group is most effective, to establish the key compound groups for quality assessment, especially in terms of neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The roots of P. cuspidatum were extracted with 85% <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> and fractionated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="29021">hexane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi>, n-butanol and water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each fraction was applied to an in vitro radical scavenging assay, a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation assay in brain homogenates and an in vivo assay using a transient focal cerebra <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a Sprague-Dawley rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> fraction was the most effective fraction in both in vitro and in vivo assays, having the highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22580">anthraquinone</z:chebi> contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbenes</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22580">anthraquinones</z:chebi> may be key compound groups for the quality assessment of the anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects of P. cuspidatum </plain></SENT>
