<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the behavioral and histologic efficacy of such bone marrow stromal cell-derived neuronal cell (MSDNC) transplantation into a focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed on adult Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSDNC transplantation into the ipsilateral hemisphere was performed on day 7 after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The behavioral analyses were conducted on days 14, 21, 28, 35, and 36-40, and a histologic evaluation was performed on day 41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSDNC-transplanted rats showed significant recovery compared with controls (MCAO without cell transplantation) in beam balance, limb placing, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, transplanted cells migrated from the injection site into the ischemic boundary area, including the cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplanted MSDNCs were positive for MAP-2 (84% +/- 8.11%), whereas only a small number of cells were positive for GFAP (1.0% +/- 0.23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rates of MSDNCs and MSCs 1 month after transplantation were approximately 45% and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that use of MSDNCs may be a promising therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
