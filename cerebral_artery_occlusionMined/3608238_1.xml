<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a lowering of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) content of basal ganglia after 4 and 12 h of occlusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the progress of time the <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> content was increased above that of sham controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homovanillic acid (HVA) content was decreased significantly at 12 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reflow, the HVA content of the right basal ganglia was higher than that of sham controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reflow restored the level of DOPAC to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 1 h after removal of clip </plain></SENT>
