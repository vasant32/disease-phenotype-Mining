<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy is used for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> after failed intravenous thrombolysis or in patients not eligible for thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With increasing experience, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reocclusion has been described and likely worsens clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the rates and outcomes of delayed symptomatic reocclusion after endovascular therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> undergoing endovascular procedures at out institutions from January 2008 to August 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 107 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> interventions were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (3.5%) experienced delayed symptomatic reocclusion detectable by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 4 patients (age 45-79 years) had baseline NIHSS score ranging from 8 to 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three had right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and one had a left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> score 2-3) occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients improved postprocedure (NIHSS score 5-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical deterioration (NIHSS score 14-22) occurred 12 to 18 hours postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was achieved in each patient, with improvement in NIHSS score (range 6-13) but not to a lower level compared with after the initial intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delayed symptomatic reocclusion after initial endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy can lead to sudden clinical deterioration and impact outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The entity may be missed as many patients present with large clinical deficits at presentation thus requiring careful assessments of patients treated via endovascular methods </plain></SENT>
