<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a cDNA microarray technology was used to analyze the gene expression profile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in electroacupuncture (EA)-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major altered genes were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In EA-treated monkeys, approximately 10% of the total number of genes examined were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No expression changes were observed in cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the protective mechanisms of EA against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include several related pathways and gene expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis may provide a framework for understanding these complicated mechanisms and yield valuable, clinically relevant insights and potentially therapeutic targets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
