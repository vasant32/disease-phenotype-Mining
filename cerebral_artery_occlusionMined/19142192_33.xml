<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotides long, noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that control cellular function by either degrading <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> or arresting their translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand their functional significance in ischemic pathophysiology, we profiled miRNAs in adult rat brain as a function of reperfusion time after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 238 miRNAs evaluated, 8 showed increased and 12 showed decreased expression at least at 4 out of 5 reperfusion time points studied between 3 h and 3 days compared with sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those, 17 showed &gt;5 fold change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis indicated a correlation between miRNAs altered to several <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> known to mediate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, transcription, neuroprotection, receptors function, and ionic homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antagomir-mediated prevention of mir-145 expression led to an increased protein expression of its downstream target <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase-2 in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis showed sequence complementarity of eight miRNAs induced after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 877 promoters indicating the possibility of noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-induced activation of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the RNases Drosha and Dicer, cofactor Pasha, and the pre-miRNA transporter exportin-5, which modulate miRNA biogenesis, were not altered after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present studies indicate a critical role of miRNAs in controlling <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription and translation in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
