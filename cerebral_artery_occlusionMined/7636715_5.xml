<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are divergent conclusions concerning their efficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These discrepancies may be due to the different experimental conditions and/or rat strains used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we have assessed in five commonly used rat strains, under identical experimental conditions, the ability of one representative of each of these drug classes to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drugs or corresponding vehicle were injected immediately after permanent unilateral MCAO and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined 48 hr later by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated controls, the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was strain-dependent (range, 70-200 microliters), primarily due to variations in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction (up to 65%) elicited by the three drugs also was strain-dependent, the main effect and variation being observed in the cortex (range, 0-83% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in efficiency was seen between the competitive and noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, whereas the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> showed better results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential to reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the rat MCAO model with calcium or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> depends upon the strain used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The exact reasons and mechanisms are presently not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such knowledge would certainly add to the confidence in this model and would allow more accurate predictions concerning the clinical efficacy of drugs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
