<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the literature about the CBF changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied CBF in 68 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease within 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> from February 1984 through February 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by a rapidly rotating single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using non-invasive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our subjects included 51 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (male 37, female 14, average 62.9 years) and 17 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (male 13, female 4, average 60.5 years), the patients who had a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded from the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SPECT was performed with use of Tomomatic 64 developed by Dr. Lassen, et al, SPECT and carotid arteriography were simultaneously performed within 48 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT we used were GE CT 9800 scanner and Hitachi HF CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following results have been obtained: 1) SPECT clearly showed an ischemic focus correlated with clinical symptom after the attack rather than CT, the positive finding by SPECT was 92.2% and that by CT was 62.7% within 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2) The remote effect phenomenon so-called crossed cerebellar diaschisis was demonstrated in 7 of 14 cases (50%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and in 9 of 26 cases (34.6%) with that due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3) SPECT and CT were performed within 8 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 20 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed decreased CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases whereas the positive finding by CT was 40.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The area of decreased CBF was always larger than the low density area that CT demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean CBF value of the cerebral hemisphere in the cases with ICA occlusion within 8 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> was 31.0 (ml/100 g/min), and that of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was 36.0 (ml/100 g/min), and that of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was 36.0 (ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4) The positive finding by SPECT on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> cases was 47% and that by CT was 41.1%, SPECT usually did not demonstrate a small ischemic focus especially at the deep region (ie, basal ganglia region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>5) SPECT using Xe-123 inhalation was useful and non-invasive method for the diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
