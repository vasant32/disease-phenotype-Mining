<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) first was described with reference to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in cultured astrocytes subjected to dense <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently its transcript was found in macrophages within human aortic atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a role in protecting cells under hypoxic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, we aimed to elucidate the constitutive cellular localization in vivo of ORP150 in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system as well as the sequential alteration in its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression during this severe ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that ORP150 protein normally is present predominantly in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 78-kDa <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein, which is another well-known stress protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, also was stained in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ORP150 antigenicity was markedly enhanced in severely damaged neurons, while the amount of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preceding this change, orp150 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was selectively induced in neurons undergoing postischemic cytoskeletal proteolysis, as early as 1 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that ORP150 might be regulated by transcriptional level as for many stress proteins, but unlike previously described other stress proteins it was translated in the center of ischemic lesions despite nearly complete energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the biological potentials of ORP150 protein in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in vivo will also be discussed </plain></SENT>
