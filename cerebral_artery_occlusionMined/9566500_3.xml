<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed at the investigation of the rat corticospinal system both functionally and anatomically using as a functional marker the immediate early gene c-fos, combined with retrograde tracing with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by mapping c-fos induction immunocytochemically in the spinal cord as a result of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following left-sided <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) was localized in both the dorsal and ventral horn neurons at the lumbar segment of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Labelling was often bilateral but was generally more substantial ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ventral horn, some of the Fos-positive neurons were confirmed to be somatic motoneurons innervating the tibialis anterior muscle of the lower extremity contralateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, as shown by their retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidase injected into the muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fos-LI was absent in the ventral horn of the spinal cord at cervical, thoracic, and sacral segments in both experimental and sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the expression of c-fos may be used as a sensitive transneuronal marker for the study of neuronal activity in the spinal cord elicited by brain damage, viz. focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, and when coupled with injection of HRP as a retrograde tracer, the method may prove to be useful for the study of transneuronal effect of the damage of the corticospinal motor system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the expression of c-fos in the spinal motoneurons was most probably attributable to transneuronal effect following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the possibility of that c-fos can be induced by altered hindlimb activity after the cerebral ischaemic insult cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
