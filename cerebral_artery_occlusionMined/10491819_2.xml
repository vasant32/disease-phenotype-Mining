<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its application in rats has resulted in inconsistent infarction volumes which involve only the subcortex or subcortex plus some cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to eliminate this drawback, we applied the intraluminal suture occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to gerbils that have an incomplete Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced by inserting an endovascular 5-0 nylon suture with a blunted tip into the Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into two groups: permanent MCAO for 24 h (n = 8) and transient MCAO for 3 h with 21 h reperfusion (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corrected infarction volume in the permanent MCAO group was 232 +/- 37 mm3 whereas it was 230 +/- 45 mm3 in the transient MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals in both groups had infarction in both cortex and subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of this study show that endovascular suture occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> can be easily applied in gerbils to obtain consistent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would allow both transient and permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to be tested in the same model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
