<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the role of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthetase (eNOS) and a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) donor, (Z)-1-[N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) amino] diazen-1-ium-1, 2-diolate (DETA-NONOate), in promoting arteriogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT, n=18) and eNOS-knockout (eNOS(-/-), n=36) mice were subjected to transient (2.5 h) right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and were treated with or without DETA-NONOate (0.4 mg/kg) 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional evaluation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 3 days after MCAo for arterial cell culture studies, or 14 days for immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous studies, eNOS(-/-) mice exhibited a higher mortality rate (P&lt;0.05, n=18/group) and more severe neurological functional deficit after MCAo than WT mice (P&lt;0.05, n=12/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased arteriogenesis, was evident in eNOS(-/-) mice compared with WT mice, as demonstrated by reduced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, arterial density and diameter in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>eNOS(-/-) mice treated with DETA-NONOate had a significantly decreased mortality rate and improved functional recovery, and exhibited enhanced arteriogenesis identified by increased VSMC proliferation, and upregulated arterial density and diameter compared to eNOS(-/-) mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05, n=12/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms underlying eNOS/NO mediated arteriogenesis, VSMC migration was measured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial cell migration significantly decreased in the cultured common carotid artery (CCA) derived from eNOS(-/-) mice 3 days after MCAo compared to WT arterial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DETA-NONOate-treatment significantly attenuated eNOS(-/-)-induced decrease of arterial cell migration compared to eNOS(-/-) control artery (P&lt;0.05; n=6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using VSMC culture, DETA-NONOate significantly increased VSMC migration, while inhibition of NOS significantly decreased VSMC migration (P&lt;0.05; n=6/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that eNOS not only promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular dilation</z:e> but also increases VSMC proliferation and migration, and thereby enhances arteriogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, increase eNOS may play an important role in regulating of arteriogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
