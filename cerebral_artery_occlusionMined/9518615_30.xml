<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of P- or E-selectin was not observed in brain tissue of sham operated control rats (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P-selectin immunoreactivity was detected as early as 15 min and decreased to control level at 1 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-selectin then slightly increased at 2 h and peaked at 6 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E-selectin immunoreactivity was first observed at 2 h and peaked at 6 h and 12 h of after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P- and E-selectin immunoreactivity was colocalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor immunoreactive microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>90.4+/-2.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels expressing P-selectin immunoreactivity were 7.5 to 30.0 micron in diameter; 3.6+/-1.4% were contained in vessels smaller than 7.5 micron, and 6.0+/-1.8% were localized in vessels greater than 30.0 micron in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percent distribution of E-selectin immunoreactive vessels were 75.9+/-2.1% in vessels 7.5 to 30.0 micron in diameter; 23.6+/-2.2% were in vessels smaller than 7.5 micron, and 0.6+/-0.4% were localized in vessels greater than 30.0 micron in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the temporal profiles of P- and E-selectin expression are independent of these models of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and are consistent with the time course of selectin mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
