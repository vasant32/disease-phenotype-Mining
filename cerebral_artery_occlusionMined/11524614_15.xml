<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, the authors examined whether transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) was protective in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and whether alteration of cerebral circulation was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received intraventricular TGF-alpha (50 ng, either split into 2 doses given 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), or 1 dose given 30 minutes after MCAO) or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 1-hour intraluminal MCAO and cerebral blood flow was recorded continuously by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured 1 and 4 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of TGF-alpha on arterial tone were assessed in isolated rabbit basilar and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-alpha before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 70% at 1 day and 50% at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-alpha given only after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also did reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 70% at 1 day and 80% at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was more marked in cortex than in striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-alpha did not change cortical microvascular perfusion and did not modify arterial passive tone nor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-induced active tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that TGF-alpha reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, even when the factor is exclusively administered at reperfusion, and that this effect is not mediated by changes in microvascular perfusion or cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is therefore suggested that TGF-alpha has a protective effect against neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
