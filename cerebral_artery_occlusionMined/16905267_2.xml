<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was examined whether reactivation of this regulatory system using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> could improve detrusor overactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities after MCAO were assayed to assess the damage to cholinergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ChAT activities in the bilateral cortex, hippocampus, and pons were calculated by measuring the conversion of 1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects on cystometrography of i.v. or i.c.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4696">donepezil hydrochloride</z:chebi> (DON), a centrally acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, were investigated in conscious sham-operated (SO) and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether DON in the forebrain was affected, we decerebrated rats after CI or SO, and investigated the effects on cystometrography of i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity was markedly decreased after MCAO, and remained below half of the pre-occlusion capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase in bladder capacity was attained at 1.2 x 10(-2) nM/kg of DON given i.v., with a change of 52.8% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases of i.c.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DON, the greatest increase in bladder capacity was at the dose of 6 x 10(-2) pmol with the change of 95.8% (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The activity of ChAT was decreased in the left cortex and hippocampus 24 h after MCAO (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In decerebrated rats, low dose of DON did not change micturition parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that by upregulation of the forebrain muscarinic inhibitory mechanism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> improves detrusor overactivity by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
