<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, "total mismatch," negative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and extensive perfusion defects were introduced and described as having a favorable outcome after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with total mismatch and describe their clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed subjects from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients between August 2008 and October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with the following characteristics were included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the anterior circulation and a negative DWI but large perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) lesion on mean transit time maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> imaging protocol, the patients underwent emergent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging immediately after admission and follow-up imaging within 96 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were identified as suitable for the imaging criteria (negative DWI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> delay) of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with a spontaneous recovery of ischemic symptoms related to the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had a potential source of cardioembolism and eventually developed new lesions on follow-up DWI and recanalization without thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, total mismatch seems to suggest favorable outcome after recanalization, regardless of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further attention should be focused on the considerable variations in PWI and DWI findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
