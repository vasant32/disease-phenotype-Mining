<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> is known to provide neuroprotection from focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lethal cardiovascular complications resulting from total body cooling have greatly restricted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as a therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether selective cerebral cooling induced after reversible cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> would decrease the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under general anesthesia, 8 baboons were subjected to 1-hour simultaneous occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and anterior cerebral arteries by transorbital surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four animals were treated with selective cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to 25°C, initiated 2.5 hours after placement of cerebral artery clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was achieved, after heparinization, by continuous withdrawal of femoral arterial blood into an extracorporeal closed-circuit pump system, cooling by water bath and perfusion into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pump flow was adjusted to maintain right internal carotid artery pressure near systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cortical temperature was maintained below 27°C for 12 hours, whereas systemic temperature was preserved near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by convective air mattresses and warm water blankets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four control animals were maintained at 36°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, pH, and blood gases were maintained at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight to 72 hours after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were obtained and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Normothermic baboons had infarction of 35.4±4.4% (mean±SD) of the left cerebral hemisphere compared with 0.5±1% for baboons treated with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In brain-cooled animals, esophageal temperature was maintained greater than 34°C, despite cerebral temperature less than 27°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective brain cooling initiated 2.5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, without cardiovascular derangement </plain></SENT>
