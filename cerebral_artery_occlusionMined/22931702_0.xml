<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The current study explored the effects of treadmill exercise intensity on functional recovery and hippocampal phospho-NR2B (p-NR2B) expression in cerebral ischemic rats, induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, including sham, no exercise (NE), low intensity training (LIT, v = 15 m/min), and moderate intensity training groups (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>, v = 20 m/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At different time points, the hippocampal expressions of p-NR2B and total NR2B were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, neurological deficit score (NDS), body weight, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining were used to evaluate brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as assessments of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the effect of exercise on survival, the mortality rate was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that treadmill exercise significantly decreased hippocampal expression of p-NR2B but didn't change the total NR2B, compared to the NE group on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days following MCAO surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect on changes in p-NR2B levels, body weight, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were more significant in the LIT compared to the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current findings demonstrate that physical exercise can produce neuroprotective effects, in part by down-regulating p-NR2B expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the appropriate intensity of physical exercise is critical for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
