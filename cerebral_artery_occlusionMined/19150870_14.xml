<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with recombinant human erythropoietin intraperitoneally at a dose of 5000 U/kg of body weight (n=11) or the same volume of saline (n=7) daily for 7 days starting 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements of T2- and diffusion-weighted images and cerebral blood flow were performed and neurological severity score was assessed at 1 day and weekly for 6 weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Luxol fast blue and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> staining were used to demonstrate myelin and axons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: White matter reorganization occurred along the ischemic lesion boundary after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The region of white matter reorganization seen on the tissue slice coincided with the elevated area on the fractional anisotropy map, which can be accurately identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in elevated fractional anisotropy pixels corresponded with progress of white matter reorganization and was associated with improvement of neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly enhanced white matter reorganization, restored local cerebral blood flow, and expedited functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: White matter reorganization can be detected by fractional anisotropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated fractional anisotropy pixels may be a good MRI index to stage white matter remodeling and predict functional outcome </plain></SENT>
