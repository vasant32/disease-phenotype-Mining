<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that FK506 inhibits the signaling pathways that regulate hypertrophic/proliferative responses in cultured astrocytes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we sought to determine whether FK506 neuroprotection after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rat is mediated via suppression of glia activation and changes in cytokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and astrocyte/microglial response were quantified in rats subjected to 90 min of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in ipsilateral and contralateral cortices were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FK506 administered at 1 mg/kg, 60 min after MCAo, produced a significant improvement in neurological function and reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In FK506-treated rats, a significant reduction of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression was observed 12 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FK506 neuroprotection was associated with a significant downregulation of IL-1beta expression in astrocytes and microglia in the injured side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FK506 selectively decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in astrocytes in vitro, with no effect on transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) and IL-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FK506 inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced activation and cytokine expression in microglia in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that astrocytes and microglia are targets for FK506, and that modulation of glial response and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may be a mechanism of FK506-mediated neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
