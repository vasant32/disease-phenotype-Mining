<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Crayfish neurons were pretreated with vehicle or the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37830">pentane</z:chebi> extract from Maca, subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>, and their viability determined microscopically and chemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant concentration-neuroprotective effect relationship was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37830">pentane</z:chebi> extract was then administered intravenously to rats prior to and following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were decreased for the lower dose, higher doses increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a potential application of Maca as a neuroprotectant </plain></SENT>
