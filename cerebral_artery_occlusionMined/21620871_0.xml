<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether the transplantation of MSCs combined with FK506, a clinically used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi>, enhanced neuroprotective effects in rat experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient 90 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two or 6h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the rats were randomly assigned to receive intravenous administration of MSCs plus FK506, MSCs alone, FK506 alone, or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, and neurological and immunohistological assessments were performed to examine the effects of these therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: In 2-hour post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> treatment groups, significant improvement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological scores were observed 1 day after combination therapy compared with monotherapy, and this neuroprotection continued for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, increased Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression, and suppressed neutrophil infiltration and microglia/macrophage activation compared to monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6-hour post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> treatment groups, a significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> index, and neurological score was observed only in the combination therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of engrafted MSCs on day 7 with combination therapy was significantly higher than with MSCs alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Combination therapy using FK506 enhanced the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs and increased the survival of transplanted cells, leading to expansion of the therapeutic time window for MSCs </plain></SENT>
