<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Observations in human interventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment led us to hypothesize that iodinated radiographic contrast material use may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of intra-arterial iodinated radiographic contrast material on hemorrhagic transformation after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion were studied in a placebo-controlled, blinded preclinical study in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: saline group (n=8), contrast group (n=12), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (n=9), and contrast+<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 5 hours using suture placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was infused before suture removal and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saline and/or contrast were infused immediately during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence, location, and size of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were determined by brain necropsy inspection at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant increase in incidence of cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from control (37.5%), contrast (75.0%), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (77.8%) to contrast+<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (100%; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel correlation, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both pooled contrast groups (85.7%) and pooled <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> groups (88.9%) had higher rates of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar trends for increased cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were seen in the contrast-only (P=0.18) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-only (P=0.18) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in rats receiving contrast versus those without (P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial iodinated radiographic contrast material may increase cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, similar to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Iodinated radiographic contrast material effect may be additive to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> effect on the incidence of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
