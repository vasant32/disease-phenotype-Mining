<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined at 24 h after MCAo by measuring 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-negative stained area of the serial brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic treatment of AJ-3941 (3 mg/kg p.o.), 10 min and 3 h after the insult, significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 44-80%, compared to vehicle control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reducing effect was observed both in the cortical and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days after MCAo, contents of water and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral hemisphere significantly increased comparing with those in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic treatment with AJ-3941 (3 and 10 mg/kg twice daily p.o. for 2 days) markedly inhibited the increase in water content and suppressed the increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, these contents showed no significant differences between vehicle-treated group and either control (non-operated) or AJ-3941-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AJ-3941 had only minimum effect on body temperature and physiological parameters, such as blood pressure, blood gases and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, even when the maximum dose used (10 mg/kg) was repeatedly administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that post-ischemic treatment with AJ-3941 may ameliorate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and they also suggest that AJ-3941 has a beneficial effect in the treatment of ischemic cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
