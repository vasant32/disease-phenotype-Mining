<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the impact of the speed of recanalization on the evolution of diffusion- weighted imaging (DWI) lesions and outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 113 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who were treated with intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging studies, including DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging before and 36 to 48 hours after administration of a tPA bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were continuously monitored with transcranial Doppler during the first 2 hours after tPA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pattern of recanalization on transcranial Doppler was defined as sudden (&lt;1 minute), stepwise (1 to 29 minutes), or slow (&gt;30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During transcranial Doppler monitoring, 13 (12.3%) patients recanalized suddenly, 32 (30.2%) recanalized in a stepwise manner, and 18 (17%) recanalized slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical and imaging parameters were similar among recanalization subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 36 to 48 hours, DWI lesion growth was significantly (P=0.001) smaller after sudden (3.23+/-10.5 cm(3)) compared with stepwise (24.9+/-37 cm(3)), slow (46.3+/-38 cm(3)), and no (51.7+/-34 cm(3)) recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The slow pattern was associated with greater DWI growth (P=0.003), lesser degree of clinical improvement (P=0.021), worse 3-month outcome (P=0.032), and higher mortality (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The speed of tPA-induced clot lysis predicts DWI lesion evolution and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike sudden and stepwise patterns, slow recanalization is associated with greater DWI lesion growth and poorer short- and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
