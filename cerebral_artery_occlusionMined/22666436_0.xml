<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms responsible for increasing iron and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> are an interesting area of research which could open new therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence has shown that activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through RelA acetylation on Lys310 is the prerequisite for p50/RelA-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cellular and animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the increase of iron through a NF-κB-regulated 1B isoform of the divalent metal transporter-1 (1B/DMT1) might contribute to post-ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and in neuronally differentiated SK-N-SH cells exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-deprivation (OGD), 1A/DMT1 was only barely expressed while the 1B/DMT1 without iron-response-element (-IRE) protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were early up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either OGD or over-expression of 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 isoform significantly increased iron uptake, as detected by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, and iron-dependent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Iron chelation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> treatment or (-)IRE DMT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> silencing displayed significant neuroprotection against OGD which concomitantly decreased intracellular iron levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found evidence that 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 was a target gene for RelA activation and acetylation on Lys310 residue during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the 1B/DMT1 promoter showed there was increased interaction with RelA and acetylation of H3 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> during OGD exposure of cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> RelA increased 1B/DMT1 promoter-luciferase activity, the (-)IRE DMT1 protein, as well as neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of the acetylation-resistant RelA-K310R construct, which carried a mutation from lysine 310 to arginine, but not the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-mimic mutant RelA-K310Q, down-regulated the 1B/DMT1 promoter, consequently offering neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 expression and intracellular iron influx are early downstream responses to NF-κB/RelA activation and acetylation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
