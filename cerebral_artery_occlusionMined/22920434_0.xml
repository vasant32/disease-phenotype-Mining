<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM MNC) have been effectively used to treat experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the preclinical trials have been performed in young and healthy laboratory animals, even though age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the influence of age on the properties of BM MNCs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we compared the efficacy of aged and young BM MNC in an in vitro model of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and in an adapted in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human BM MNCs were obtained from healthy young or aged donors and either co-cultured with rat hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), or transplanted intravenously 24 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in aged (18 months) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was examined by quantification of hippocampal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or respectively, by neurofunctional tests and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-cultivation with young, but not with aged BM MNCs significantly reduced the hippocampal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of both young and old BM MNCs did not reduce functional deficits or ischemic lesion volume after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a significant impact of age on the therapeutic efficacy of BM MNCs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
