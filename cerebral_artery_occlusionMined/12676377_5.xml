<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the in vivo neuroprotective effect of NS-7 in a rat transient focal ischemic model when administered during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 120 min using an intraluminal thread method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats received a single intravenous injection of NS-7 or saline (control group) just after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and at 30, 60 and 120 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their brains were removed after 48 h reperfusion, sectioned, and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were evaluated by neurological examination at 120 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 48 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarcted cortex and striatum were measured quantitatively and infarction volumes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction volumes were 128+/-74 (NS-7) and 214+/-64 mm(3) (control) immediately after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, 155+/-48 (NS-7) and 225+/-12 mm(3) (control) after the 30 min group, 160+/-54 (NS-7) and 225+/-48 mm(3) (control) after the 60 min group, and 176+/-43 (NS-7) and 223+/-38 mm(3) (control) after the 120 min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortices in NS-7-treated groups were significantly less infarcted than in control groups at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the striatal infarction volume between the treatment and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001504'>abnormal posture</z:mp> of the NS-7 groups were significantly more improved at 48 h reperfusion than those of the control groups without posture examination in the 120 min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that NS-7 may be a new potential therapeutic agent for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
