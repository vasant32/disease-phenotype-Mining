<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effects of treatment with a single dose or sustained infusion of the redox-modulating MnPorphyrin Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) on outcome from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normothermic rats were subjected to 90 min MCAO followed by 90 min reperfusion and then were treated with a single intracerebroventricular dose of Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic and histologic outcomes were assessed at 1 or 8 weeks postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single dose of Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) caused a dose-dependent improvement in histologic and neurologic outcome when assessed 1 week postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) afforded preservation of brain aconitase activity at 5.5 h after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, consistent with its known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) also attenuated postischemic NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a 1-week continuous intracerebroventricular Mn(III)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>-2-ImP(5+) infusion caused persistent and substantive reduction in both cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurologic deficit at 8 weeks postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic modulation of postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is likely to require sustained intervention for enduring efficacy in improving neurologic and histologic outcome from a transient focal ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
