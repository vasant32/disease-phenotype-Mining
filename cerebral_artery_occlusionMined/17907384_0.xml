<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe changes of contents of excitatory amino acids in focal cerebral ischemic tissue after electroacupuncture (EA) treatment at different time courses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion (CI/R) rats so as to provide experimental evidence for selecting the best duration of EA stimulation in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty SD rats were randomized into control, model, EA-10 min, EA-30 min and EA-60 min groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI/R model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (2 Hz, 3.5 mA and continuous waves) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26) for 10 min, 30 min and 60 min respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) concentrations were detected by using an amino acid automatic analyzer after homogenate and centrifugalization of the right brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control group, Asp and Glu contents of model group and EA-10 min group increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01); while in comparison with model group, Asp level in EA-60 min group, and Glu level in EA-10 min, EA-30 min and EA-60 min groups decreased considerably (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between control and EA-30 min groups, and between control and EA-60 min groups in Asp and Glu levels (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA of GV20 and GV26 for 60 min can markedly reduce Glu and Asp levels in the topical cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in CI/R rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suitable duration of EA stimulation is definitely necessary for inducing a better therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
