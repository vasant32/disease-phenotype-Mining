<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study focuses on the temporal calcium significance in middle cerebral artery occluded (2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>)-reperfused (70 h reperfusion) rats treated with nimodipine (NM) through concurrent measurements of excitotoxicity, bioenergetics and neurobehavioural paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, the suitable therapeutic time window of calcium channel antagonism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was also ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NM (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered at pre (30 min before the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), during (1 h following occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and post-ischemic (3 h after begin of reperfusion) states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of neuroprotection in terms of excitotoxicity (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase, Na(+)K(+)ATPase), bioenergetics (ATP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15846">NAD(+)</z:chebi>) and neurobehavioural paradigms (neurological score and open field exploratory behaviour) were measured and compared to ensure the therapeutic time-window of NM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-reperfusion (MCAO/R) was found to elevate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glutamine synthetase levels and deplete Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity in the vehicle treated group (IR group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease in bioenergetics such as ATP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15846">NAD(+)</z:chebi> levels was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, IR group demonstrated grievous <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content, <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate levels and decrease in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels) along with anxiogenic behaviour, neurological deficits and neuronal damage and decreased nuclear to cytoplasm ratio in CA1 hippocampal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic NM administration reversed the excitotoxicity, neurobehavioural and histopathological alterations significantly, but it restored bioenergetics level in MCAO/R rats only partially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were further confirmed with the combination treatment (CT) of post-ischemic NM and pre-ischemic memantine (MN) administration, since MN showed protective effect in the pre-ischemic administration (Babu and Ramanathan, 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The failure of NM to forefend the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> on pre- and during-ischemic administration suggests that the initial phase damages in ischemic-reperfusion (IR) might be mediated through other mechanism(s) such as glutamergic overstimulation or reverse operation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the present study, it is concluded that calcium plays a crucial role in post-ischemic status and the suitable therapeutic time window of calcium antagonism is the post-ischemic state </plain></SENT>
