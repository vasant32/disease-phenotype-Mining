<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Xanthohumol is the principal prenylated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> in hops (Humulus lupulus L.), an ingredient of beer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Xanthohumol was found to be a potent chemopreventive agent; however, no data are available concerning its neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the neuroprotective activity and mechanisms of xanthohumol in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with xanthohumol (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) 10 min before MCAO dose-dependently attenuated focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and improved neurobehavioral deficits in cerebral ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Xanthohumol treatment produced a marked reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared to that in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO-induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was associated with increases in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), and active caspase-3 protein expressions in ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These expressions were obviously inhibited by treatment with xanthohumol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, xanthohumol (3-70 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen (1 μg/mL) in human platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An electron spin resonance (ESR) method was used to examine the scavenging activity of xanthohumol on free radicals which had formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Xanthohumol (1.5 and 3 μM) markedly reduced the ESR signal intensity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> (OH•) formation in the H₂O₂/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32145">NaOH</z:chebi>/DMSO system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that in addition to its originally being considered an agent preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, xanthohumol possesses potent neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This activity is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> (i.e., HIF-1α, iNOS expression, and free radical formation), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (i.e., TNF-α, active caspase-3), and platelet activation, resulting in a reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improvement in neurobehavior in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this novel role of xanthohumol may represent high therapeutic potential for treatment or prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury-related disorders </plain></SENT>
