<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is upregulated and is neuroprotective in ischemic brain injury, however the expression and localization of its receptors during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model to examine the distribution of erbB receptors following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like neuregulin-1, we observed a dramatic induction of erbB4 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions of the ipsilateral cortex 24 h following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, erbB4 was upregulated in FJB-positive cells, suggesting that erbB receptors are induced in injured neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in erbB receptors was seen in neurons and a subpopulation of macrophages/microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no erbB co-localization with GFAP-positive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that erbB receptors are upregulated in neurons and macrophages/microglia following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and may be involved in neuroprotection and repair </plain></SENT>
