<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that transcriptional control plays a role in the pathophysiology of the postischemic brain, the genomic responses that occurred in the brain at 3, 6 and, 12 h, and 1, 2 or 4 days after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were examined using a microarray harboring 5000 rat cDNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis indicated that the number of up-regulated genes was gradually increased, along with the concomitant reduction in the number of down-regulated genes, until 12 h to 1 day after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was followed by a delayed surge of down-regulated genes at 2 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blots and immunohistological analysis confirmed the validity of these microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a list of 85 genes that were up-regulated more than 2.3-fold between 12 h and 4 days after MCAO, which included 56 novel genes whose expression has not previously been implicated in ischemic pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The list included genes involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, extracellular matrix (ECM), neuronal development and differentiation processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together these results suggest that the pathophysiology of the postischemic brain proceeds by the transcriptional activation of genes related to the process of delayed neuronal damage and/or recovery and repair </plain></SENT>
