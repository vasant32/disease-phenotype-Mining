<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-calcium exchanger NCX1 represents a key mediator for maintaining [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) in anoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no information is available on NCX1 protein expression and activity in microglial cells under ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By means of Western blotting, patch-clamp electrophysiology, single-cell Fura-2 acetoxymethyl-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> microfluorometry, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy, we investigated the regional and temporal changes of NCX1 protein in microglial cells of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and core regions after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exchanger expression and activity were measured in primary microglia isolated ex vivo from the core region of adult rat brains 7 days after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and in cultured microglia under in vitro <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One day after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, NCX1 protein expression was detected in some microglial cells adjacent to the soma of neurons in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, 3 and 7 days after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, NCX1 signal strongly increased in the round-shaped microglia invading the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cultured microglial cells obtained from the core also displayed increased NCX1 expression as compared with contralateral cells and showed enhanced NCX activity in the reverse mode of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, NCX activity and NCX1 protein expression were significantly enhanced in BV2 microglia exposed to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, whereas NCX2 and NCX3 were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in NCX1-silenced cells, [Ca(2+)](i) increase induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was completely prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion- The upregulation of NCX1 expression and activity observed in microglia after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> suggests a relevant role of NCX1 in modulating microglia functions in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
