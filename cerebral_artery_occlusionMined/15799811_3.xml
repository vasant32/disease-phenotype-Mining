<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The use of transgenic and knockout mice has led to a need for a consistent model of mouse transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a great majority of the published mouse middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion studies, the methods indicated the type of intraluminal suture used without indicating the actual suture diameter after modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We attempted to determine the ideal suture diameter to produce consistent occlusion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of adult male C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Suture tips were coated to a depth 4 mm with glue, and 6-0 sutures of eight different, precisely measured diameters were produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coated 6-0 sutures in different diameters were introduced 10 mm into the internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery of the mice to produce <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 40; five animals for each diameter), and the mice (22-24 g) were transaortically perfused with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The base of the brain was exposed, and photographs of the vessels were obtained before and after transaortic injection of Evans blue dye to determine the consistency of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for each suture diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured 10 minutes before occlusion and 20 minutes after reperfusion, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining was performed to demonstrate the ischemic damage in additional animals with 110-microm (n = 5) and 180-microm (n = 8) diameter sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sutures measuring 170 microm and 180 microm in diameter consistently occluded the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining demonstrated consistent infarction with 180-microm diameter sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 36.3 +/- 4.2 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small changes in the diameter of the occlusion suture tip affect consistency in the mouse <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
