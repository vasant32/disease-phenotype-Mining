<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This flow threshold for increase of [K+]o occurs also in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> producing gradient from ischemic core to adjacent normally perfused brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the spatial and temporal stability of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> and blood flow gradients after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[K+]o and regional CBF were measured, respectively, with K+-sensitive and polarographic hydrogen-sensitive microelectrodes at different cortical locations in the middle cerebral artery distribution region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spatial assessment of [K+]o and regional CBF was conducted at 30, 90, and 180 minutes after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[K+]o in the more lateral cortex (core) increased from near 3 mmol/L before MCAO to greater than 50 mmol/L and was associated with flow values less than 25% of pre-ischemic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements medial to the core (penumbra) indicated progressively decreasing levels of [K+]o and improvement of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for [K+]o in penumbral zones to decrease toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels with time, but there was little dissipation of [K+]o in core regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the spatial CBF profile remained remarkably constant for the entire recording period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, unlike infarction which has been reported to expand with time after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the spatial [K+]o disturbance tends to contract primarily due to decreasing [K+]o with time in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, steady state levels of [K+]o after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may not be a valuable predictor of cell viability </plain></SENT>
