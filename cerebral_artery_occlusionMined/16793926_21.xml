<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of a chemical genetic screen using small molecules with known pharmacologies coupled with a cortical brain slice-based model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a small-molecule compound not previously appreciated to have neuroprotective action in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7522">neriifolin</z:chebi>, and demonstrated that its properties in the brain slice assay included delayed therapeutic potential exceeding 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7522">Neriifolin</z:chebi> is structurally related to the digitalis class of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi>, and its putative target is the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> compounds tested also showed neuroprotective activity, although with lower apparent potencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In subsequent whole-animal studies, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7522">neriifolin</z:chebi> provided significant neuroprotection in a neonatal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase is of particular interest because of its known "druggability"; indeed, Food and Drug Administration-approved, small-molecule compounds such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi> and digoxin have been in clinical usage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> for several decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, an existing cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> or closely related compound could provide an accelerated path toward clinical trial testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings underscore the important role that hypothesis-neutral, high-content, tissue-based screens can play in the identification of new candidate drugs and drug targets for the treatment of diseases for which validated therapeutic pathways are not currently available </plain></SENT>
