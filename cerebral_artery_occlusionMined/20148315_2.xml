<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell-cycle inhibition has shown dramatic reduction in infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">Ceramide</z:chebi> can induce cell-cycle arrest by up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21 and p27 through activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609)-increased <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> levels after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) probably by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> synthase (SMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D609 significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and up-regulated Cdk inhibitor p21 and down-regulated phospho-<z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (pRb) expression after tMCAO in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Others have suggested bFGF-induced astrocyte proliferation is attenuated by D609 due to an increase in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> by SMS inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>D609 also reduced the formation of oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (OxPC) protein adducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>D609 may attenuate generation of reactive oxygen species and formation of OxPC by inhibiting microglia/macrophage proliferation after tMCAO (please also see note added in proof: D609 may prevent mature neurons from entering the cell cycle at the early reperfusion, however may not interfere with later proliferation of microglia/ macrophages that are the source of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in offering protection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that D609 provides benefit after tMCAO by attenuating <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha and Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that D609 provides benefit after stoke through inhibition of SMS, increased <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> levels, and induction of cell-cycle arrest by up-regulating p21 and causing hypophosphorylation of Rb (through increased protein phosphatase activity and/or Cdk inhibition) </plain></SENT>
