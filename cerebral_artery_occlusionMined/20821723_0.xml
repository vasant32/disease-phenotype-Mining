<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thermal polarization yields negligible <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> signal relative to hyperpolarized <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>; therefore, hyperpolarized <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> can be used as a tracer of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a rat permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, we demonstrated that hyperpolarized (129)Xe MRI is able to detect, in vivo, the hypoperfused area of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, that is the ischemic core area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hyperpolarized (129)Xe MRI has been used to explore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study shows a novel application of hyperpolarized (129)Xe MRI for imaging <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and further demonstrates its capacity to serve as a complementary tool to proton MRI for the study of the pathophysiology during brain hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
