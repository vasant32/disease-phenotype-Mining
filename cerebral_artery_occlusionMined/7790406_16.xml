<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCMRglc) and local CBF (LCBF) is known to be disturbed in regions surrounding an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal ischemic lesion--areas that undergo repeated transient depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the relationship between LCMRglc and LCBF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal ischemic penumbra to quantify metabolism-flow uncoupling, and we related these findings to local electrophysiological measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel strategy utilizing three-dimensional (3D) autoradiographic image averaging yielded group 3D reconstructions of LCBF, LCMRglc, and the CMR/CBF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distal right middle cerebral artery of Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded by laser-driven photothrombosis following administration of the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>; this was coupled with permanent ipsilateral and 1-h contralateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LCBF (n = 7) and LCMRglc (n = 7) were measured autoradiographically at 1.25 and 1.5-2 h postocclusion, respectively, in matched animal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the ischemic penumbra (defined as having LCBF of 20-40% of control or 0.23-0.47 ml g-1 min-1), LCMRglc showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern with values ranging from near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting CMRglc/CBF ratio in this zone was 234 +/- 100 mumol/100 ml (mean +/- SD), representing a severe degree of metabolism-flow dissociation when compared with the CMRglc/CBF ratio of 51.0 +/- 28.7 mumol/100 ml of the contralateral (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolism-flow uncoupling was confined to the ipsilateral cortex and was most prominent at the anterior and posterior coronal poles of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the frontoparietal penumbra, where marked uncoupling was observed, sustained deflections of the DC potential were recorded, which increased significantly in duration over the initial 65 min postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of LCMRglc and the widespread distribution of increased CMRglc/CBF ratio in the ischemic penumbra are thought to reflect the metabolic consequences of periinfarct depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of averaged 3D autoradiographic data sets provides a powerful means for assessing metabolism-flow uncoupling surrounding an ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
