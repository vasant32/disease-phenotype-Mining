<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using homozygous human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E2 (apoE2) (2/2)-, apoE3 (3/3)-, or apoE4 (4/4)-knock-in (KI) mice, we aimed to examine whether an apoE isoform-specific exacerbation of delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion occurs after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice, 4/4-KI mice exhibited significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and worse neurologic deficits after pMCAO, with no significant differences between the latter two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in 4/4-KI mice was significantly increased from 1 to 5 days after pMCAO, whereas that in 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice was not significantly altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphatenick end-labeling was increased to a similar degree in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the KI mice by 5 days after pMCAO, with no significant differences among the mouse groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At every time-point examined, human apoE was most markedly expressed in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, with similar immunoreactivity among the three lines of KI mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive burden in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was progressively increased through 7 days in 4/4-KI mice, but not in 2/2- or 3/3-KI mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that the apoE4 isoform acts to aggravate delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of pMCAO in genetically engineered apoE-KI mice </plain></SENT>
