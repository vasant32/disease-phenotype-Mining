<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(23) Na-magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown considerable potential for measuring subtle changes in ischemic tissue, although studies to date have suffered primarily from poor signal/noise ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, accurate quantification of tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> concentration (TSC) was achieved in (23) Na images with voxel sizes of 1.2 μL acquired in 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolution of TSC was investigated from 0.5 to 8 h in focal cortical and subcortical ischemic tissue following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes determined from TSC measurements correlated significantly with histology (P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A delayed linear model was fitted to the TSC time course data in each voxel, which revealed that the TSC increase was more immediate (0.2 ± 0.1 h delay time) in subcortical ischemic tissue, whereas it was delayed by 1.6 ± 0.5 h in ischemic cortex (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences (P = 0.5) were measured between TSC slope rates in cortical (10.2 ± 1.1 mM/h) and subcortical (9.7 ± 1.1 mM/h) ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that any TSC increase measured in ischemic tissue indicates infarction (core) and regions exhibiting a delay to TSC increase indicate potentially salvageable tissue (penumbra) </plain></SENT>
