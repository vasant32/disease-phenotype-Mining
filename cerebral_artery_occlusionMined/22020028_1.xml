<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (NBO) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to restore penumbral oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inspired by recent reports on postconditioning with intermittent occlusions of cerebral artery, we tested the hypothesis that intermittent NBO (iNBO) may cause oscillation of cerebral oxygenation and thereby elicit repetitive interruptions to reperfusion, leading to attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion damage after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, animals received air, iNBO (4 cycles of 3 minutes of NBO and 2 minutes of air), continuous NBO (cNBO; 75 minutes), short NBO (18 minutes), or a combination of iNBO and cNBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological score were evaluated at 24 and 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> was assessed by the hydroethidine method, and the expression of Akt and phosphorylated Akt was examined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: iNBO and cNBO had similar effects in reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit at 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas at 72 hours the neuroprotection exerted by iNBO was greater than cNBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining iNBO and cNBO produced no greater protection, and short NBO failed to provide neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both iNBO and cNBO attenuated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, prolonged activation of Akt was observed in the iNBO group, and neuroprotection by iNBO was partly eliminated by inhibition of Akt activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: iNBO may represent a novel form of postconditioning, and this neuroprotection is likely mediated by attenuating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation and activation of the Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
