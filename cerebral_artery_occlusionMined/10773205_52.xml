<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established a focal preconditioning (PC) paradigm that produces significant and prolonged ischemic tolerance (IT) of the brain to subsequent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PC using 10 min of MCAO induces brain tolerance at 1-7 days of reperfusion that requires active protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protective protein(s) involved are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these studies the increased transcription and translation of the inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) and the 27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were determined by Northern analysis and immunohistochemistry following PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization of proteins was determined by double labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PC produced no brain injury but did increase Hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transiently at 6 h and increased Hsp27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> later at 24 h for at least 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein expression induced by PC exhibited a similar profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hsp70 protein was primarily expressed in neurons from 1 to 5 days post-PC throughout the PC cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hsp27 protein expression was initiated later for a much longer period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A remarkable astroglyosis was verified with increased astrocytic Hsp27 from 1 to 7 days after PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>Gliosis</z:hpo> with increased Hsp27 in the PC cortex was still present but reduced 4 weeks after PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PC that results in brain tolerance/neuroprotection increases neuronal Hsp70 in the PC cortex and activated astrocytic Hsp27 in the PC cortex in a temporal fashion associated with developing IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The short duration of benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (PC) that produces IT produces a robust, long-lived cellular and protein synthetic response that extends throughout the entire cortex (i.e. well beyond the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> perfusion territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The resulting IT is associated with changes in astrocyte-activation that might provide increased support and protection from injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although both Hsp70 and Hsp27 may participate in the neuroprotection/brain tolerance induced by PC, the temporal expression patterns of these proteins indicate that they are not solely responsible for the tolerance to brain injury </plain></SENT>
