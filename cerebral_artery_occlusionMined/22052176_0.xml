<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of a focal ischaemic brain injury, apart from the determination of the size of the lesion, another valuable tool is the evaluation of the final functional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, ischaemic damage leads to the appearance of different degrees of sensoriomotor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, which may yield useful information on location and size of the lesion and on the efficacy of neuroprotective treatments after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the magnitude of these impairments may also be useful to predict final outcome and to evaluate neuro-restorative therapies in a long-term scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this aim, a wide range of tests has been developed which allow the quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review intends to compile the most useful behavioural tests designed to assess neurological symptoms in studies of focal experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rodents induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the most commonly used model of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
