<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the ratio of GLUT1 transcription rate to actin transcription rate is comparable in brain and the five other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Organ extracts were fractionated into cytosol and polysomes, and ultraviolet light cross-linking studies were performed with these proteins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labeled GLUT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> containing the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) generated from transcription plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytosol of brain, lung, spleen, C6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells in tissue culture, and freshly isolated bovine brain capillaries express a pair of 95 kDa and 74 kDa proteins, designated collectively as p88, and the polysome fraction of brain, testis, or C6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells express a 44-kDa protein, designated p44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, brain cytosol p88 was up-regulated and p44 was down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that GLUT1 gene expression is subject to regulation at the post-transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
