<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is limited by a concomitant activation of the coagulatory system, leading to incomplete or delayed reperfusion, microcirculatory disturbances, or even repeated vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our pilot study sought to assess the therapeutic potential of a new treatment strategy combining rtPA at reduced dosages with a platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitory agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] flow grade 0 to 1) underwent combined intravenous thrombolytic treatment using rtPA at reduced dosages and the GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> MRI (diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were performed at baseline and between days 1 and 2 after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical scores (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and modified Rankin Scale) were assessed at baseline and after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery recanalization (TIMI flow grade 2 and 3) occurred in 13 of 19 patients (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion on follow-up MRI was significantly smaller in patients with recanalization compared with those without recanalization (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only patients with recanalization improved neurologically (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because no symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was observed, the power of our study to detect a symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate of &gt; or =8% was at least 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined thrombolysis with a GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and rtPA at reduced dosages is promising but cannot be recommended for general use before prospective randomized clinical trials are completed </plain></SENT>
