<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and of vascular leakage were compared using these two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The general pattern of damage was similar, with central infarcted areas surrounded by larger vascular leakage areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two models differed in the extent of their vascular leakage areas and in their response to the cerebroprotective agent flunarizine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the two models are not equivalent, probably because they do not damage the vascular endothelium to the same degree </plain></SENT>
