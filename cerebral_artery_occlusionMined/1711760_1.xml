<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and histochemical injury was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the ischemic core, that it improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
