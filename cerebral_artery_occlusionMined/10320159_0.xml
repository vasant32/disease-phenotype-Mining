<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duration of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is thought to vary depending on the conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no study has evaluated factors affecting the duration of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of blood pressure and hemodilution on the duration of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused by the injection of 0.6 mL of air into the common carotid artery was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and compared among the following three periods: a control period, during which the mean blood pressure (MBP) was maintained at 80 mm Hg; a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> period, during which MBP was decreased to 60 mm Hg by exsanguination; and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> plus hemodilution period, during which an additional exchange of blood with hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> solution was performed and MBP was maintained at 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When MBP was lowered from 80 to 60 mm Hg, the duration of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was prolonged from 34+/-39 to 166+/-90 s (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In dogs with MBP of 60 mm Hg, hemodilution (12.0+/-0.9 to 7.3+/-0.5 g/dL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration) shortened the duration from 166+/-90 to 75+/-50 s (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> prolongs and hemodilution shortens the duration of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
