<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the inducible matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is well accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is the only approved thrombolytic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but r-tPA is potentially neurotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after r-tPA treatment has been linked with an increase in cerebral MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> clearly increases the levels of endogenous tPA, the consequence of additional r-tPA may be questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and MMP-9 knockout mice were subjected to 90 min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and treated with 10 mg/kg r-tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after occlusion, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, hemispheric enlargement, collagen and laminin degradation as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were increased in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and MMP-9 knockout treated animals as compared with non-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> but reduced in knockout treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MMP-9 concentration was not modified by r-tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, pre-treatment with p-aminobenzoyl-gly-pro<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30005">-D-leu</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="2" ids="29949">-D-ala</z:chebi>-hydroxamate, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, counteracted the effects of r-tPA on the neurovascular unit and decreased mortality in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP inhibition did not modify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in r-tPA-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that r-tPA toxicity is mainly independent of MMP-9 after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but could involve some other MMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our results support the hypothesis of a dissociation between r-tPA-dependent mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Due to the importance of r-tPA in thrombolytic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, the MMPs that could participate in r-tPA-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption should be further characterized </plain></SENT>
