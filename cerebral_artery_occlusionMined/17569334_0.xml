<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of Kang Naoxueshuan Tablet (KNT) on ischemic brain injury in rats, and explore its possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were administrated with KNT twice per day for successive 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with a nylon suture inserted through the right internal carotid artery to occlude the beginning of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 hrs MCAO, the neurological deficit and the volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were observed, and the effect of KNT on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of rats in vitro, platelet aggregation and blood viscosity were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KNT could alleviate volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> caused by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner and improve neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>18 +/- 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>35% , 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>60 +/- 7.00% and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>37 +/- 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>21% in the high, middle and low-dose groups, respectively, and they were decreased 59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>36% , 46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>93% and 44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>13% than that in the model group 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>51 +/- 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>71% (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>01 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The wet and dry weigh of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vitro of the three different dose groups were significantly decreased, and they were significantly different than that of the model group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>05, P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>KNT could significantly inhibit platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and decrease blood viscosity, but it had no effect on plasma viscosity and hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KNT has significant protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the mechanism is relateed to the improvement of blood viscosity and inhibiti on of platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>But the exact mechanisms need to be probed into deeply </plain></SENT>
