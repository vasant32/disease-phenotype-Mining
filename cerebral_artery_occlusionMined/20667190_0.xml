<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and limitation of local intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy using urokinase (UK) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were treated with local intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy within six hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 17 (range, 6 to 28).Two hundred and forty thousand IU of UK was administered through a microcatheter for 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When arterial recanalization was not achieved, a second or third infusion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum dosage of UK was 0.96 x 106 IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization efficacy was evaluated at the end of fibrinolytic therapy and intracranial haemorrhage was assessed within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was evaluated three months after ictus with modified Rankin scale (RS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (78%) obtained recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of 39 (74%) showed clinical improvement just after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only 18% patients (2/11) who did not recanalize demonstrated improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of 50 (50%) patients recovered to RS score 0 or 1, however, only 28% of patients (5/18) with proximal M1 occlusion obtained good outcome and 39% of them (7/18) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment did not affect outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of haemorrhagic event (HE) within 24 hours was 36%, however, 78% of patients with proximal M1 occlusion showed HE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with HE clinically deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, local intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy could be a safe and effective method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, however, indication of this therapy for patients with proximal M1 occlusion should be carefully decided </plain></SENT>
