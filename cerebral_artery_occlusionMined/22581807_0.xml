<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although various reports have shown that β-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> provide neuroprotective effects after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, their effect on spatial memory after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the treatment of β1-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> on neurological outcome spatial memory for 1 month after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male rats randomly received an i.v. infusion of saline 0.5 ml h(-1), esmolol 200 μg kg(-1) min(-1), or landiolol 50 ��g kg(-1) min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion was initiated 30 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and continued for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in the hippocampus and striatum were measured after the final retention trial and neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological deficit scores in the landiolol- and esmolol-treated rats were significantly lower than in the control rats at 1, 4, 7, and 11 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> to assess spatial memory, we found that escape latency and swimming path length to the platform were significantly shorter in the landiolol-treated rats, compared with the saline-treated rats at 4 and 11 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was 19.1 (8.0)% in the striatum and 18.6 (10.0)% in the hippocampus of the landiolol-treated rats, and 16.8 (14.0)% and 16.8 (15.0)% in the striatum and hippocampus, respectively, of esmolol-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was significantly less than in control rats [striatum 31.7 (14.0)% and hippocampus 29.8 (13.0)%, P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that although esmolol and landiolol provided long-term neuroprotection in terms of histological outcome, they had no effect on neurological outcome and spatial memory retention </plain></SENT>
