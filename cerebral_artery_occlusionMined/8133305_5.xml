<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously we reported an improvement in histological outcome in cats treated with MK-801 shortly after the induction of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and examined after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 4 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the prolonged effects of the same drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in 34 cats by temporary occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was determined using the ratio of the EEG amplitude from the ipsilateral to that of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, cats were treated i.v. with either 1 mg/kg MK-801 or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocortical activity of the animals who survived were followed for 6 days postocclusion at which point they were sacrificed for histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the animals died during recovery, of which 4 were MK-801 treated, and 8 were saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEG ratios in the non-surviving animals were more depressed than in the animals that survived, whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the EEG amplitude in both the treated and the control surviving animals was equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the survivors no reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size with MK-801 treatment was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus treatment with MK-801 in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in the cat leads to a significant increase in the rate of survival (P &lt; 0.05), but no prolonged improvement in late histopathology, in contrast with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> histological findings using this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MK-801 treatment may be shifting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model towards the survival of animals with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histological recovery during prolonged reperfusion may eliminate the early neuroprotective effects seen with MK-801 treatment </plain></SENT>
