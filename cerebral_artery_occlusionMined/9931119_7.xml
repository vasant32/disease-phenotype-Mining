<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed structural and functional analyses of these 2 genes in SHRSP from Glasgow colonies (SHRSPGla) and Wistar-Kyoto rats from Glasgow colonies (WKYGla) and developed a radiation hybrid map of the relevant region of rat chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the coding regions of the Anp and Bnp genes revealed no difference between the 2 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression studies in brain tissue showed no differences at baseline and at 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) did not differ between the SHRSPGla and WKYGla, whereas concentrations of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were significantly higher in the SHRSPGla as compared with the WKYGla (n=11 to 14; 163+/-21 pg/mL and 78+/-14 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval 31 to 138, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin or ANP in middle cerebral arteries from the SHRSPGla; indeed the sensitivity to ANP was significantly increased in arteries harvested from this strain (WKYGla: n=8; pD2=7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3+/-0.2 and SHRSPGla: n=8; pD2=8.2+/-0.15; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization allowed us to map the Anf marker in the telomeric position of rat chromosome 5 in close proximity to D5Rat48, D5Rat47, D5Mgh15, and D5Mgh16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results exclude Anp and Bnp as candidate genes for the sensitivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and pave the way to further congenic and physical mapping strategies </plain></SENT>
