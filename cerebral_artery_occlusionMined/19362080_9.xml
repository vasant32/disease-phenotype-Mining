<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin (APN), a circulating adipose-derived hormone regulating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and energy metabolism, has beneficial actions on cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypoadiponectinemia is associated with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, however, little is known about the cerebroprotective action of APN as well as its molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the role of APN in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral injury was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into three groups: (i) a sham operation group; (ii) an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) group, rats were subjected to 1 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 23 h reperfusion (I/R); (iii) a APN-treated group, two bolus of 5 microg APN was administered through jugular vein before and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I/R resulted in obvious cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, neurological deficits, and increased expression of endogenous immunoglobin G and matrix metalloproteinase 9, which can be significantly diminished by administration of APN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that APN can significantly inhibited cerebral expression of myeloperoxidase, a distinct indicator of inflammatory cell infiltration, and inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1beta, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and IL-8 in response to I/R, suggesting that APN exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (p65), a critical transcription factor involved in inflammatory reactions, was observed predominantly located in the nucleus after I/R, whereas APN can obviously inhibit its translocation from cytoplasm into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of this study demonstrate that APN exerts a potent cerebroprotective function through its anti-inflammatory action, and NF-kappaB (p65) is a key component in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APN might be potential molecular targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
