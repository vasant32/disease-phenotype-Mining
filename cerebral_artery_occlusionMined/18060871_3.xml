<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin B activity increased predominantly in the subcortical region of the ischemic hemisphere where the levels of collapsing mediator response protein 2, heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein, 60 kDa heat shock protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi> isomerase A3 and albumin, were found to be significantly elevated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggests that the decrease in heat shock protein levels and the significant reduction of serum albumin leakage into the brain following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with CP-1 is indicative of less secondary ischemic damage, which ultimately, is related to less cerebral tissue loss and improved neurological recovery of the animals </plain></SENT>
