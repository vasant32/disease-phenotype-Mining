<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we propose that the cytoprotective effects attributed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> and tunicamycin in an in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are reflected by changes in neuronal tissue levels of m-calpain, HSP70, GRP94 and GRP78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>, tunicamycin or both demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area following 4 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that 4 h of MCAO was associated with decreased cortical expression of HSP70 and m-calpain and increased expression of GRP78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 12.5 microg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> did not change this pattern of protein expression following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While GRP94 expression was elevated in sham-operated rats pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>, the ensuing ischemic tolerance did not appear to be mediated by changes in cellular stress proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 50 microg/kg tunicamycin significantly reduced HSP70 in cortical tissue samples taken from sham-operated rats and appeared to attenuate the threshold for activation of m-calpain in rats undergoing 4 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, a combined treatment in which rats undergoing MCAO were pretreated with both tunicamycin (24 h prior) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (30 min prior) was associated with an attenuated stress response as indicated by reduced expression of GRP78 and GRP94 when compared to saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the ischemic tolerance observed following MCAO in rats pretreated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> or tunicamycin is likely mediated in part through differential effects on cellular stress proteins </plain></SENT>
