<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many researchers have sought to study changes in gene expression in preclinical models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These range from in vitro models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and regeneration to in vivo animal models aimed at replicating pathologies and regenerative processes typical of the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such models, changes in gene expression occur, which may be assessed by measuring the abundance of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcribed from particular genes of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The advent of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has vastly improved the sensitivity and accuracy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detection and is now the method of choice in many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this is a relatively simple and rapid technique, it has a number of pitfalls, especially in experimental design and data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this chapter we describe a detailed experimental protocol for real-time RT-PCR detection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts, as used in the rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss methods for analysis and interpretation of the resulting data </plain></SENT>
