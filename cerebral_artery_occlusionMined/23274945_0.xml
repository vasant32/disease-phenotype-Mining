<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A multistage workflow was developed for segmenting and counting murine microglias from histopathological brightfield images, in a permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Automated counts are useful, since for the assessment of inflammatory mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> there is a need to quantify the brain's responses to post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which primarily is the rapid activation of microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in murine brain tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry for the ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1) as the microglia marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microglia cells were segmented in seven sequential steps: (i) contrast boosting using quaternion operations, (ii) intensity outlier normalization, (iii) nonlocal total variation denoising, (iv) histogram specification and contrast stretching, (v) homomorphic filtering, (vi) global thresholding, and (vii) morphological filtering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Workflow counts were validated on an image subset, with ground-truth data acquired from manual counts conducted by a neuropathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated workflow matched ground-truth counts pretty well; 80-90% accuracy was achieved, as regards to time after pMCAO and correspondence to ischemic/non-ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
