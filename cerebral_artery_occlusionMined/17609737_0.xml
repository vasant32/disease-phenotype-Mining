<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were pretreated with TAK-044 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and aspirin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days individually and in combination in different groups, and were thereafter subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 2 h by occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the rats were subjected to motor performance tests and killed subsequently for estimation of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group received the vehicle and the same protocol was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats, significant (p &lt; 0.01) motor impairment, with elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (600.8 +/- 14.4 nmol/g tissue) and decreased levels of GSH (61.1 +/- 3.1 microg/g tissue) and SOD (8.5 +/- 0.5 U/mg protein,) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with TAK-044 and aspirin for 7 days significantly improved motor function and attenuated the raised levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (475 +/- 14 and 538 +/- 17.3 nmol/g tissue, respectively) and the decrease in GSH (101 +/- 5 and 100 +/- 4.5 microg/g tissue, respectively) and SOD (12.1 +/- 0.5 and 10.5 +/- 0.6 U/mg protein, respectively), as compared to vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination of both the agents did not show a significant difference as compared to the individual drugs alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that, although protection was observed with both the drugs (TAK-044 and aspirin), there was no enhanced effect when both agents were given in combination </plain></SENT>
