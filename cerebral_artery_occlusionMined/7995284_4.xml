<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A protocol has been devised to effectively extend the limited post-reconstitution shelf life of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m exametazime as a radiopharmaceutical for imaging cerebral blood flow (CBF) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential of 99mTc-exametazime stabilised with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> for imaging CBF distribution as late as 4 h after reconstitution has been examined in ischaemic and non-ischaemic tissue in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anaesthetised cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was produced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between 99mTc-exametazime uptake and retention and CBF (assessed with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine 10 min after first radiopharmaceutical administration) was determined in the same tissue section with double label autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the CBF range 0-80 ml 100 g-1 min-1, the uptake of 99mTc-exametazime (quantitatively and topographically) was linearly related to CBF irrespective of whether the 99mTc-labelled tracer was unstabilised (and administered within 10 min of reconstitution) or was stabilised with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (and administered up to 240 min after reconstitution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For levels of CBF in excess of 80 ml 100 g-1 min-1 the excellent topographical relationship between 99mTc-exametazime distribution and CBF is maintained but quantitatively, 99mTc-exametazime underestimates CBF to a similar degree in animals receiving stabilised and unstabilised 99mTc-exametazime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of the stabiliser, <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, extends greatly the period over which 99mTc-exametazime can be used after reconstitution to generate images of CBF distribution in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischaemic cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
