<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Erythropoietin (EPO) confers potent neuroprotection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requires high doses and multiple administrations of EPO, which may cause deleterious side effects due to its erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study identifies a novel nonerythropoietic mutant EPO and investigates its potential neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed a series of mutant EPOs, each containing a single amino acid mutation within the erythropoietic motif, and tested their erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using cortical neuronal cultures exposed to N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> neurotoxicity and a murine model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, neuroprotection and neurofunctional outcomes were assessed as well as activation of intracellular signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serine to isoleucine mutation at position 104 (S104I-EPO) completely abolished the erythropoietic and platelet-stimulating activity of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of S104I-EPO significantly inhibited N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in primary cultures and protected against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological deficits with an efficacy similar to that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both S104-I-EPO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EPO activated similar prosurvival signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and STAT5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effects of S104-I-EPO, indicating that activation of these pathways underlies the neuroprotective mechanism of mutant EPO against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S104-I-EPO confers neuroprotective effects comparable to those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EPO against ischemic brain injury with the added benefit of lacking erythropoietic and platelet-stimulating side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our novel findings suggest that the nonerythropoietic mutant EPO is a legitimate candidate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> intervention </plain></SENT>
