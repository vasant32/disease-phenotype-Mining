<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expressed on endothelial cells that facilitates leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of administration of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody (1A29) on ischemic cell damage after transient (2-hour) or permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the Wistar rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Groups studied were as follows: (1) transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion: rats were subjected to 2 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and after 1 hour of reperfusion they were treated with 1A29 (n = 11) or an isotype control antibody (n = 9); and (2) permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion: rats were treated with 1A29 (n = 9) or an isotype control antibody (n = 7) 2 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions (P &lt; .05) in both volume (44%) of the ischemic lesion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were found in animals subjected to transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and treated with 1A29 compared with vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in animals subjected to permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion the lesion and the temporal profile of body weight were not altered by 1A29 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic cell damage is promoted by postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after 2 hours of transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and ischemic cell damage is reduced by administration of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
