<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> induced a dramatic increase in the ECF levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major part of these changes occurred during the first 10 min after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">Inosine</z:chebi> tended to normalize towards the end, while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> remained elevated throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no increase of the energy-related metabolites in CSF during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> appear to be useful ECF markers of the compromised energy state of the brain during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the metabolites did not appear in CSF during the first 6 h after MCAO, such measurements seem not to be useful for early detection of a disturbance in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
