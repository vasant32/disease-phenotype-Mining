<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether haemorrhagic complications can be predicted by evaluating CT findings before and after intra-arterial reperfusion therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretherapeutic early CT signs within three hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and post-therapeutic contrast extravasation were evaluated in 61 patients treated within six hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early CT signs were evaluated in the deep (obscuration of the margin of the lentiform nucleus and loss of the insular ribbon) and superficial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories (cortical effacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic transformations were seen in 39.3% of patients, 54.2% of them had both pre-therapeutic early CT signs and post-therapeutic contrast extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Obscuration of the entire lentiform nucleus and the presence of contrast extravasation were reliable predictors for haemorrhagic transformations, and cortical effacement had also a tendency to be associated with haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of early CT signs did not always result in the absence of haemorrhagic transformations and 37.5% of haemorrhage occurred in the presumed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> area without early CT signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, absence of post-therapeutic contrast extravasation was a reliable negative predictor for intraparenchymal haematoma </plain></SENT>
