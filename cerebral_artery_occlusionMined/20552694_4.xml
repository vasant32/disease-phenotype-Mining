<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> often aggravate the neurological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> released after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are closely related to the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we directly profiled the changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the infarcted rat cerebral cortex 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) species and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> (SM) were significantly decreased after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cationization pattern of the remaining PCs showed a prominent shift from a mostly potassiated or protonated form to a predominantly sodiated pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> also elevated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11230">lysophosphatidylcholines</z:chebi> (LPCs) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The isobaric pairs in PC and LPC classes were resolved by masses through their respective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22314">alkali metal</z:chebi> adducts in the presence of CsCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major fatty acyl LPC species were also structurally confirmed by MALDI-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results described the changes in PC and LPC species in the infarcted rat cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The elevated tissue levels of LPCs and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> signify the ongoing pathological <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> breakdown and the state of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The elevated LPC level in tissue suggests a means of intervention through lysophospholipid metabolism that could potentially benefit the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological injuries </plain></SENT>
