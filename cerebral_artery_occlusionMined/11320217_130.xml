<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using mice genetically deficient in FGF-2 (FGF-2(-/-) mice), we addressed the importance of endogenously generated FGF-2 on neurogenesis within the hippocampus, a structure involved in spatial, declarative, and contextual memory, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BrdUrd incorporation was used to mark dividing neuroprogenitor cells and NeuN expression to monitor their differentiation into neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> strain, hippocampal FGF-2 increased after either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> injection or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and the numbers of BrdUrd/NeuN-positive cells significantly increased on days 9 and 16 as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FGF-2(-/-) mice, BrdUrd labeling was attenuated after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, as was the number of neural cells colabeled with both BrdUrd and NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After FGF-2(-/-) mice were injected intraventricularly with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus-1 amplicon vector carrying FGF-2 gene, the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells increased significantly to values equivalent to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates after kainate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that endogenously synthesized FGF-2 is necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells in the adult hippocampus after brain insult </plain></SENT>
