<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Dazhui" (GV 14) on the ultrastructure of cerebral cortex in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion (CI/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen SD rats were equally randomized into sham-operation (sham), model and EA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CI/R model was established by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA (20 Hz/80 Hz, 1-3 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Dazhui" (GV 14) for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic cerebral cortex tissue was taken, fixed in 2.5% glutaral solution, embedded in araldite, cut into sections and stained for observing the ultrastructure changes of cortical pyramidal cells, astrocyte and blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) under transmission electronic microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In sham group, the anatomical structure of the cerebral pyramidal cells was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In model group, the neuronal mitochondria and the capillary endothelium and the processes of the astrocyte got swelling, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> cristae were broken, the capillary lumens became narrow or were blocked up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In EA group, the injury degree of the pyramidal cells, glial cells and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> were lighter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can reduce ischemic injury of the cerebral cortical neurons and blood brain barrier in rats with CI/R injury </plain></SENT>
