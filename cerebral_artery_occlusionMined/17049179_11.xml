<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time course of nuclear translocation of AIF after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may vary with the severity of injury and may be accelerated by oxidant stress associated with reperfusion and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblots of AIF on nuclear fractions of ischemic hemisphere of male mice showed no significant increase with 1 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and no reperfusion, whereas increases were detectable after 6 and 24 h of permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, as little as 20 min of reperfusion after 1 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in an increase in nuclear AIF coincident with an increase in poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymer (PAR) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further nuclear AIF accumulation was seen at 6 and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 20 min of reperfusion after 2 h of occlusion did not increase nuclear AIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case, nuclear AIF became detectable at 6 and 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With brief occlusion of 30 min duration, nuclear AIF remained undetectable at both 20 min and 6 h and became evident only after 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of neuronal NO synthase attenuated formation of PAR and nuclear AIF accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene deletion of neuronal NO synthase also attenuated nuclear AIF accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, reperfusion accelerates AIF translocation to the nucleus when focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is of moderate duration (1 h), but is markedly delayed after brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nuclear translocation of AIF eventually occurs with prolonged focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with or without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neuronally-derived NO is a major factor contributing to nuclear AIF accumulation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
