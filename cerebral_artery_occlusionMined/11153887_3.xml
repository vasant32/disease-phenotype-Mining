<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is defined as crossed cerebellar diaschisis and can be diagnosed clinically by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in terms of regional cerebral blood flow or metabolic rate of oxygen measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> indicators (<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes) were measured in rat cerebral cortices and cerebella after permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in order to assess the crossed cerebellar diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> values in ipsilateral cortex were significantly higher than those in contralateral cortex at 10 (P &lt; 0.001) and 60 (P &lt; 0.05) min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but no significant changes were observed in both cerebellum compared to the 0 min values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cerebral cortex and cerebellum cGMP levels at 10 and 60 min were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase was marked in ipsilateral cortex and contralateral cerebellum when compared with opposite cortex and cerebellum (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> values in ipsilateral cortex were significantly higher than those in contralateral cortex at 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral cerebellar <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> values were found significantly higher than those in ipsilateral cerebellum at 0 (P&lt;0.001) and 60 (P &lt; 0.05) min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ipsilateral cortex, conjugated diene values at 0, 10, 60 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were higher than those in contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand 0, 10, 60 min conjugated diene levels in contralateral cerebellum were significantly higher than those in ipsilateral cerebellum (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the interruption of the corticopontocerebellar tract as the mechanism of the crossed cerebellar diaschisis </plain></SENT>
