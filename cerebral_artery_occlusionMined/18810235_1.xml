<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The annual risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or cardiovascular events has been reported to be over 10% in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognosis of patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the risk of cardiovascular events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with MCAO demonstrated by transcranial Doppler sonography and magnetic resonance angiography were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed during the follow-up period and a telephone interview was conducted using a preformed questionnaire, comparing asymptomatic and symptomatic patients who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in the same vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The composite outcome of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), any vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven of the 48 patients were symptomatic and 11 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the mean follow-up period of 2.8 years, cardiovascular events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in a total of 13 patients: 1 from the asymptomatic group and 12 from the symptomatic group (overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 6; MI, 2; vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 1; nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual rates of composite outcome (2.2 vs. 13.2%, p = 0.041) and overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.0 vs. 6.6%, p = 0.048) were significantly lower in the asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the overall prognosis of MCAO is not worse than previously reported for patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic MCAO seems to be a benign condition associated with a low risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under the optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
