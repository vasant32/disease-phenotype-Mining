<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor activation with deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> would cause deleterious remodeling of the cerebral vasculature and exacerbate the damage caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six-week-old male Wistar rats were treated with deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks of age, the deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated rats had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> compared with age-matched controls (157+/-5.9 versus 124+/-3.1 mm Hg deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> versus control; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of ischemic damage resulting from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was greater in the deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated rats than control (63.5+/-3.72 versus 46.6+/-5.52% of the hemisphere infarcted, deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> versus control; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery structure was assessed using a pressurized arteriograph under calcium-free conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a range of intralumenal pressures, the lumen and ODs of the middle cerebral arteries were smaller in the deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated rats than the control rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also an increase in the wall thickness and wall:lumen ratio in the vessels from deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vessels from the deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated rats were stiffer than those from control rats as evidenced by a leftward shift in the stress/strain curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These novel data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor activation without salt loading and nephrectomy is sufficient to elicit deleterious effects on the cerebral vasculature that lead to inward hypertrophic remodeling and an increase in the ischemic damage in the event of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
