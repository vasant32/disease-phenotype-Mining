<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Findings that MHP36 stem cells grafted into intact parenchyma contralateral to the lesion induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> promoted recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> deficits led us to investigate whether implantation site of stem cells affects the functional efficacy of MHP36 grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MHP36 cells (200 000/8 microL) were implanted in the left (n=8) or right (n=9) parenchyma or infused into the right ventricle (intraventricular; n=7) 2 to 3 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by 60 minutes of intraluminal right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intact (n=11) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=7) control groups were tested for 14 weeks in bilateral asymmetry, rotation bias, and spatial learning tasks before histological investigation of cell distribution and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats with left and right parenchymal grafts showed reduced bilateral asymmetry but no improvement in spatial learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, spatial learning improved in rats with intraventricular grafts, but marked asymmetry persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No grafted group showed reduced <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-induced rotation bias or reduced lesion volume relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grafted groups, cells occupied both sides of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third of cells grafted in the striatum crossed the midline to occupy homologous regions in intact and lesioned hemispheres and differentiated into site-appropriate phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both the intact and lesioned hemispheres attract grafted stem cells, suggesting repair processes that utilize cells both for local repair and to augment plastic changes in contralateral motor pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, differential effects of parenchymal and intraventricular grafts suggest that different mechanisms are implicated in recovery from cognitive and sensorimotor deficits induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
