<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work discussed the effects of substrain or genetic differences, gender, and age of the rat on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size produced by distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SHR/Kyushu, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly larger than that of SHR/Izm, while blood pressure levels were essentially the same between the two substrains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although SHR-SP/Izm had a higher blood pressure than SHR/Kyushu, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were the same between SHR/Kyushu and SHR-SP/Izm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the presence of blood pressure-independent factors which affect the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> accounted the large part of greater tolerability against focal brain ischemic injury in female compared with male SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found age-related vulnerability to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in female SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This age-related vulnerability in aged female SHR was unrelated to the blood levels of sex hormones such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we emphasized the importance of reproducible and least invasive focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
