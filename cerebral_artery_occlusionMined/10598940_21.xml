<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported recently that very delayed damage can occur as a result of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> of short duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With use of diffusion-, T2-, and contrast-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, the occlusion time dependence together with the temporal profile for this delayed response in a rat model of transient focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distal branch of the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 20, 30, 45, or 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with reperfusion exhibited no significant mean change in either the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) or the T2 relaxation time at 6, 24, 48, or 72 hours after reperfusion (P = 0.97 and 0.70, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused dramatic tissue injury at 6 hours, as indicated by an increase in T2 relaxation times to 135% of the contralateral values (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at intermediate periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (30 to 45 minutes), complete reversal of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was seen at 6 hours after reperfusion but was followed by a secondary decline over time, such that a 25% reduction in tissue <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was seen at 24 as compared with 6 hours (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This secondary response was accompanied by an increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV), as shown by contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI (120% of contralateral values; P &lt; 0.001), an increase in T2 relaxation time (132%; P &lt; 0.01), together with clear morphological signs of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By day 18, the mean volume of missing cortical tissue measured with high-resolution MRI in animals occluded for 30 and 45 minutes was 50% smaller than that in 90-minute occluded animals (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that ultimate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size is reduced after early reperfusion and is occlusion time dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The early tissue recovery that is seen with intermediate occlusion times can be followed by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which has a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and is accompanied by an increase in CBV </plain></SENT>
