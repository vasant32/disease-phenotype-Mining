<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noggin, an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), has been demonstrated to provide protection from ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we hypothesize that administering Noggin-transfected BMSCs enhances BMSC-induced brain repair after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of BMSCs alone and Noggin-transfected BMSCs (Noggin-BMSCs) systematically delivered into the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noggin expression in BMSCs was achieved using adenoviral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> together with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector to monitor transduction efficiency and facilitate posttransplantation tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMSCs and Noggin-BMSCs were intravenously injected into the rats 6 hr after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 7 days after MCAo, the GFP-expressing BMSCs and Noggin-BMSCs were found primarily in the ischemic penumbra, which indicated that the intravenously delivered cells survived and reached in the lesion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both BMSC and Noggin-BMSC treatment significantly promoted neurogenesis in the ipsilateral subventrical zone (SVZ), reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and led to functional improvement compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these beneficial effects were significantly greater in the Noggin-BMSC-treated group compared with BMSCs alone treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Noggin expression in the ischemic hemisphere was significantly increased in the Noggin-BMSC-treated group as revealed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 7 days after MCAo compared with BMSC-treated and control groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that transfection of Noggin in BMSCs enhances BMSC-induced neuroprotective effects when administered intravenously during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
