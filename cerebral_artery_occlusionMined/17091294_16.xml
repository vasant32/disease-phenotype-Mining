<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation of ET receptors occurs via de novo transcription involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of inhibition of the MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 on ET receptor alteration, brain damage, and neurology in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in male Wistar rats by the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals received 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or vehicle in conjunction with the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, the rats were decapitated and the brains removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral arteries were dissected out and examined with myographs or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic areas of the brains were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the MCAO, the contractile responses of the <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptors were augmented in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>U0126 decreased this alteration in ET receptor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with U0126 significantly decreased the brain damage and improved neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that there were lower protein levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and phosphorylated transcription factor Elk-1 in the U0126-treated rats compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show that treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decreases brain damage, neurological symptoms, and ET receptor alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The vascular effects of U0126 provide new perspective on possible mechanisms of actions of MAPK inhibition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
