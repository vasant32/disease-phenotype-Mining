<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It remains unknown whether the effects of 0.6 mg/kg alteplase differ with occlusion site of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the effects of 0.6 mg/kg intravenous alteplase in patients with different sites of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An exploratory analysis was made of 57 patients enrolled in the Japan Alteplase Clinical Trial II (J-ACT II), originally designed to evaluate 0.6 mg/kg alteplase in Japanese patients with unilateral occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M1 or M2 portion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The residual vessel length (in mm), determined by pretreatment magnetic resonance angiography, was used to reflect the occluded site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients with valid recanalization (modified Mori grade 2 to 3) at 6 and 24 hours and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1 and of 0 to 2 at 3 months were compared between the groups dichotomized according to length of the residual vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic-regression models were generated to elucidate the predictors of valid recanalization, mRS 0 to 1, and mRS 0 to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed that 5 mm was the practical cutoff length for dichotomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with an M1 length &lt; 5 mm (n = 12), the frequencies of valid recanalization at 6 and 24 hours (16.7% and 25.0%) were significantly lower compared with those (62.1% and 82.8%, respectively) of the 45 patients with a residual M1 length â‰¥ 5 mm and an M2 occlusion (P = 0.008 for 6 hours, P &lt; 0.001 for 24 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients who achieved an mRS of 0 to 1 and an mRS of 0 to 2 were also lower for those with an M1 length &lt; 5 mm (8.3% and 16.7%, respectively) compared with the other group (57.8% and 68.9%, respectively; P = 0.003 for mRS 0 to 1, P = 0.002 for mRS 0 to 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In logistic-regression models, the site of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (&lt; 5 mm) was a significant predictor of valid recanalization at 6 and 24 hours and of an mRS of 0 to 1 and of mRS of 0 to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, a residual vessel length &lt; 5 mm on magnetic resonance angiography can identify poor responders to 0.6 mg/kg alteplase </plain></SENT>
