<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization is severely reduced early after reperfusion in spite that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and oxygen are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism might be an early predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between early <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism with later development of infarction remains to be further studied in the same subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> consumption was assessed in vivo by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion was evaluated by PET with (13)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16134">NH(3)</z:chebi> during and after 2-hour (h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and (18)F-FDG was given after 2h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was evaluated at 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption was examined ex vivo using a biochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical (18)F-FDG uptake was reduced by 45% and 25% in the ischemic core and periphery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, substantial alteration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration was not apparent until 24h, suggesting that mitochondria retained the ability to consume oxygen early after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> use at early reperfusion in regions that will later develop infarction and, to a lesser extent, in adjacent regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the ischemic core might be attributable to reduced metabolic requirement due to irreversible cellular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in peripheral regions suggests either an impairment of glycolysis or reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study supports that glycolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> early after reperfusion is not always related to subsequent development of infarction </plain></SENT>
