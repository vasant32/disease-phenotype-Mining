<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported that the therapeutic window of FK506 in this model is more than 1 h, but less than 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to determine whether mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (35 degrees C) enhances the neuroprotective effects of FK506 and expands its therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly divided into four groups: (I) vehicle-treated normothermic group; (II) FK506-treated normothermic group; (III) vehicle-treated hypothermic group; (IV) FK506-treated hypothermic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals received a single injection of FK506 (0.3 mg/kg) or vehicle intravenously at 2 h after ischemic induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, temporal muscle and rectal temperatures were maintained at 37 degrees C in the normothermic animals and at 35 degrees C in the hypothermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological performance were evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of FK506 and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (cortex, -61%; striatum, -31%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume (cortex, -57%; striatum, -41%), while mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> or FK506 alone failed to improve ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this combination also provided for the best functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the combination of FK506 and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> significantly reduces ischemic brain damage following transient MCAO in rats, and expands the therapeutic window for FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This therapy may be a new approach for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
