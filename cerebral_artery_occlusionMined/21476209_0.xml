<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of injectable caltrop fruit saponin preparation (ICFSP) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were injected with ICFSP and then subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the neurological deficit score was evaluated by Bederson's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was assessed by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), and the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) in rat cerebrum were measured with kits, and the content of 6 K <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1</z:chebi>α (6-K-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi> 1α), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) and endothelin (ET) in blood plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that ICFSP led to a decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (p &lt; 0.01), neurological deficit score (p &lt; 0.05) and plasma content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> and ET (p &lt; 0.05), and an increase of the plasma level of 6-K-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi> 1α (p &lt; 0.05) and SOD activity in cerebrum, where the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO content were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment improved forelimb function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICFSP showed a similar potency compared to that of Ligustrazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> parenteral solution (LHPS) and nimodipine (Nim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that ICFSP protects the brain damage caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in rats, and this may be closely related to the regulation of reactive oxygen species (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and SOD activity) and NO levels in the rat cerebrum, as well as vasoactive factors in the plasma (6-K-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi> 1α, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> and ET) </plain></SENT>
