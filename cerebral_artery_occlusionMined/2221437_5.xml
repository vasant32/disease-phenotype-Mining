<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of rats were given intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> such that a stable EEG pattern of burst suppression was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one group of rats (n = 11), the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/30% O2, and in the other group (n = 10), ventilation was done with 70% nitrogen/30% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 2 h, during which time mean arterial pressure, blood gases, hematocrit, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and head temperature were held constant between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> administered were similar in both groups as were the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> concentrations immediately prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic evaluations were performed prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 24 and 96 h postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 96 h postischemia using triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and computer imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no neurologic differences between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51144">nitrogen groups</z:chebi> at any experimental interval although both groups exhibited deficits at both 24 and 96 h postischemia relative to preischemic values </plain></SENT>
