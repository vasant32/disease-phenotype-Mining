<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the spatial and temporal expression of Src and Src-suppressed C kinase substrate (SSeCKS) in brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and elucidate the relationships among Src, SSeCKS, and the key angiogenic factors present after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to either MCAO or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting results revealed that Src gradually increased starting as early as 2 h after MCAO and remained high for 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SSeCKS decreased after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Src expression correlated positively with that of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-2, and negatively with that of SSeCKS, angiopoietin-1, and zonula occludens-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, SSeCKS had the reverse correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in the expression of these factors correlated with the progress of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dynamic temporal changes in Src and SSeCKS expression may modulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
