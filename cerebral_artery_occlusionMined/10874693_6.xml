<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) have been used for thrombolitic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it is suggested that these compounds might be involved in neuronal cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activation and the function of tPA and uPA are less understood in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, changes in tPA and uPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in rat brain tissue after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and in the neuronal cell line, PC12 cells, during the hypoxic stimulation were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was induced by advancing a filament into the internal carotid artery in 36 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic cerebral cortex and contralateral cortex of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area, and bilateral hippocampus were collected at 0 (controls), 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> was induced in PC12 cells with a multigas incubator (set to 1% O2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction acted as a measurement of alteration in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of tPA and uPA were significantly increased after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the ischemic cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the increase in tPA and uPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 24 h after occlusion was twice the value in sham-operated rat (0 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increases of tPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were time-dependent in insult and contralateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase of uPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also seen in the hippocampus bilaterally, although the increase was more significant on the ipsilateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In PC12 cells, necrotic (approximately 35%) and apoptotic cells (approximately 65%) could be distinguished by hypoxic stimulus for 24 h, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for tPA was significantly increased for 6 h-12 h, while the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for uPA was not detected at any point in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> might result in the activation of these proteases not only in the insult but also in the contralateral brain tissue </plain></SENT>
