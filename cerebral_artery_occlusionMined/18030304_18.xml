<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the impact of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)) on dystroglycan expression by murine endothelial cells and astrocytes grown on vascular matrix laminin, perlecan, or collagen and the impact of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on alphabeta-dystroglycan within cerebral microvessels of the nonhuman primate were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dystroglycan was expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral microvessels in cortical gray and white matter, and the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to basal lamina proteins was managed in part by alpha-dystroglycan, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly reduced expression of dystroglycan both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, dystroglycan and integrin alpha6beta4 expressions on astrocyte end-feet decreased in parallel both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rapid loss of astrocyte dystroglycan during OGD appears protease-dependent, involving an matrix metalloproteinase-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may explain the rapid detachment of astrocytes from the microvascular basal lamina during ischemic injury, which could contribute to significant changes in microvascular integrity </plain></SENT>
