<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Male SD rats(n = 29) were subjected to 2 hours' middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were killed at various times of reperfusion (0.5-48 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histological features of neuronal changes, the macrophagic response and the relationship between them were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurons underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes(shrinking or swollen), and the pyknotic apoptotic neurons were occasionally seen within 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of apoptotic neurons increased with recirculation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scattered red neurons and ghost cells were first found at 6 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many apoptotic neurons, apoptotic bodies were detected in the penumbra of ischemic core at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lectin histochemistry with GSI-B4 was performed to observe the macrophage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed the active microglia and macrophage from meninges presented at 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The macrophages from parenchyma vessels appeared at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reactive microglia and extrinsic macrophage aggregated into the band of macrophage which phagocytized the apoptotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that, firstly, it is important to prevent the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reduce the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients; secondly, irreversible neuronal lesions simultaneously stimulate microglial activation and the presence of extrinsic macrophages from meninges was earlier than the appearance of the macrophages from parenchyma blood-monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors also suggest that the data on the neuronal changes over time after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion be useful reference materials for selecting the most timely medication to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
