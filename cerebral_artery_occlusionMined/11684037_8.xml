<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the macroscopic labeling pattern for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three antibodies colocalized with the ischemic core and penumbra which was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> histological evaluation in adjacent sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> induced prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in earlier infarction which correlated with increased immunoreactivity for iNOS, MnSOD and nitrotyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the penumbral region of the frontal cortex, labeling of specific cell structures was largely limited to cortical neurons near the corpus callosum and was apparent earlier in the hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in blood vessels was observed at 24 h in the hyperglycemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At both of the recovery times studied, we observed only minor vascular staining for nitrotyrosine and none for iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> resulting in an early and concomitant increase in both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production which can lead to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation that then nitrates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It would appear that hyperglycemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> contributes to the early induction of key enzymes involved in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> bioavailability </plain></SENT>
