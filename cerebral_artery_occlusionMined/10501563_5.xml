<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was induced in the extensive regions of cerebral cortex, medial striatum, and distant areas such as the ipsilateral lateral septal nucleus, bilateral hippocampal formation and contralateral amygdala following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampal formation, it was induced in the granule cell layer and the stratum pyramidale at 1 h and in the molecular layer and in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum bilaterally at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK-801 pretreatment strongly attenuated the induction of Arc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that Arc may play an important role in the neuronal plasticity through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> activation following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
