<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>) steady-state method in baboons, immediately before (T0), 1 (T1), and 3-4 (T2) h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At T1, there was a marked fall in both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the CBF/cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio in the occluded territory; these changes were sustained at T2, indicating stable reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure and lack of spontaneous reperfusion within this time range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with preocclusion conditions, the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the occluded territory was elevated at both T1 and T2, indicative of a persistent oligemia/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for up to 3 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At T2, however, this OEF increase had lessened, concomitantly with a decline in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This impairment of oxidative metabolism occurred earlier in the deep, compared with the cortical, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories; in the latter, the CMRO2 was essentially preserved at T1 and only moderately reduced at T2, possibly suggesting prolonged viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, no significant changes in CBF or CMRO2 were observed in the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in this time range after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite methodological limitations (mainly partial volume effects related to PET imaging, which may have resulted in an underestimation of true changes and an overlooking of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> changes) our study demonstrates the feasibility of the combined PET-MCAO paradigm in baboons; this experimental approach should be valuable in investigating the pathophysiology and therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
