<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intermittent peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>), which spread from the vicinity of the infarction over the cortex, have been reported in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These depolarizations resemble cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> except that they damage the cortex and enlarge the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume possibly because of compromised oxygen delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the noninvasive technique of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the identification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> and to evaluate its capability for further pathophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used male <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-anesthetized Wistar rats (n = 10) in which middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had been performed with a surgical thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a drop in parietally measured regional cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) to 31 +/- 8% of baseline flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six +/- 4 minutes after the induction of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 5 +/- 2 direct current deflections were recorded during a one-hour measurement period which may be regarded as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measuring regional cerebral blood oxygenation changes with a NIRO 500 revealed dynamic concentration changes in the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23240">chromophores</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> [HbO2], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> [Hb], and the oxidized form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> aa3 [CytO] during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typically, an initial slight decrease of [HbO2] (-6.1 +/- 1.7 arbitrary units [AU] and an increase of [Hb] (+11.5 +/- 7.7 AU) were followed by an increase of [HbO2] (+10.8 +/- 4.7 AU) and a decrease of [Hb] (-4.7 +/- 5.5 AU); [CytO] decreased during the depolarizations (-2.0 +/- 1.2 AU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NIRS can detect typical <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>-associated changes in blood oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that during the course of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>, unlike "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, hypoxygenation precedes hyperoxygenation of the microcirculation in a given cortex volume as the depolarization wave propagates through hemodynamically compromised to intact tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This would accord with the known damaging effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NIRS "fingerprint" of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> encourages the search for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> during early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
