<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty male SD rats were randomly assigned to 5 equal groups: control group undergoing middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h only without any preconditioning; 3 WIN 55, 212 - 2 preconditioning groups (WIN1-3) injected intraperitoneally with WIN 55, 212 - 2 at the doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg respectively 24 h before MCAO for 2 h, and DMSO group injected intraperitoneally with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), solvent of WIN 55, 212 - 2 24 h before MCAO for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>24, 48, and 72 hours after reperfusion the neurological function score (NFS) was evaluated the rats were then decapitated with their brains taken out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was evaluated with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NFS values of the rats in WIN 55, 212 - 2 preconditioning groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher than those of the control and DMSO groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) while the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of the WIN 55, 212 - 2 preconditioning groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly smaller than those of the control and DMSO groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of the WIN2 and WIN3 groups were both significantly smaller than that of the WIN1 group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume between WIN2 and WIN3 groups (P = 0.928) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WIN 55, 212 - 2 preconditioning has neuroprotective effect on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
