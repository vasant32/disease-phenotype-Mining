<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted the study in the Department of Pharmacology and in cooperation with Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital and the Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq from October 2003 to May 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients presented with neurological deficits of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and we also enrolled 20 healthy individuals to serve as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained venous blood samples from each patient after 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and each healthy individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the serum level of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> were significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher in patients (103.9 +/- 40.2 umol and 2.7 +/- 0.6 umol) than in healthy individuals (53.3 +/- 20.7 umol and 2.3 +/- 0.2 umol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> directly correlated with nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in healthy individuals (r=0.84), and patients (r=0.514) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum intermediate nitrogen species; nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> were significantly increased after 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation from nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
