<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) show <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> that is generally regarded as resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex rather than the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether MCAO induces hippocampal damage and whether this contributes to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive defects</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the hippocampal damage and its correlation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive defects</z:hpo> after exclusively unilateral MCAO and the underlying mechanism for that damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were assessed for hippocampal damage by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and the Mini Mental-Status Evaluation (MMSE) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) were used to assess for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We provide the first evidence that patients with exclusively unilateral MCAO showed hippocampal damage characterized by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-size-independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and alterations in neuronal and glial metabolites in the ipsilateral hippocampus, in parallel with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rodent MCAO also induced delayed shrinkage and pyramidal neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ipsilateral hippocampus and an impairment of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blocking Gap junctional communication (GJC) with carbenoxolone or downregulation of connexin43 (Cx43) significantly increased the survival of the pyramidal neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus and improved behavioral scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Cx43 heterozygous mice showed reduced shrinkage and metabolite abnormality in ipsilateral hippocampus after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Astroglial GJC plays a significant role in MCAO-induced remote hippocampal damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It might be possible to improve the cognition in patients with MCAO by manipulating interastrocytic communication via the gap junction channels </plain></SENT>
