<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor activation and selective inhibition of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase with 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) on blood flow to collateral-dependent tissue (CDT) after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A left craniotomy was performed in each of 11 dogs with the animals under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded and cannulated distally for determination of CDT, using a "shadow flow" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vascular pressures were measured and used to calculate vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Our shadow flow model has the ability to identify an area of CDT, with minimal contamination from overlap flow within a morphologically identified "risk area" for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> increased blood flow to CDT by 56.2%, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ipsilateral and contralateral cerebrum increased by at least 35% from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>7-NI caused a significant drop in regional CBF, with the greatest drop of 41.7% occurring in the CDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> ipsilateral and contralateral CBF was reduced by 31.7 and 23.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dilator response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> was significantly attenuated after 7-NI administration, except in CDT where flow increased ("inverse steal") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vascular resistance decreased in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and increased with 7-NI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production seems to play an important role in regulating vascular tone and CBF to CDT after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selective preservation of blood flow to CDT seems to be mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation but independent of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
