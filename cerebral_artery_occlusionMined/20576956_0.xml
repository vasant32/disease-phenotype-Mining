<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In humans and rodents, cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can lead to cortex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the rodent, fetal brain neural precursors or stem cell-derived neurons grafted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-lesioned brain integrate successfully and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the fate, in the long term, of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors grafted after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Green fluorescent protein-labeled neural precursors were grafted in the striatum of control and lesioned mice and their fate examined 9 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control mice, the neuronal progeny of mouse embryonic stem cells innervated distant brain structures, in a way remarkably similar between animals, displayed a laterality preference and remained polysialated neural cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-immunoreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In lesioned mice, grafted cells were expelled out of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-related brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and reshaping were not prevented by cell grafting and, eventually, led to the expulsion of the graft </plain></SENT>
