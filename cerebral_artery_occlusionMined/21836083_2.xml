<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The formation of reactive astrocytes is common after central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injuries such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling pathway(s) that control astrocyte formation and functions are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assess the effects of Notch 1 signaling in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-reactive astrocytes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined reactive astrocyte formation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area 3 days after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without γ-secretase inhibitor treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To directly study the effects of inhibiting a γ-secretase cleavage target in reactive astrocytes, we generated glial fibrillary acidic protein-CreER™:Notch 1 conditional knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decreased the number of proliferative glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes directly adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in reactive astrocytes correlated with an increased number of CD45-positive cells that invaded into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To study the influence of reactive astrocytes on immune cell invasion, ex vivo immune cell invasion assays were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that a γ-secretase-mediated pathway in astrocytes affected Jurkat cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> treatment, glial fibrillary acidic protein-CreER™:Notch 1 conditional knockout mice had a significantly decreased number of proliferating reactive astrocytes and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi> treatment also led to an increased number of CD45-positive cells that invaded the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that proliferating and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes are regulated by Notch 1 signal transduction and control immune cell invasion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
