<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Synaptic pathology is observed during hypoxic events in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in the form of altered dendrite structure and conductance changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations are rapidly reversible, on the return of normoxia, but are thought to initiate subsequent neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on regulators of synaptic stability, we examined the temporal expression of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (CAMs) in synaptosomes after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We focused on events preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (&lt;48 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synaptosome preparations were enriched in synaptically localized proteins and were free of endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed that the synaptosome preparation was enriched in spheres (approximately 650 nm in diameter) containing secretory vesicles and postsynaptic densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of synaptically located CAMs was unaffected at 3 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is contrasted by the observation of consistent downregulation of synaptic CAMs at 20 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examination of synaptosomal CAM protein content indicated that certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were decreased as early as 3 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For comparison, synaptosomal Agrn protein levels were unaffected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a marked increase in the levels of p-Ctnnb1 in ischemic synaptosomes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p-Ctnnb1 was detected in hippocampal fiber tracts and in cornu ammonis 1 neuronal nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induces a dysregulation of a subset of synaptic proteins that are important regulators of synaptic plasticity before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
