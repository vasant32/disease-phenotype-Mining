<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional diets may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in patients with neurological injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect on the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of replacing carbohydrates as the primary dietary source of nonprotein calories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine Long-Evans rats were either fasted for 24 hours, fed isocaloric amounts of a control diet containing 51.5% of the calories as carbohydrates, or fed one of five experimental diets before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the experimental diets, 60% of the carbohydrate calories were replaced with one or more of the following substrates: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52683">1,3-butanediol</z:chebi>, triacetin, tributyrin, and long- and medium-chain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration in the fasted animals was 6.4 +/- 1.1 mumol/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the animals receiving the control diet, which contained the greatest number of carbohydrate calories, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 9.1 +/- 1.4 mumol/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52683">1,3-butanediol</z:chebi> diet resulted in an intermediate plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration averaging 7.8 +/- 1.3 mumol/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated in the fasted group and with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52683">1,3-butanediol</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> levels were increased with the diets supplemented with triacetin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The smallest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (53 +/- 43 mm3) was found in the fasted group and the largest (162 +/- 56 mm3) in the control diet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes that were significantly smaller were found with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52683">1,3-butanediol</z:chebi> diet (98 +/- 41 mm3) and with the triacetin/tributyrin diet (105 +/- 53 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was directly related to the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (n = 69, r = 0.47, p less than 0.01), but not to plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> body, or <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to develop a diet for patients with neurological injuries using noncarbohydrate calorie sources, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52683">1,3-butanediol</z:chebi>, triacetin, or tributyrin, that would supply systemic caloric and protein requirements without the adverse effect of conventional diets </plain></SENT>
