<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed the following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1) In db/db mice, the basal level of cEPCs was less and cMVDs were lower, but the levels of circulating EPC-MPs and EMPs were more; 2) MCAO induced a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and less of an increase in cEPCs in db/db mice; 3) the level of cEPCs correlated with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration (negatively), cMVD (positively), and ischemic damage (negatively), but the levels of EPC-MPs and EMPs correlated inversely with those parameters; 4) EPCs were reduced and dysfunctional in db/db mice, and preincubation with db/db MPs impaired EPC functions; and 5) infusion of EPCs preincubated with db/+ MPs increased the level of cEPCs and reduced ischemic damage, and these beneficial effects were reduced or lost in EPCs preincubated with db/db MPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that reduced cEPCs, impaired EPC generation/function, and increased production of MPs might be the mechanisms responsible for increased ischemic damage seen in db/db mice </plain></SENT>
