<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured by using 2, 3, 5 triphenylte trazolinm <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining, and Epo protein and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that after reperfusion, Epo was found to be expressed extensively in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was most apparent in the basal nuclei and hippocampus, and was, to some extent, present in cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with 3-NPA caused a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of both Epo protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased significantly in the different brain areas in the 3-NPA pretreated group as compared with the non-pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that preconditioning with low dose 3-NPA could induce ischemic tolerance and neuro-protective effects by increasing the Epo expression in the ischemic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related areas </plain></SENT>
