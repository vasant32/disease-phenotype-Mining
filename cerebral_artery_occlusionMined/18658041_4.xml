<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hsp110/105 belongs to the HSP110 heat shock protein family, which is a subgroup of the HSP70 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mammals, Hsp110/105 is constitutively expressed but exhibits particularly high levels in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that both Hsp110/105 and Hsp70 are elevated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the physiological role of this protein in vivo, we generated hsp110/105 knockout (KO) mice and investigate the effect of reduced Hsp110/105 levels on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: hsp110/105 KO and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were subjected to 30 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological scores were measured and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Hsp70 chaperone activity of thermally denatured firefly luciferase was measured in hsp110/105 KO embryonic fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit scores were significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced in hsp110/105 KO mice compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, hsp110/105 KO embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a dose-dependent suppression of Hsp70 chaperone activity by the presence of Hsp110/105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that hsp110/105 KO mice are resistant to ischemic injury and that the protective effects of hsp110/105 deficiency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may partly be mediated by an increase in the chaperone activity of Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
