<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution and time course of the induction of MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were similar in the two MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not detected in the sham-operated rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced by MCAO with the peak of expression at 4-6 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion, and the signals of MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were observed in the ischemic core region at an earlier time point, and thereafter intensely in the penumbra of the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signals of MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were evident on Mac-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-positive cells, but not on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-positive cells, indicating that MIP-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced in microglia/macrophages of the rat brain after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
