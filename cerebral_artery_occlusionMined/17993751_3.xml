<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in four healthy beagle dogs using <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> plugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They showed neurological signs of forebrain dysfunction such as reduced responsiveness, head turning, <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp>, postural reaction deficits, perceptual deficits, and hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These signs gradually regressed within 4 weeks without therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On magnetic resonance imaging, T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity were found in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These lesions were well-defined and sharply demarcated from adjacent brain parenchyma with a homogenous appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002921'>abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, atrophic and necrotic lesions were observed in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus were partially unstained with triphenyl- tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, typical features of infarction were identified in cortical and thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that our canine model resembles the conditions of real <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
