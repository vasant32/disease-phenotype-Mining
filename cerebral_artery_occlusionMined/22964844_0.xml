<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hyperintense vessels (HVs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) are frequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of HVs represents altered blood flow from collaterals distal to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of HVs in AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location and extent of the HVs was determined by FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained and compared between patients with different grades of HVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the relationship between distal HVs and leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs) was assessed using angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HVs were observed in 41 (75.9%) of the 54 patients enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial NIHSS score was lower (p&lt;0.001) and the infarction volume was smaller (p&lt;0.001) in patients with distal HVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusting of other factors, regression analysis revealed that distal HVs are an independent predictor of a favorable outcome at 90 days (p=0.006; OR 0.049; 95% CI 0.006-0.420) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of distal HVs was correlated with the presence of LMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Distal HVs may be a marker for LMCs and act as a predictor of a favorable clinical outcome for patients with AIS </plain></SENT>
