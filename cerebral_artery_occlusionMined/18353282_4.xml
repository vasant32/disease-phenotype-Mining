<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether delayed treatment with exogenous kallikrein enhances neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after focal cortical infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone renovascular hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human tissue kallikrein (1.6 x 10(-2) PNAU/kg) or vehicle was given through a tail vein daily for 6 consecutive days starting 24 h after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was examined by using 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14 or 28 d after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with kallikrein significantly increased the number of BrdU(+) cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the peri-infarction region initiating 3 d after MCAO compared with the vehicle group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein significantly increased the number of BrdU(+)/DCX(+) cells and BrdU(+)/nestin(+) cells in the SVZ as well as vascular density in the peri-infarction region compared with the vehicle group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05), which increased at 3 d, peaked at 7-14 d after MCAO, and then gradually decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein markedly increased the number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in the peri-infarction region compared with the vehicle group at 14 d and 28 d after MCAO (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The kallikrein group showed better functional improvement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that delayed administration of kallikrein at 24 h after cortical infarction promotes the SVZ neuroblasts proliferation, migration, and selective differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, kallikrein enhanced endogenous neurogenesis is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, both attributing to functional improvement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, kallikrein may have a potential therapeutic perspective on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
