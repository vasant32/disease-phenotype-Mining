<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the protective effect of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage induced by reperfusion following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was performed by inserting a nylon suture into intracranial segment of internal carotid artery to block the origin of middle cerebral artery and reperfusion by withdrawing the nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permeability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was determined by extravasation of the protein-bound Evans blue dye to cerebral cortex and further evaluated by immunohistochemical or electronmicroscopic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reperfusion for 3 h following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 3 h produced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage which exhibited the increase in extravasation in cerebral cortex, elevation of the expression of immunoglobulin (IgG), and pore formation in endothelial cell membrane of capillary in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NBP (5-20 mg.kg-1) decreased the extravasation in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of IgG in cerebral cortex was decreased and the ultrastructure damage of capillaries was alleviated after treatment with NBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NBP 20 mg.kg-1 also alleviated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> caused by 3-h reperfusion following 3-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBP has protective effect on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage induced by reperfusion after MCAO </plain></SENT>
