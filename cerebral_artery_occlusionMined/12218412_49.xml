<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors examined <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels for several important genes associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at five time points (3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours) after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sensitive and quantitative technique (TaqMan real-time QRT-PCR) was used to simultaneously measure <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for key cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression increased significantly in the injured hemisphere for interleukin (IL)-1beta (12-fold increase at 24 hours), IL-6 (25-fold increase at 6 hours) and ICAM-1 (4-fold increase at 24 hours), and the interhemispheric differences for these genes were significant for every time point examined (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 mRNA levels did not respond differentially to injury at any time point between the two brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points examined, activated NF-kappaB immunoreactivity was observed in cells throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-damaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the proinflammatory properties of the induced molecules, which are involved in the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, and may thus contribute to secondary cellular responses that lead to further brain damage </plain></SENT>
