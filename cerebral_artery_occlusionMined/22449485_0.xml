<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into four experimental main groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First main group which was comprised four subgroups, were exposed to 90% HO for 6 days, 4 hours per day and subjected to 60 minutes of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) after 2, 5, 10, and 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second group acted as control, was exposed to 21% oxygen (RA; room air) in the same chamber, and subjected to 60 minutes of right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Third main group comprised two subgroups, were exposed to 90% HO for 6 days, 4 hours per day, received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (NS; 2HO+NS) and dimethylthiourea (DT) just before inhaling 90% HO (2HO+DT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forth main group was exposed to 21% oxygen (2RA) in the same chamber and received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (2RA+NS) and DT just before inhaling 21% oxygen (2RA+DT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Last two main groups were subjected to 60 minutes of right MCAO after 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24-hour reperfusion, neurological deficit score (NDS), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, brain water content, and Evans blue extravasations were assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First main group compared with the RA group, NDS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, Brain water content, and Evans blue extravasations were reduced in 2, 5, and 10 days significantly, whereas there was no difference among groups 2HO+DT, 2RA+DT, and 2RA+NS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> preconditioning induced effective but transient neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
