<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ambivalent effects of interleukin-6 on the pathogenesis of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date, the long-term actions of interleukin-6 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we subjected interleukin-6 knockout (IL-6(-/-)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control mice to mild brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> by 30-min filamentous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While ischaemic tissue damage was comparable at early time points, IL-6(-/-) mice showed significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion volumes as well as worse long-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, IL-6(-/-) mice displayed an impaired angiogenic response to brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> with reduced numbers of newly generated endothelial cells and decreased density of perfused microvessels along with lower absolute regional cerebral blood flow and reduced vessel responsivity in ischaemic striatum at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the early genomic activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related gene networks was strongly reduced and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was almost absent in IL-6(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, systemic neoangiogenesis was impaired in IL-6(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of interleukin-6 competent bone marrow into IL-6(-/-) mice (IL-6(chi)) did not rescue interleukin-6 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression or the early transcriptional activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in IL-6(chi) mice recapitulated the major effects of interleukin-6 deficiency on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> regeneration with significantly enhanced lesion volumes and reduced vessel densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional in vitro experiments yielded complementary evidence, which showed that after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> resident brain cells serve as the major source of interleukin-6 in a self-amplifying network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of primary cortical neurons, mixed glial cultures or immortalized brain endothelia with interleukin 6-induced robust interleukin-6 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcription in each case, whereas oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation of organotypic brain slices resulted in strong upregulation of interleukin-6 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> along with increased transcription of key <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, interleukin-6 produced locally by resident brain cells promotes post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and thereby affords long-term histological and functional protection </plain></SENT>
