<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AMPK is elevated under ischemic conditions, but the role of AMPK in ischemic brain remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effects of AMPK inhibition using both pharmacological and genetic approaches in an in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice as well as mice deficient in one of the isoforms of the catalytic subunit of AMPK, AMPK alpha-1 or alpha-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AMPK inhibition was neuroprotective after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient in AMPK alpha-2 demonstrated significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates, whereas deletion of AMPK alpha-1 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of a major upstream regulator of AMPK, LKB1, was also induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AMPK activation is detrimental in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AMPK catalytic isoform alpha-2 contributes to the deleterious effects of AMPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AMPK inhibition leads to neuroprotection even when these agents are administered poststroke </plain></SENT>
