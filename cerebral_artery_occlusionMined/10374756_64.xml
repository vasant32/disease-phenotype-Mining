<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAO) in the rat to investigate VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein localization, and VEGFR-1 mRNA and VEGFR-2 mRNA expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By nonradioactive in situ hybridization we observed upregulation of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and VEGFR-1 mRNA, but not of VEGFR-2 mRNA in the hemisphere ipsilateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated in the periphery of the ischemic area commencing 3 hours (h) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO, reached a peak after 24 h, and remained expressed at lower levels until 7 days (d) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double labelling experiments revealed that the majority of VEGF expressing cells in the penumbra and within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were immunoreactive for Ox-42, Iba-1, and Ed1, but not for GFAP and neurofilament proteins, suggesting that microglial cells/macrophages are the major cell type expressing VEGE Since VEGF was also expressed in Ox-42 immunoreactive cells distant from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (e.g. in the corpus callosum and hippocampus), activated microglial cells expressing VEGF may migrate towards the ischemic stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF protein was also detected on capillaries within the peri-ischemic area, suggesting that VEGF produced and secreted by microglial cells/macrophages binds to its receptors on nearby vascular endothelial cells and initiates an angiogenic response which counterbalances tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuroectodermal cells in the penumbra was highly depressed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spatial and temporal correlation between the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> with VEGF and VEGFR-1 expression suggests that the ischemic upregulation of VEGF represents a physiological response of the brain to counterbalance <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in order to protect neuroectodermal tissue </plain></SENT>
