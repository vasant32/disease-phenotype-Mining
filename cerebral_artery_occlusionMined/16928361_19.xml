<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the dose, route and time of administration in relation to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, VEGF can improve histological outcome and sensorimotor function in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, VEGF also increases vascular permeability, which can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and exacerbate ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, although VEGF is a candidate therapeutic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other ischemic disorders, its benefit relative to risk is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering that functional rather than histological measures of outcome are probably most relevant to therapeutic prospects for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the effects of VEGF after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats using a series of behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report that VEGF improves functional outcome in ischemic rats, including both sensorimotor and cognitive deficiencies </plain></SENT>
