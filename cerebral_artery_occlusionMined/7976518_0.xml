<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into non-treated (control; n = 9), four-vessel occlusion (4VO; 30-30 minutes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and recirculation, n = 5), and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO, n = 3) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MVs were passed through nylon meshes and were obtained by ultracentrifuge at 58000 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Na,K-ATPase activity in MVs was determined by the phosphomolybdate method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DiC8 enhanced Na,K-ATPase activity at 10(-4) M in the control group, the 4VO group and the contralateral hemispheres of the MCAO group (139% +/- 0.06, 135% +/- 0.2, 133% +/- 0.18, mean +/- SE, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum) respectively, but had no effects on MVs in the ipsilateral hemispheres of MCAO group (74% +/- 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activation by diC8 was inhibited by PKC inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> (3 x 10(8) M) and H7 (10(-6) M) in the control MVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> suppressed Na, K-ATPase at 10(-5) M in the control group (-25% +/- 0.07), but it tended to activate Na,K-ATPase activity in the ipsilateral hemispheres of the MCAO groups (33% +/- 0.09) </plain></SENT>
