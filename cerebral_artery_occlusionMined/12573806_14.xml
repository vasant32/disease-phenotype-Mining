<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that AT2Rs are increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may contribute effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this, we have examined the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R), AT2R and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> levels in the brain 24 h after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The densities of AT1R and AT2R were measured by quantitative autoradiography (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (n=6) and by immunohistochemistry (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AT1R levels on autoradiography showed a significant decrease (0.87+/-0.06 to 1.39+/-0.07 fmol/mg, p&lt;0.01) in the ventral cortex of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> side compared to the cortices of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NS) rats (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference on ATIR in the contralateral verbal cortex of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats compared to NS control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, levels of AT2R in the ventral cortex of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the contralateral sides were significantly increased (0.77+/-0.06, p&lt;0.05 and 0.91+/-0.05, p&lt;0.01 compared to 0.60+/-0.03 fmol/mg tissue, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIA showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> in the ventral cortex of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the contralateral sides were significantly increased (241.63+/-47.72, p&lt;0.01 and 165.51+/-42.59, p&lt;0.05 compared to 76.80+/-4.10 pg/g tissue, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> in the hypothalamus was significantly increased (179.50+/-17.49 to 118.50+/-6.65 pg/g tissue, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> and AT2Rs are increased whereas AT1Rs are decreased after transient MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> and AT2R are activated and may contribute neural effects to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
