<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models induced by injection of homologous clots into the internal carotid artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> closely mimic human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and have been commonly used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies indicate that the size and composition of clots are critical for the reproducibility of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we modified the homologous clots formation by addition of thrombin and fibrinogen which produced even distribution of fibrin with tight cross linkage of red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We optimized the embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model in rats using different size of the mixed clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A precise lodgment of the clots at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation and highly reproducible ischemic lesion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory were demonstrated in the embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model induced by injection of 10 pieces of 1-mm long mixed clots made in PE-60 catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further tested the effect of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in this embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rtPA induced thrombolysis, improved neurological outcome, and significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume when administered at 1h after embolism as compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have established a reproducible embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model using clots made of homologous blood, thrombin and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mixed clots enable precise lodgment at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation which is responsive to thrombolytic therapy of rtPA </plain></SENT>
