<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry is a new technique, it allows one to continuously measure blood flow in small tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare laser Doppler flowmetry with hydrogen clearance using a new single fiber probe to obtain measurements in deep brain structures and then to show the temporal profile of cerebral blood flow during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, the single fiber laser Doppler method was compared with the hydrogen clearance method in ten Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was induced in fifteen Wistar rats using a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> based on the intravascular insertion of a nylon suture; reperfusion occurred after withdrawal of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The laser Doppler probe was placed in the lateral caudatoputamen, and local cerebral blood flow was measured continuously before and during occlusion as well as after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative blood flow values obtained by the laser Doppler method and the hydrogen clearance method showed a good correlation (r = 0.76) and a linear relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rapid decrease in laser Doppler flowmetry to 42 +/- 16% of former baseline values was seen with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery; during occlusion cerebral blood flow remained at this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion resulted in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of cerebral blood flow as laser Doppler flowmetry values ranged from 25% to 134% of baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion on cerebral blood flow can be monitored on-line with laser Doppler flowmetry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
