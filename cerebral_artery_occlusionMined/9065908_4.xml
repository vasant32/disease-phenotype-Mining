<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion measurements were made using dynamic first-pass bolus tracking of a susceptibility contrast agent, whereas rCBF was measured using radioactive microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two simple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion parameters, the maximum change in R2* (m delta R2*) and time delay to m delta R2* (t delta R2*), were derived from the signal intensity versus time curves on a pixel-to-pixel basis, without applying curve-fitting procedures or tracer kinetic theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each hemisphere, m delta R2* and t delta R2* were compared with the rCBF measurements in four selected regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> bolus tracking series were performed in 12 rats with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the individual series there was a significant correlation (.0001 &lt; or = p &lt; or = .02) between m delta R2* and the microsphere rCBF measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging from .784 to .983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pooling the m delta R2* data resulted in a correlation coefficient of .809 (p = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a nonlinear correlation between the t delta R2* and rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both parameters there was considerable variation between different measurements regarding both the slope of the regression line and its intercept with the y-axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results justify the use of m delta R2* as a relative measure of perfusion during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the interindividual variation, calibration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion measurements for the estimation of absolute flow values must be considered unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The t delta R2* may have physiological relevance as a marker of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
