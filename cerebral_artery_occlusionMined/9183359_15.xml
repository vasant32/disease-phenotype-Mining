<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A novel glycine receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ZD9379, was studied in 70 Sprague-Dawley rats using the suture occlusion model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, 20 rats received an initial bolus of vehicle or 10 mg/kg ZD9379 (n = 10 in each group) 30 minutes after MCAO, followed by a continuous infusion of the same dose per hour for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI with echo-planar acquisition was used to generate maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second experiment, 50 rats were assigned to five groups: vehicle and 10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mg/kg ZD9379 (n = 10 in each group) with the same dosing protocol but no imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both experiments, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first experiment, before therapy was begun, there was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-derived ischemic lesion volume between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over time, the 10-mg/kg ZD9379-treated rats had a significant delayed regional recovery of reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the peripheral parietal cortex (P = .0156) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postmortem corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 hours after MCAO was significantly smaller in the group treated with 10 mg/kg ZD9379 than in the vehicle group (119.2 +/- 52.2 versus 211.2 +/- 50.0 mm3 [mean +/- SD]; P = .0008; a reduction of 43.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, postmortem corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in rats receiving 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/kg ZD9379 were significantly smaller than in those receiving vehicle, a reduction of 42.6%, 51.4%, and 42.9%, respectively (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 2.5- to 10-mg/kg doses of ZD9379 initiated 30 minutes after MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diffusion mapping disclosed a delayed treatment effect of this glycine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, confirmed by the postmortem study </plain></SENT>
