<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HMGB1 is a nuclear protein and an alarmin that signals cell damage in response to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that after release from injured cells, HMGB1 binds to its receptors to stimulate cross-talk among cells and to drive components of the inflammatory cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was intended to investigate the role of extracellular HMGB1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> by examining the response of the zymogen matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to HMGB1 in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), and MMP-9 expression was examined using quantitative RT-PCR in primary cultured neurons, astrocytes, and mouse brain after HMGB1 addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 expression/activity was examined using zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 60 minutes using a filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR4 is constitutively expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 addition to neuronal and glial cell cultures caused MMP-9 upregulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lack of TLR4 function attenuated MMP-9 expression induced by HMGB1 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After striatal microinjection of HMGB1, MMP-9 was upregulated, and the response was independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, MMP-9 upregulation was reduced in TLR4 missense mutant mice after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls, as was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HMGB1 triggers MMP-9 upregulation in neurons and astrocytes predominantly via TLR4 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, targeting HMGB1/TLRs signaling pathway may reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and reduce tissue damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
