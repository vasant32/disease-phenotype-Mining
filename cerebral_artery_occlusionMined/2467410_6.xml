<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used 44 splenectomized dogs to study the effects of isovolemic hemodilution with a crystalloid solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dogs were randomly divided into a hemodilution and a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each group, 17 dogs were subjected to 6 hours of internal carotid and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and five dogs received sham operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isovolemic hemodilution by phlebotomy and Ringer's <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> infusion was performed 30 minutes after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and resulted in an average hematocrit of 32-33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodilution significantly reduced viscosity, fibrinogen and total protein concentrations, and plasma oncotic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic arterial blood pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased slightly with hemodilution, but central venous pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a similar decrease in cardiac index in both hemodiluted and control dogs, which may have been due to the effects of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracranial pressure increased</z:e> significantly with time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, but this increase was significantly more severe in the hemodiluted dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific gravity, measured just after the dogs were killed, 6 hours after hemodilution, was significantly lower in the white matter and basal ganglia of the left (ischemic) hemisphere in hemodiluted dogs than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow decreased significantly in the left hemisphere after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This decrease was almost completely reversed by hemodilution except in the basal ganglia, where the increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> caused by hemodilution was the greatest </plain></SENT>
