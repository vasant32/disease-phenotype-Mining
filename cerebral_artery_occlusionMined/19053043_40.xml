<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the microglial response associated with ischemic injury extends into SVZ and influences neuroblast production is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate increased numbers of activated microglia in ipsilateral SVZ concomitant with neuroblast migration into the striatum at 2, 6, and 16 weeks, with maximum at 6 weeks, following 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> striatum, numbers of activated microglia peaked already at 2 weeks and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microglia in SVZ were resident or originated from bone marrow, with maximum proliferation during the first 2 weeks postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SVZ, microglia exhibited ramified or intermediate <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, signifying a downregulated inflammatory profile, whereas amoeboid or round phagocytic microglia were frequent in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numbers of microglia expressing markers of antigen-presenting cells (MHC-II, CD86) increased in SVZ but very few lymphocytes were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative PCR, strong short- and long-term increase (at 1 and 6 weeks postinfarct) of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene expression was detected in SVZ tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated numbers of IGF-1-expressing microglia were found in SVZ at 2, 6, and 16 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 16 weeks, 5% of microglia but no other cells in SVZ expressed the IGF-1 protein, which mitigates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and promotes proliferation and differentiation of NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term accumulation of microglia with proneurogenic phenotype in the SVZ implies a supportive role of these cells for the continuous neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
