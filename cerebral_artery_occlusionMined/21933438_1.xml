<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial (IA) administration of rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has the potential for greater thrombolytic efficacy, especially for a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the M1 or M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) is a concern with IA or intravenous (IV) administration especially as the therapeutic window is extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because IA administration delivers a higher local concentration of agent, the incidence and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> may be greater than with similar doses IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the safety of rt-PA administration by IA compared to IV infusion following 6 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAo) with reflow in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male SHRs were subjected to 6 hours MCAo with 18 hours reflow using a snare ligature model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were treated with IA saline, IA rt-PA (1, 5, 10, 30 mg/kg), or IV rt-PA (10 and 30 mg/kg) by a 10 to 60 minute infusion beginning approximately 1 minute before reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were recovered for 24 hours after MCAo <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at which time <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> Score, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and Modified Bederson Score were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater hemorrhagic transformation occurred with 10 and 30 mg/kg rt-PA administered IA than IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IV 10 mg/kg rt-PA dosage induced significantly less <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> than did the 1 or 5 mg/kg IA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed after IA or IV treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with 30 mg/kg rt-PA by either the IA or IV route had greater neurological dysfunction compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of rt-PA by the IA route following 6 hours of MCAo results in greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and worse functional recovery than comparable dosages IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was observed when the IA dose was a tenth of the IV dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> did not translate in larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
