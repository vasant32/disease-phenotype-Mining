<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intravenously delivered human mesenchymal stem cells (SH2+, SH3+, CD34-, and CD45-) immortalized with a human-telomerase gene (hTERT-MSCs) and transfected with eGFP or LacZ into rats 12 h after induction of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), to study their potential therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>hTERT-MSCs were delivered at 12 h after lesion induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was assessed using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and spectroscopy, and histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and a treadmill test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous delivery of hTERT-MSCs reduced lesion volume and the magnitude of the reduction and functional improvement was positively correlated with the number of cells injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction of lesion size could be assessed in vivo with MRI and MRS and was correlated with subsequent histological examination of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates that highly purified hTERT-MSCs reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume and improve functional outcome </plain></SENT>
