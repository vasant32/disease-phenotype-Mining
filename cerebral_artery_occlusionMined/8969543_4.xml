<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although clinical reports concerning voiding dysfunction after cerebrovascular disease are observed, no experimental studies have been carried out using an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to establish an animal model to evaluate neurogenic voiding dysfunction associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats weighing between 250 to 350 g were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To induce regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats, 4-0 monofilament nylon thread was introduced through the left internal carotid artery into the origin of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cystometric examination was performed in conscious rats through a catheter chronically implanted into the bladder dome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in body weight and bladder capacity were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7856">oxybutynin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> on the conscious rat bladder were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By measuring the contractile response to field stimulation with added <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and alpha, beta-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi>-ATP, the proportion of muscarinergic and purinergic innervation was compared between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bladder capacity in cerebral infarcted rats was significantly decreased just after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 14, 21 and 28 days after occlusion reached less than half that in sham operated and untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bladder capacity correlated with the area of infarcted lesion determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral infarcted rats, bladder capacity significantly increased at low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7856">oxybutynin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, while in the sham operated rats bladder capacity did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although an increase in bladder capacity was observed after administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> both in cerebral infarcted and sham operated rats, a significant increase of residual urine was found and considered to be caused by decreased detrusor contraction pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> increased bladder capacity in the cerebral infarcted rats without increasing residual urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the proportion of muscarinergic and purinergic innervation between the cerebral infarcted and sham operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that calcium channel blocking agents may operate especially on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system rather than peripheral neuromuscular system, resulting in augmentation of the bladder capacity in the cerebral infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hitherto, the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7856">oxybutynin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> on the peripheral neuromuscular system is considered to be the most important, but in the cerebral infarcted rats its action on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system should also be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This type of animal model is believed to be useful to study neurogenic voiding dysfunction of human subjects with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
