<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sensitivity is still under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, SHRSP display a greater response to inflammatory stimuli than do WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because inflammatory cells may influence the extent of damage in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, this study has investigated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in SHRSP and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male SHRSP (n=5) and WKY (n=5) were anesthetized and underwent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of recovery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neutrophil counts, and activated microglia counts were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SHRSP displayed more ischemic damage than did WKY (135+/-4.7 versus 102+/-4.7 mm(3) [mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain neutrophil counts were extremely low in both strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SHRSP displayed significantly more activated microglia than did WKY in the ipsilateral hemisphere (respective SHRSP versus WKY values [mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] were 88+/-3.6 versus 51+/-3.4 per mm(2) for the cortical peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region [P&lt;0.005] and 183+/-7.9 versus 156+/-3.7 per mm(2) for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core [P&lt;0.05]) and in the contralateral hemisphere (eg, respective SHRSP versus WKY values were 102+/-3.2 versus 50+/-3.1 per mm(2) for the sensorimotor cortex [P&lt;0.0001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neutrophils and very few activated microglia were found within the brains of naive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However naive SHRSP possessed more microglia (resting and activated) than did naive WKY </plain></SENT>
