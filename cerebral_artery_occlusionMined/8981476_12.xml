<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of this <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> metabolizing enzyme indirectly enhances the actions of endogenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> without inducing cardiovascular side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such effects could limit the potential clinical application of any approach targeting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO was accomplished with a transluminal 4-0 nylon suture inserted through the common carotid artery to block blood flow at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 5dITU 30 min prior to and 5 h after MCAO resulted in a dose dependent (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant (P = 0.02) 44% reduction (control, 265 +/- 35 mm3; treated, 149 +/- 30 mm3) was observed at 0.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at the highest dose examined (1.0 mg/kg) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (i.e. post-occlusion) treatment, 5dITU was administered (0.33 mg/kg, i.v.) successively at each of 0.5, 1.75 and 3.5 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-occlusion treatment resulted in a significant (P = 0.037) 32% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (control, 314 +/- 34 mm3; treated, 212 +/- 28 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At this dose there were no apparent changes in a number of physiological parameters monitored over the period of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that intervention with an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> kinase inhibitor in an ischemic brain injury model is neuroprotective whether treatment is begun prior to or just after MCAO </plain></SENT>
