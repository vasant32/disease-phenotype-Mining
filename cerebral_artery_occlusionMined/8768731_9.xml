<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the role of thrombin in brain damage during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we investigated the effects of a selective thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, on microthrombi formation, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and neurological deficits using a rat thrombotic distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rat dMCA was occluded by a platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed after photochemical reaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and green light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One day after dMCA occlusion, the number of microthrombi were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the separate animals, rCBF was measured by using the iodoantipyrine method 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days after dMCA occlusion, behavioral tests were performed and the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, argatroban was administered i.p. by continuous infusion after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Argatroban (0.3 mg/h/rat) significantly (P &lt; .05) decreased the number of microthrombi 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Argatroban (0.1 and 0.3 mg/h/rat) significantly (P &lt; .01) reversed a decrease in rCBF 1 day after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Argatroban (0.3 mg/h/rat) also significantly (P &lt; .01) reduced the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of argatroban (0.1 and 0.3 mg/h/rat) resulted in a significant improvement in neurological deficits 3 days after dMCA occlusion (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Argatroban decreased the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and improved neurological deficits in the rat thrombotic dMCA occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects were thought to be due to the improvement of rCBF and to the reduction in secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after dMCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
