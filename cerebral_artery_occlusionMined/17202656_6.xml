<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 2 h and reperfusion was continued for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Water extract of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (WEAA) was orally administered promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the ipsilateral hemispheres of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion rats were significantly reduced by treatment with WEAA in a dose-dependent manner (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic time window of WEAA was 3 h in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WEAA also significantly inhibited increased neutrophil infiltration of ischemic brain tissue as estimated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPO-positive cells were markedly reduced by WEAA administration in striatal and cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that WEAA plays a crucial protective role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury, and suggest that WEAA could serve as a lead medicinal herb for the development of neuroprotective agents following transient focal ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
