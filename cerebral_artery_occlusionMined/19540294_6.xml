<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of VEGF overexpression on development of cortical newborn neurons in the brains after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we injected human VEGF(165)-expressive plasmids (phVEGF) into the lateral ventricle of rat brains with a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An injection of phVEGF significantly promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (BrdU(+)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e>'s factor(+)) and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the rat brain after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single labeling of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and double staining of BrdU with lineage-specific neuronal markers were used to indicate the proliferated cells and maturation of newborn neurons in the brain section of rats at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that BrdU positive (BrdU(+)) cells existed in ipsilateral frontal cortex within 8 weeks after MCAO and reached the maximum at 2 weeks of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phVEGF treatment significantly increased BrdU(+) cells compared with the control plasmid (pEGFP) injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical neurogenesis was indicated by the presence of newborn immature (BrdU(+)-Tuj1(+)), newborn mature (BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+)), and newborn GABAergic (BrdU(+)-GAD67(+)) neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these neurons declined within 8 weeks after MCAO in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Injection of phVEGF significantly increased BrdU(+)-Tuj1(+) neurons at 2 weeks, and BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+) neurons and BrdU(+)-GAD67(+) neurons at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, phVEGF treatment significantly increased neurite length and branch numbers of BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+) newborn neurons compared with pEGFP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that VEGF enhances maturation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced cortical neurogenesis and dendritic formation of newborn neurons in adult mammalian brains </plain></SENT>
