<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced by a 2-hour occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and was followed by a 7-day observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM1 was intravenously administered 30 minutes after occlusion and daily during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the reduction in the electroencephalogram amplitude to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, three cats with mild, three cats with moderate, and three cats with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with 5 mg/kg GM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine cats, three in each group, were treated with 30 mg/kg GM1, while nine cats, three in each group, received middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats there was a precipitous fall in mean electroencephalogram amplitude during occlusion, followed by a secondary fall during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treated cats showed better recovery of electroencephalogram amplitude during the first 4 hours of reperfusion and a smaller secondary fall than untreated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treated cats, especially those treated with 5 mg/kg GM1, showed significant recovery of neurologic deficits compared with untreated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologic damage was less in treated cats than in untreated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some cats treated with 30 mg/kg GM1 exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, whereas no untreated cat showed any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> may improve the recovery of both neurologic deficits and morphologic damage in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These positive effects might be tentatively explained by stimulation of enzymatic activities such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+-ATPase and adenyl cyclase </plain></SENT>
