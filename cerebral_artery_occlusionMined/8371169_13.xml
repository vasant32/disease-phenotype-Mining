<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cyclooxygenase, an enzymatic step in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism, has effected an improvement in histologic outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no attempt to determine whether this effect occurs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> or during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the setting of either temporary or permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were allotted to one of the following groups: Groups I and II, 180 min of MCAo and 120 min of reperfusion; and Groups III and IV, 180 min of permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Groups I and III, vehicle only was given, whereas in Groups II and IV, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> was given throughout the study period (MCAo with or without reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the ischemic period the brains were analyzed for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (mm3, mean +/- S.D.) by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For animals in which reperfusion was allowed, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (Group I, 122 +/- 15 mm3 vs. Group II, 63 +/- 7 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in animals with permanent MCAo, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> worsened <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (Group III, 79 +/- 8 mm3 vs. Group IV, 110 +/- 13 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the beneficial effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition occurs during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
