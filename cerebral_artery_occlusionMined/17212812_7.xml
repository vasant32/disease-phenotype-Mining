<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, there is an upregulation of endothelin receptors in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to examine the effect of the PKC inhibitor Ro-32-0432 on endothelin receptor upregulation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurology outcome after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 24 hours after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the contractile endothelin B receptor mediated response and the endothelin B receptor protein expression were upregulated in the ipsilateral but not the contralateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Ro-32-0432 treated rats, the upregulated endothelin receptor response was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Ro-32-0432 treatment decreased the ischemic brain damage significantly and improved neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed fainter staining of endothelin B receptor protein in the smooth muscle cells of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of Ro-32-0432 treated rats compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that treatment with Ro-32-0432 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> decreases the ischemic infarction area, neurological symptoms and associated endothelin B receptor upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This provides a new perspective on possible mechanisms of actions of PKC inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
