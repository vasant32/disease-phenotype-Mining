<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">Hyperforin</z:chebi> is currently known to activate transient receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) channel, increase the phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), and has <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-antagonistic effect that convert potential neuroprotective effects in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">hyperforin</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in vivo remain controversial and its neuroprotective mechanisms are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">hyperforin</z:chebi> on transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">Hyperforin</z:chebi>, when applied immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and apoptotic cells, and also increased neurologic scores at 24â€‰hours after reperfusion accompanied by elevated TRPC6 and p-CREB activity and decreased SBDP145 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When MEK or CaMKIV activity was specifically inhibited, the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">hyperforin</z:chebi> was attenuated, and we observed a correlated decrease in CREB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results clearly showed that ICV injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5834">hyperforin</z:chebi> immediately after MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> blocked calpain-mediated TRPC6 channels degradation, and then to stimulate the Ras/MEK/ERK and CaMKIV pathways that converge on CREB activation, contributed to neuroprotection.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 14 November 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.164 </plain></SENT>
