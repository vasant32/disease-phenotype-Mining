<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that gabapentin can reduce neuronal injury in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but the mechanisms have not yet been clearly determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether gabapentin pretreatment altered expression levels of heat shock protein 70 and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase neuronal injury in rats subjected to transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (260-300 g) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (saline-treated, or 0.1, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg gabapentin group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals of the gabapentin groups were pretreated with a single intravenous administration of gabapentin 20 minutes before ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and motor behavior deficits were analyzed 24 hours after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3-reactive cells and cells showing Hsp70 activity were counted in the caudoputamen and fronto-parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infarction ratio was significantly decreased in the 5 mg/kg gabapentin group (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> ratios were significantly reduced in the 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg gabapentin groups 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were more Hsp70-reactive cells in the 5 mg/kg gabapentin group than in the saline group in both the caudoputamen and fronto-parietal cortex (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that gabapentin may have a neuroprotective effect and can reduce early neuronal injury caused by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion; this may be mediated by expression of Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, gabapentin pretreatment did not prevent caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
