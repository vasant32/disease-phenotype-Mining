<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have provided evidence to suggest exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> administration into autonomic nuclei prevents or reverses the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> observed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> seems to be a potent neuroprotectant against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, it is our hypothesis that endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels within autonomic nuclei will increase in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this investigation, in vivo microdialysis was used to simultaneously measure the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the plasma and in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of male Sprague-Dawley rats after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of dialysate samples before MCAO and in sham-operated controls revealed a baseline concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the PBN (38 +/- 3 pg/mL; n = 36), which was significantly greater than that found in plasma (22 +/- 6 pg/mL; n = 6; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the PBN was significantly increased immediately after MCAO (85 +/- 4 pg/mL; n = 7; P &lt; .05) but then decreased to below pre-MCAO values (12 +/- 2 pg/mL; n = 7; P &lt; .05) by 90 minutes after MCAO and remained below baseline levels until the end of the experiment (240 minutes post-MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No changes in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels were detected at any time point after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, extracellular electrophysiological recordings from PBN neurons revealed that MCAO resulted in an immediate decrease in the activity of PBN neurons, which was completely blocked after systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is released into the PBN in response to MCAO and that the source of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> seems to be primarily caused by terminal release as opposed to increased local synthesis </plain></SENT>
