<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induces a biphasic effect on the immune response that involves early activation of peripheral leukocytes followed by severe immunodepression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the spleen and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In tandem, the developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is exacerbated by influx of numerous inflammatory cell types, including T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prompted our use of recombinant T cell receptor ligands (RTL), partial major histocompatibility complex Class II molecules covalently bound to myelin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that RTL would improve ischemic outcome in the brain without exacerbating defects in the peripheral immune system function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four daily doses of RTL were administered subcutaneously to C57BL/6 mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and lesion size and cellular composition were assessed in the brain and cell numbers were assessed in the spleen and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with RTL551 (I-A(b) molecule linked to MOG-35-55 peptide) reduced cortical and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion size by approximately 50%, inhibited the accumulation of inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages/activated microglial cells and dendritic cells, and mitigated <z:mp ids='MP_0003643'>splenic atrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with RTL1000 (HLA-DR2 moiety linked to human MOG-35-55 peptide) similarly reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion size in HLA-DR2 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, control RTL with a nonneuroantigen <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> or a mismatched major histocompatibility complex Class II moiety had no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to demonstrate successful treatment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using a neuroantigen-specific immunomodulatory agent administered after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting therapeutic potential in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
