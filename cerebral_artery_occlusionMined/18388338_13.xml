<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although self-expanding intracranial microstents have been used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there are disadvantages associated with placing a permanent endovascular implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a technique in which a reconstrainable stent was used to provide a temporary endovascular bypass to achieve <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization without permanent stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 55-year-old male presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score (NIHSS) of 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed an occluded right cervical internal carotid artery (ICA), a patent anterior communicating artery (ACOMM), and embolic occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), M1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Working through a 6F guide-catheter positioned in the left cervical ICA, an SL-10 microcatheter, and 0.014-inch Synchro-2 microwire were manipulated across the anterior communicating artery and into the right M1 segment occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 mg of abciximab and 3 mg tPA were infused directly into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> through the microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombolysis using the microwire and microcatheter was ineffective in achieving any recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An Enterprise stent (4x22 mm) was delivered across the occlusion site and partially unconstrained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unconstrained portion of the stent expanded and acted as a temporary bypass, to circumferentially displace and structurally disrupt the M1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, producing immediate revascularization of the right territory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After approximately 20 minutes, the Enterprise stent was reconstrained and removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final angiography demonstrated excellent filling of the right M1 and distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient improved to an NIHSS of 7, regaining movement of his left upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The temporary endovascular bypass technique yielded immediate and durable revascularization of an acutely occluded middle cerebral artery without the disadvantages associated with the placement of a permanent endovascular stent </plain></SENT>
