<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and oxidized unsaturated free fatty acids have been postulated to aggravate neuronal damage in the postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type II PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH II) not only terminates signals by PAF by its PAF-hydrolyzing activity but also protects cells against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether PAF-AH II can rescue cerebral neurons against ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transgenic mice overexpressing human PAF-AH II in neurons were generated and enzyme expressions were examined biochemically and histochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice were subjected to 60 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were estimated by TTC staining and fluorescence TUNEL staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of PAF-AH II was found in brains of transgenic mice by Western blot and enzymatic activity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemistry, human PAF-AH II expression was found throughout the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, especially in neurons of neocortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit scores, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> index, and relative infarction volume were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower in transgenic mice (1.30+/-0.72, 1.12+/-0.04, and 14.0+/-7.7%, respectively) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (2.56+/-0.93, 1.23+/-0.12, and 31.9+/-9.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percentages of apoptotic cells were also significantly (P&lt;0.001) lower in transgenic mice (cortex, 5.2+/-3.3%; hippocampus, 3.4+/-7.0%) than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (cortex, 41.1+/-16.9%; hippocampus, 58.9+/-15.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PAF-AH II exerts strong neuroprotective effects against ischemic injury and suggest a possibility for clinical use of this enzyme in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
