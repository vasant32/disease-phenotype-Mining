<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent availability of transgenic animals has led to an interest in adapting the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> model in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date the model has not been well characterized in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed the present study to compare different durations of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and to validate new functional assessments in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model (5-0 filament) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Swiss-Webster mice, 24-44 g, were randomly assigned to four groups: one hour of occlusion; two hours of occlusion; three hours of occlusion; or permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals were rated on three neurologic function scales, and then the brains were removed for lesion size determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a significant difference in lesion volume (p &lt; 0.001) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the permanent group of mice, the average lesion volume was 78.41 +/- 17.47 mm (n = 12); two and three hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced 51.29 +/- 29.82 mm3 (n = 11) and 54.85 mm3 (n = 13), respectively, significantly different than the one hour group 14.84 +/- 31.34 mm3 (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three functional scoring systems found significant overall differences between the four groups with our detailed General and Focal scores producing more robust between group treatment differences and showing correlation coefficients of r = 0.766 and r = 0.788, respectively to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> filament occlusion model can be successfully adapted in the mouse with either two or three hour occlusions producing reliable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New functional scoring systems unique to the mouse appear to add additional information </plain></SENT>
