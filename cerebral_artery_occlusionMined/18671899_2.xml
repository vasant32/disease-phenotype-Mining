<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with electrocoagulation contralateral method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation (SO) group, MCAO group and EA treatment (ET) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Golgi dying, double immunofluorescence method and RT-PCR were used to detect dendritic spine density, expression patterns of ephrin-A5 and the effect of EA on them at the end of the first, second and fourth week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dendritic spine density in MCAO group significantly decreased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dendritic spine density was raised in ET group in the corresponding time period (p&lt;0.01) and among the ET groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was higher at the end of the fourth week than before (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The signal of ephrin-A5 was detected mainly in neuron cytoplasm, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in MCAO group and ET group increased compared to that in SO group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in ET group at the first week was much higher than that in MCAO group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ET groups, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of ephrin-A5 was down-regulated along with the time going (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is possibly the regulation of the ephrin-A5 expression by which EA treatment improves the neural plasticity at the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cerebral cortex in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There may be a time window in EA treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
