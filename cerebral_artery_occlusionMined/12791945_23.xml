<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> allows central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system antigens to leak into the systemic circulation and allows circulating leukocytes access to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Encounter of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system antigens by the peripheral immune system can be capitalized on to modulate the postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and potentially improve outcome from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Lewis rats were tolerized to myelin basic protein (MBP) or ovalbumin (OVA) and subjected to 3 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) or used as splenocyte donors for immunologically naive animals undergoing MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was determined at 24 hours by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate studies, mononuclear cells were removed from the brains of animals after MCAO for enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in animals tolerized to MBP and those receiving splenocytes from MBP-tolerized donors was less than in animals tolerized to OVA and those receiving splenocytes from OVA-tolerized donors (87.7+/-54.9 versus 148+/-61.6 mm3 [P=0.01] and 89.2+/-77.5 versus 153+/-77.1 mm3 [P=0.05], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the number of transforming growth factor-beta1-secreting mononuclear cells in MBP-tolerized animals undergoing sham surgery (P=0.001) as well as in ischemic animals 48 hours (P=0.02) and 336 hours (P=0.04) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A distinct subset of gammadelta T cells was present in the brains of MBP-tolerized but not control animals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunologic tolerance and its neuroprotective effects can be transferred to naive animals and appear to be related to antigen-specific induction of transforming growth factor-beta1 </plain></SENT>
