<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and DNA damage-inducible protein, GADD34 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) have been investigated in the core and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone at 2 and 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At these times after MCAO, numerous GADD34-positive cells were present, particularly in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone (e.g. 24 +/- 4 and 52 +/- 6 immunopositive cells/0.25 mm2 at 2 and 24 h, respectively, in cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCNA-immunopositive cells were barely detectable in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone at 2 h; however, numerous PCNA-immunopositive cells were present in this zone by 24 h (0.7 +/- 0.3 and 10.6 +/- 1.5 immunopositive cells/0.25 mm2, respectively) as well as in the adjacent cortex and in the contralateral cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most GADD34-immunopositive cells coexpressed the neuronal marker Neu-N with a smaller number coexpressing the microglial marker, Mrf-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence of morphologically 'abnormal' and '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' GADD34 immunopositive neurons was found within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of PCNA immunopositive cells were Mrf-1 positive with a smaller number Neu-N positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double-labelling revealed colocalization of GADD34 and PCNA in some cells within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone and in the ependymal cells lining the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of GADD34 and PCNA in a key anatomical location pertinent to the evolving ischaemic lesion indicates that GADD34, either alone or in combination with PCNA, has the potential to influence cell survival in ischaemically compromised tissue </plain></SENT>
