<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is mounting evidence indicating an important role for complement in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the alternative complement pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has not been investigated, and there is conflicting data on the role of the terminal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, mice deficient in the alternative pathway protein factor B or mice treated with the alternative pathway inhibitor CR2-fH have improved outcomes after 60-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor B-deficient or CR2-fH-treated mice were protected in terms of improved neurologic function and reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, P-selectin expression, neutrophil infiltration, and microthrombi formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient in both the classical and lectin pathways (C1q/MBL deficient) were also protected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury, and there was no detectable C3d deposition in the ipsilateral brain of these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the alternative pathway is not alone sufficient to initiate complement activation and indicate that the alternative pathway propagates cerebral injury via amplification of the cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of C6, a component of the terminal cytolytic membrane attack complex, had no effect on outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, indicating that the membrane attack complex is not involved in mediating injury in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We additionally show that the protective effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor B deficiency</z:e> and CR2-fH treatment is sustained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development, adding to the clinical relevance of these findings </plain></SENT>
