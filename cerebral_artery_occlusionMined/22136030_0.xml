<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 25 SD rats were randomly divided into a sham-operation group, a model group, an EA. group, a TFP group and an EA+TFP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established by the modified Longa thread occlusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EA group was treated with EA at "Dazhui" (GV 14) and "Baihui" (GV 20) for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TFP group was treated with lumbar intrathecal injection of Trinuoperazine (TFP) at a dose of 40 microL/kg, the inhibitor of CaM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EA + TFP group was treated with EA combined with TFP, and the sham-operation group and the model group without any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurology deficit score was evaluated by the Julio's neuroethology score methods in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, and the expression of CaM in cerebral hippocampus tissue was detected with immunohistochemical method in different intervention condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In comparison with the model group of 6.90 +/- 1.66, the neuroethology score in the EA group of 14.50 +/- 1.08, the TFP group of 11.70 +/- 1.06 and the EA + TFP group of 14.30 +/- 1.06 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly increased (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), while those still were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lower than the sham group of 17.60 +/- 0.52 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), and the EA group was better than the TFP group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) In comparison with the sham group of 0.080 +/- 0.045, the immune positive expression score of CaM protein in hippocampus in the model group of 1.680 +/- 0.268 was sig nificantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the model group, the expression score of CaM protein in the EA group of 0.880 +/- 0.179, the TFP group of 0.720 +/- 0.179 and the EA + TFP group of 0.420 +/- 0.249 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly reduced (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), and the expression score of CaM in the EA + TFP group was lower than that in the TFP group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA can reduce the injury of cerebral neurons induced by CIRI in rats and promote the recovery, which may be related to its effect in regulating CaM signaling pathway after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
