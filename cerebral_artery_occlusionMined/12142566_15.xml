<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors explored the temporal profiles of the expression levels and subcellular localization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only proteins in permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They observed an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> distribution of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> at 3 to 6 hours of MCAO that appeared unrelated to transcriptional upregulation, as assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 to 6 hours of MCAO, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> immunoreactivity was enhanced in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> localization of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> coincided with a marked <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and preceded the peak of caspase-9 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors observed an association of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> with the dynein intermediate chain, a major component of the dynein motor complex, in the brain using a coimmunoprecipitation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced a time-dependent significant decrease in dynein expression, which started at 3 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors deduced that the liberation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> from the dynein motor complex is a likely mechanism for the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> localization of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During MCAO, Bad did not show any change in phosphorylation state or subcellular localization </plain></SENT>
