<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been shown to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats when administered intracerebroventricularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this invasive method of administration is not practical for the large number of individuals who require treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intranasal (IN) delivery offers a noninvasive method of bypassing the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) to deliver IGF-I and other neurotrophic factors to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate for the first time the therapeutic benefit of IN IGF-1 in rats following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A blinded, vehicle-controlled study of IN IGF-I was performed using the intraluminal suture occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly divided into vehicle-control, 37.5 and 150 microg IGF-I-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatments occurred at 10 min after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 2 h of MCAO, and then 24 and 48 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four neurologic behavioral tests were performed 4, 24, 48 and 72 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated 72 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with the 150 microg IGF-I significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 63% vs. control (p=0.004), and improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the neurologic deficit tests of motor, sensory, reflex and vestibulomotor functions (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the 37.5 microg dose of IGF-I was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While IGF-I does not cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> efficiently, it can be delivered to the brain directly from the nasal cavity following IN administration, bypassing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IN IGF-I markedly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurologic function following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This noninvasive, simple and cost-effective method is a potential treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
