<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also identified increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi>) binding sites as a potential marker for neutrophil infiltration into focal ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these studies were conducted at only one time-point, 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the full time-course of MPO activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> receptor binding following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) made permanently (PMCAO) or transiently (160 min followed by reperfusion; TMCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and compared the results to previously characterized histologic changes in these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic and contralateral (control) cortical tissue samples were assayed for MPO (U/g wet wt) and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> receptor binding (fmol/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following PMCAO, MPO activity significantly increased as early as 12 h and continued to increase over the next 5 d (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following TMCAO, MPO activity was significantly elevated already after only 6 h of reperfusion and also continued to increase over the next 5 d of reperfusion (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> receptor binding and MPO activity were highly correlated during periods when both measures increased together (i.e., 0.5-5 d; p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, by 15 d post-MCAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> receptor binding remained elevated after MPO activity levels had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> binding was associated with the significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> that was characterized previously to persist in these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time-course of increased MPO activity and initially increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> binding post-MCAO correspond very well to our previous histological data that characterized the time-course for <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the increased MPO activity over time was associated with initial neutrophil and later mononuclear cell infiltration into ischemic tissue in these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the present studies utilized histochemical analysis to demonstrate peroxidase activity in macrophages within the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> following MCAO, thus validating that MPO activity originates from the later infiltrating mononuclear cells in addition to the early infiltrating neutrophils that had been previously characterized in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TMCAO produces a significantly larger and earlier increase in ischemic cortex MPO activity and a similar later increase in MPO activity compared to PMCAO treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
