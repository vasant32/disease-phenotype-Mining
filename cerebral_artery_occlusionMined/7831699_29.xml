<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, only anecdotal experience with supratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> treated by decompressive craniectomy has been reported; and there are no published experimental data dealing with this kind of therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present our results on the effect of decompressive craniectomy in an endovascular model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in 50 rats using an endovascular occlusion technique of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decompressive craniectomy was performed in 30 animals: in 15 animals after 1 hour and in the remaining 15 animals 24 hours after vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty animals were not treated by decompressive craniectomy (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality in the nontreated group was 35%, whereas none of the animals treated by decompressive craniectomy died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and infarction size were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly better in the animals treated by decompressive craniectomy, regardless of whether they had been treated after 1 or 24 hours (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that decompressive craniectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> not only reduces mortality but also significantly improves outcome and reduces infarction size, probably because of increased perfusion pressure through leptomeningeal collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This experimental study suggests that a controlled study of decompressive craniectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> would be worthwhile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By performing decompressive craniectomy in a small, selected group of patients, neurosurgeons may play an important role in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
