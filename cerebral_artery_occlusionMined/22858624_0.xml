<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus our goal was to examine whether modest ExT could influence transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury along with nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS)-dependent dilation of cerebral (pial) arterioles during T1D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: nondiabetic sedentary, nondiabetic ExT, diabetic (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>; 50 mg/kg ip) sedentary, and diabetic ExT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first series of studies, we measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of rats following right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second series of studies, a craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex, and we measured responses of pial arterioles to an endothelial NOS (eNOS)-dependent, a neuronal NOS (nNOS)-dependent, and a NOS-independent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that sedentary diabetic rats had significantly larger total, cortical, and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion than sedentary nondiabetic, nondiabetic ExT, and diabetic ExT rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were similar in sedentary nondiabetic, ExT nondiabetic, and ExT diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ExT did not alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in nondiabetic compared with sedentary nondiabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, ExT diabetic rats had impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent, but not NOS-independent, vasodilation that was restored by ExT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus ExT of T1D rats lessened ischemic brain injury following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and restored impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is increased during T1D, we suggest that our finding are significant in that modest ExT may be a viable preventative therapeutic approach to lessen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury that may occur in T1D subjects </plain></SENT>
