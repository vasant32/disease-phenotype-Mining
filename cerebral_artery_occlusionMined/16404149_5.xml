<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the possible protective role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> we examined their expression in the cerebral cortex damaged by ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, and the resulting damage was observed by staining with 2, 3, 5-triphenylterazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> GM3 and GM1 increased in the damaged cerebral cortex, and immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed a significant change in expression of GM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in situ hybridization demonstrated an increase in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> GM3 synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> GM1 and GM3 may be synthesized in vivo to protect the cerebral cortex from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
