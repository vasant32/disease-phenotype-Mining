<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is gaining use as a tool to assess cerebral recovery following various insults, the effects of potential confounders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during an fMRI study could produce a detected activation unrelated to neuronal activity within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> induced increases in blood pressure (BP) on the fMRI response to forepaw stimulation were investigated in controls or 1 week after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were smoothed spatially and voxels correlating to either forepaw stimulation or the change in BP time courses were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased the signal intensity and numbers of voxels correlating to the BP time courses within and adjacent to the ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and these exceeded the response in the contralateral hemisphere or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With left paw stimulation at normotension, there was a loss of activation in right sensory-motor cortex -- a region with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and disruption of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As BP increased left paw stimulation also resulted in the detection of activation in the infarcted sensory-motor cortex and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, BP changes synchronous with tasks in fMRI studies can result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes consistent with a loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation rather than neuronal activation in necrotic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the use of stressful tasks associated with BP changes in fMRI studies should be limited or the BP change should be considered as a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal changes </plain></SENT>
