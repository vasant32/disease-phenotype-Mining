<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to elucidate how NHE1-induced Ca(2+) signaling during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> is transformed into cellular responses in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pericytes were cultured, and the activation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) was evaluated by Western blotting analysis, immunofluorescence, and luciferase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pericytes, low extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> or low pH generated Ca(2+) oscillation and subsequently phosphorylated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and CREB in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was applied using photothrombotic distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice, and the phosphorylation of CREB and the production of interleukin-6 were observed in pericytes migrating into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra during the early phase after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that extracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> induces Ca(2+) oscillation via NHE1, leading to Ca(2+)/CaMKII-dependent CREB activation in human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>Acidosis</z:hpo> may upregulate a variety of proteins, such as interleukin-6, through the NHE1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/CaMKII-CREB pathway in brain pericytes and may thus modulate brain ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
