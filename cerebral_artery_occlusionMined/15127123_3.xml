<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed after MCAO surviving time 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As determined by Western blot, the expressions of TRPC4 in striatum and hippocampus of 12 h, 1 d, 3 d groups were significant higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that the TRPC4 immunoreactive substances were present in the membrane of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, immunostaining positive cells increased in hippocampus and striatum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TRPC4 immunostaining positive cells increased significantly in 1d-group and 3d-group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It suggests that as a Ca(2+) selective channel, the variance of the expression of TRPC4 may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed neuronal injury in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
