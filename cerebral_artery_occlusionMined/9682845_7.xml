<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used an ultrasensitive, highly specific immunometric assay for rat IL-1beta to determine the pattern of protein expression in the rat cerebral cortex following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex there was a biphasic pattern of production with a rapid early phase of IL-1beta expression followed by a delayed phase at 4 h which was sustained for up to 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a similar but smaller expression of IL-1beta in the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham operated animals showed no IL-1beta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence to show that IL-1beta is expressed in the rat cerebral cortex following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
