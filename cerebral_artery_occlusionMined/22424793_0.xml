<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reports suggested that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could protect brain against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the limited number of BMSCs in the brain hampered their application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore a way that might improve the migration and differentiation of BMSCs in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the additive therapeutic effect of combination <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29749">Ferulate</z:chebi> (SF) and BMSCs treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, BMSCs were primarily cultured from rat bone marrow and were identified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) was induced and the ischemic brain was observed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological functional outcome was respectively evaluated at 0 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours post-operation, and the stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) /chemokine(CXC motif)receptor-4(CXCR4) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions at the marginal zone of the ischemic brain were respectively measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western Blot at 3days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; furthermore, Nestin and BrdU double immunostaining was performed for identification of BMSC differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> significantly improved the neurological functional recovery as early as 48 hours and up-regulated the SDF-1α /CXCR4 axis, enhanced BMSC migration into the ischemic brain and differentiation into Nestin-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that SF combined with BMSC administration can ameliorate rat brain ischemic injury and has beneficial effect on the rat neurological functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
