<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of three housekeeping genes have been analysed in this model to determine which gene showed least change following experimental insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the lesioned cortex, beta-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased at 24 h, while the levels of cyclophilin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also used this methodology to examine modulations in the level of caspase-3 mRNA during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 mRNA showed a 41% increase at 6 h post-MCAO, which was specific to the lesioned cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This change became more pronounced with time, showing an increase of 220% at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This methodology enables changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression to be analysed more sensitively and quantitatively than other available techniques and highlights the need for careful choice of control or housekeeping genes used for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> comparisons </plain></SENT>
