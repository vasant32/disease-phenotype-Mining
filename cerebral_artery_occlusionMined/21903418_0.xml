<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the predictive factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 1 week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated 643 patients who were admitted within 2 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between April 2007 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>Neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> was defined as an increase of 4 points or more in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score within 1 week of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrieved data on demographic and clinical characteristics, medications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 537 patients, deterioration was noted in 64 patients (11.9%; deterioration group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001), NIHSS score ≥8 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001), high leukocyte count (P = .035), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> ≥140 mg/dL (P = .002), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c ≥7% (P = .006) as significant factors associated with deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Branch atheromatous disease was more frequent in the deterioration group, and &gt;90% of patients with deterioration either were discharged to nursing home care or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of magnetic resonance imaging findings identified internal carotid/middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (each P &lt; .001), striate capsular infarction (P = .030), pontine infarction (P = .047), and lesion size of 15-30 mm (P = .011) as independent factors associated with deterioration </plain></SENT>
