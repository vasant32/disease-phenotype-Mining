<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused a major loss of projection neurons, identified by their immunoreactivity to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 3':5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32,000, in the lateral part of the striatum, as observed at 48 h following the insult with no further change at one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no reduction of the number of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase-positive, cholinergic interneurons, which also expressed TrkA, was detected at either time-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48 h following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor was observed in striatal cells which, by the use of double-label immunostaining, were identified as the cholinergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No p75 neurotrophin receptor immunoreactivity remained in cholinergic cells after one week of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on current hypotheses regarding the function of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, the transient expression of this receptor in striatal cholinergic interneurons might contribute to their high resistance to ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor could also be a first step in a pathway leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which is inhibited after the present insult due to concomitant activation of TrkA </plain></SENT>
