<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the wide substrate specificity of ABAD and its high activity on l-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives, we asked whether it might also catalyze the oxidation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> body d-3-hydroxybutyrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was indeed the case, and oxidation proceeded with K(m) of approximately 4.5 mm and V(max) of approximately 4 nmol/min/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When placed in medium with d-beta-hydroxybutyrate as the principal energy substrate, COS cells stably transfected to overexpress <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ABAD (COS/wtABAD) better maintained 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> reduction, cellular energy charge, and morphologic phenotype compared with COS/vector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a severe model of metabolic perturbation, transgenic mice with targeted neuronal expression of ABAD subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of smaller volume and lower neurologic deficit scores in parallel with increased brain ATP and decreased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, compared with nontransgenic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ABAD contributes to the protective response to metabolic stress, especially in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
