<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether electroacupuncture can reduce behavior deficit and long-term potentiation (LTP) in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we used a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) technique to induce a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> model with additional electroacupuncture (EA) manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behaviors were impaired in animals with MCAo, and similar results were observed with long-term potentiation induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAo decreased the expression of LTP from 180.4±14.9% to 112.5±18.3%, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could impair the hippocampal LTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunostaining results showed that the expressions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor subtype 1 (NR1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) receptors were significantly increased in the hippocampal CA1 areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noticeably, these phenomena can be reversed by 2 Hz EA at Baihui acupoint (GV20) for six consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results support a rescue role of 2 Hz EA for MCAo-induced behavior and LTP impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest that NMDAR1 and TRPV1 may be involved in this pathway </plain></SENT>
