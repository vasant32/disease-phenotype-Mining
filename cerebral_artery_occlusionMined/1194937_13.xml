<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> method with selective application of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> bolus through the internal carotid and the newly established superficial temporal channel has allowed comparison of the flow provided by the pathological input with flow through the new input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that initial rCBF (rCBF1) was globally reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to a mean of 28.4 +/- 11.9 ml/100 gm/min at a mean pCO2 of 29.6 +/- 9.55 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with minimal residua (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>) had a mean rCBF1 of 30.4 +/- 11.6 ml/100 gm/min at a mean pCO2 of 30 +/- 10 mm Hg, while patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had a mean rCBF1 of 25.0 +/- 12.4 ml/100 gm/min at a mean pCO2 of 29.1 +/- 8.8 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that in this small group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>'s, the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is probably related more to decreased perfusion than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, and may explain why these patients' symptoms improve after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that in addition to an inaccessible lesion, global or focal decreased rCBF is a necessary criterion in the definition of indications for intracranial revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
