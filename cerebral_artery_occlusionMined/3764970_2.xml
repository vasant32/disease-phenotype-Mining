<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals infused with Fluosol and one-half the animals infused with saline were ventilated with 100% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue oxygen availability and regional cerebral blood flow were measured by <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> electrodes using direct voltage recordings for oxygen measurements and hydrogen clearance curves for measurements of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With 100% oxygenation tissue oxygen availability increased significantly in the Fluosol treated animals, however, during the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> oxygen availability decreased below baseline values to about an equal level whether the animals were treated with Fluosol or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow fell to a similar value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups during the time of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour after reperfusion blood flow increased considerably above baseline values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and oxygen availability also increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups but particularly in the Fluosol treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality and the size of infarction 1 week after the ischemic insult were not significantly different in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality was directly related to the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> which, in turn, was related to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during the time of occlusion </plain></SENT>
