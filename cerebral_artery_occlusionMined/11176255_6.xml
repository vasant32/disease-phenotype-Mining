<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Because contrast agent (CA) formulations are injected intravenously to patients who may have a disrupted blood-brain barrier, their neurotolerability should be tested by using appropriate animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a model of rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> evaluated in terms of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was validated and then used to compare the neurotolerability of gadobenate dimeglumine to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi>, a well-documented CA for brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were prepared for EEG recording about 15 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced in the right hemisphere by 2-hour middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion and 3-day reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model validation in terms of EEG, on day 3 after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, was performed by using iopromide, a poorly neurotolerated iodinated CA in rats, intravenously injected at 7 g <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEG recording was analyzed for pathological tracings and for changes in spectral content in terms of the frequency index (FI) at 1, 2, and 3 hours after test compound injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparative study between gadobenate dimeglumine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi> was performed at 2.0 mmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16899">D-Mannitol</z:chebi> was used as a control compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of CA in the rat brain was verified by measuring the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> content by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the absence of metabolism for both CAs, the values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> content can be interpreted as representing unmetabolized CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On days 1, 2, and 3 after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the lesioned hemisphere of rats presented a decreased FI value with respect to the basal value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The unlesioned hemisphere, after a slight, nonsignificant decrease in the FI value on the first 2 days, presented a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FI value on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, ischemic rats on day 3 after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were chosen for these neurotolerability studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Iopromide injected intravenously into ischemic rats at a dose 10 times higher than the maximum clinical dose caused bilateral spikes on the EEG and increases in FI values for the unlesioned hemisphere without affecting the lesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gadobenate dimeglumine, like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi> when injected into ischemic rats, did not cause spikes or further changes in the FI value of the lesioned hemisphere and did not modify the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FI value of the unlesioned hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant differences between gadobenate dimeglumine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16899">D-mannitol</z:chebi> were found when postinjection FI values were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> were found in the lesioned hemisphere with respect to the unlesioned hemisphere after both gadobenate dimeglumine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We can therefore conclude that (1) on the EEG, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion is an appropriate model for evaluating CA neurotolerability because ischemic and CA effects can be clearly differentiated; (2) the higher level of CA in the lesioned hemisphere compared with the unlesioned one (two to three times), even 3 hours after injection, demonstrates that the CA effectively penetrated the brain; if it were neurotoxic, any negative effects would have been detected; and (3) gadobenate dimeglumine, like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi>, injected intravenously at a dose 20 times higher than the intended clinical dose for brain MRI is well tolerated and, also like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37333">gadodiamide</z:chebi>, is suitable for use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> for which contrast-enhanced MRI is indicated </plain></SENT>
