<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: controls, model, 2 Hz Shuigou, 50 Hz Shuigou and 100 Hz Shuigou </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 10 rats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a modification of a technique for middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, focal cerebral ischemic injury was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats except those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats in the control group received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After behavioral deficit had been evaluated using the Zausinger 6-point neurological function score, the rats in the Shuigou groups underwent acupuncture and continuous wave stimulation at a frequency of 2 Hz, 50 Hz or 100 Hz (intensity 1 mA) for 10 min twice daily for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control and model groups underwent no intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Zausinger 6-point neurological function score and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi> were measured 72 h after the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological function scores of the three Shuigou groups were significantly higher than those of the model group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between sides in the latency and amplitude of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi> in the model group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latency on the affected side in the model group was significantly longer than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) and the amplitude on affected side was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of electro-acupuncture, the latency on the affected side in the 2 Hz Shuigou group was significantly shortened (P &lt; 0.05) and the amplitude was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low frequency electro-acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26) can promote recovery of motor function after focal cerebral ischemic injury in rats </plain></SENT>
