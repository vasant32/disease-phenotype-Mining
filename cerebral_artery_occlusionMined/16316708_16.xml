<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, scientific evidence related to their effectiveness or precise modes of neuroprotective action is largely unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we elicited the neuroprotective mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> after focal cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) by common carotid arteries and middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> was administrated 60 min before occlusion via intraperitoneal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> concentration-dependently exhibited significant neuroprotective effect against ischemic deficits by reduction of behavioral disturbance </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral I/R-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release were reduced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the up-regulation of Bax and Bad by cerebral I/R insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among them, only the alteration in Bcl-xL expression was reversed by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the activation of microglia and/or recruitment of inflammatory cells within the ischemic side and the consequent production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) were suppressed by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> pre-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> might provide neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury, in part, through suppression of inflammatory reaction, reduction of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
