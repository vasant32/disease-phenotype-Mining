<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was induced through permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in 5 healthy Beagle dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-turbo spin echo images and TOF-MRA were obtained with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance system before and 3 and 10 d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 dogs, angiograms of the brain obtained at 3 d after MCAO showed complete occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>; in addition, T2 hyperintensities were present unilaterally in the striatocapsular and cerebral cortex lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial occlusion of the proximal part of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was identified in the 2 remaining dogs, with T2 hyperintensities present only in the striatocapsular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occluded sites were confirmed at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate the potential of TOF-MRA to provide a detailed description of intracranial arteries and aid in the evaluation of flow impairment in a canine MCAO model </plain></SENT>
