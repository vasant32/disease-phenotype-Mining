<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four SD rats were randomly divided into four groups, i. e., the sham-operation group, the model group, the DMSO group, and the CCPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MCAO model was established by thread embolism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the moment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, the rats in DMSO group and the CCPA group were injected with DMSO (20 microL) and CCPA (0.1 mmol) 20 microL into Baihui respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats' behavior, the histomorphology of ischemic penumbra in the cerebral cortex, the expressions of Bcl-2 protein, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of neurocytes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group and the DMSO group, the rats' behavior were markedly improved in the CCPA group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No obvious karyopyknosis and cytoplasm empty dye of neurons appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2 expressions in rats' cerebral cortex obviously increased (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> number of neurons obviously decreased (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Injecting CCPA into Bahui improved the rats' behavior and histomorphology in the ischemic penumbra, elevated the expressions of Bcl-2 protein, and reduced the neurons <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It alleviated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it could be taken as a new treatment method </plain></SENT>
