<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The behavioural effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>-E deficient (Apo-E KO) mice were investigated using a modified SHIRPA protocol and compared with effects in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was permanently occluded by insertion of an intraluminal filament to its origin on the Circle of Willis and behavioural responses were observed 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO treatment caused a range of changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice whereas, few differences were observed in the Apo-E KO mice in the behavioural observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the rotarod task, MCAO operated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice showed a significant reduction in performance compared with sham-operated and non-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both sham and MCAO operated Apo-E KO mice showed significant impairment compared with non-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in performance was also observed in sham-operated Apo-E KO compared with sham-operated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In locomotor activity tests, no significant reduction in activity was observed between non-operated and sham-operated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> controls, whereas a significant reduction was found between sham operated and MCAO operated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Apo-E KO mice, both sham and MCAO-operated animals showed a reduction in locomotor activity compared with non-operated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Apo-E KO MCAO mice showed a worsened deficit in locomotor activity, which was significantly correlated with exacerbated cortical lesion volume, unlike <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MCAO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows that Apo-E KO animals demonstrate an impaired functional recovery post surgery which may be further compounded by post experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and also demonstrates the utility of the SHIRPA test system for investigating behavioural changes in functional outcome post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
