<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is great interest in developing novel <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or thrombolytic strategies to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, at present there are limited means to accurately assess the hemorrhagic potential of these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies were designed to develop and validate a method to accurately quantify the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) in murine models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a murine model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was induced by stereotaxic intraparenchymal infusion of collagenase B alone (6 x 10(-6) U; n = 5) or collagenase B followed by intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (0.1 mg/kg; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls consisted of either sham surgery with stereotaxic infusion of saline (n = 5) or untreated animals (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was (1) graded by a scale based on maximal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> diameter on coronal sections and (2) quantified by a spectrophotometric assay measuring cyanomethemoglobin in chemically reduced extracts of homogenized murine brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This spectrophotometric assay was validated with the use of known quantities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or autologous blood added to a separate cohort of homogenized brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this assay, the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after focal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion was quantified in mice treated with postocclusion high-dose intravenous rt-PA (10 mg/kg; n = 11) and control mice subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but treated with physiological saline solution (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Known quantities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or autologous blood added to fresh whole brain tissue homogenates showed a linear relationship between the amount added and optical density (OD) at the absorbance peak of cyanomethemoglobin (r = 1.00 and .98, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When in vivo studies were performed to quantify experimentally induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, animals receiving intracerebral infusion of collagenase B had significantly higher ODs than saline-infused controls (2.1-fold, increase; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, administration of rt-PA after reperfusion increased the OD by 1.8-fold compared with animals that received physiological saline solution (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the two methods of measuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (visual score and OD) were compared, there was a linear correlation (r = .88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments demonstrated that triphenyltetrazolium staining, which is commonly used to stain viable brain tissue, does not interfere with the spectrophotometric quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the spectrophotometric assay accurately and reliably quantifies murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This new method should aid objective assessment of the hemorrhagic risks of novel <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or thrombolytic strategies to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and can facilitate quantification of other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
