<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared to similarly positioned vessels on the opposite hemisphere and arterioles in unoperated rats of 56 days of age, there were significantly (P less than 0.001) more large (60-120 microM) diameter collaterals on the occluded side 20 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were fewer small (0-59 microm) diameter collaterals on the occluded side as compared to unoperated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest small diameter arterioles existing at occlusion became large diameter collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean number of collaterals per hemisphere was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) between occluded and unoperated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that new vessels were added during the 20-day ligation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean collateral tortuosity value was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater for large diameter vessels on the right occluded side as compared to vessels on the left hemisphere or vessels in unoperated age-matched control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greater tortuosity values of vessels on the occluded side were evidence that collateral vessel length was increased by 24-29% after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Speculation was made about possible mechanisms responsible for these vascular changes </plain></SENT>
