<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and HSP10 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> chaperonin proteins and are responsible for the folding of newly imported proteins and 13 polypeptides encoded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expressions of HSP60 and HSP10 are regulated simultaneously because these genes are localized head to head on chromosome, separated by a bidirectional promoter, which harbors heat shock element (HSE), CHOP, STAT3, and SP1 binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that the expressions of HSP60 and HSP10 in the brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) are induced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expressions of HSP60 and HSP10 were further upregulated by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (AG), an inhibitor of the inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), which is known to reduce ischemic damage in an animal model after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in the present study suggest that HSP10 and HSP60 are induced in the postischemic brain, yet are downregulated by NO generated from 12 hr after MCAO/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of HSP60 and HSP10 by NO were confirmed in vitro, wherein HSP10 and SHP60 expressions were increased by treatment of LPS and IFN gamma (LPS/INF gamma) in C6 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">astroglioma</z:e> cells and further upregulated by NMMA, another iNOS inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene analysis combined with deletion and mutation studies showed that STAT3 binding site in the bidirectional promoter is responsible for LPS/INF gamma-induced upregulation and for downregulation by NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that NO suppresses HSP60 and HSP10 inductions in the postischemic brain by suppressing STAT3 binding to its recognition site </plain></SENT>
