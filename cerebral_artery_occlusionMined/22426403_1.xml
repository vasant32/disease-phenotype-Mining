<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation examined the hypothesis that hypoxic preconditioning of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could not only enhance their survival but also reinforce regenerative properties of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMSCs from eGFP engineered rats or pre-labeled with BrdU were pre-treated with normoxia (20% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, N-BMSCs) or sub-lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (0.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>H-BMSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> exposure up-regulated HIF-1Î± and trophic/growth factors in BMSCs, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor FIK-1, erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor EPOR, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, many pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were down-regulated in H-BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N-BMSCs or H-BMSCs were intravenously injected into adult rats 24h after 90-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing to N-BMSCs, transplantation of H-BMSCs showed greater effect of suppressing microglia activity in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly more NeuN-positive and Glut1-positive cells were seen in the ischemic core and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions of the animals received H-BMSC transplantation than that received N-BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some NeuN-positive and Glut-1-positive cells showed eGFP or BrdU immunoflourescent reactivity, suggesting differentiation from exogenous BMSCs into neuronal and vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Rotarod test performed 15days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, animals received H-BMSCs showed better locomotion recovery compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control and N-BMSC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that hypoxic preconditioning of transplanted cells is an effective means of promoting their regenerative capability and therapeutic potential for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
