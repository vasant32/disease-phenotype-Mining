<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the following blood-pressure regimens was maintained during either a 30- or 120-min period of reperfusion: (a) 30/Norm, 30 min of normotensive reperfusion was allowed; (b) 30/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>, mean arterial blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during 30 min of reperfusion; (c) 120/Norm, 120 min of normotensive reperfusion was allowed; or (d) 120/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>, mean arterial blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during 120 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evans blue (30 mg/kg) was given, and brains were analyzed for Evans blue by spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evans blue (microgram/g brain tissue, mean +/- SD) was greater (P less than 0.05) in both hypertensive groups versus their time matched normotensive groups (30/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>: 80 +/- 16 versus 18 +/- 6 in the 30/Norm group; 120/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>: 17 +/- 6 versus 8 +/- 3 in the 120/Norm group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Evans blue was greater (P less than 0.05) in both 30-min groups versus their pressure matched 120-min groups (30/Norm: 18 +/- 6 versus 8 +/- 3 in the 120/Norm group; 30/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>: 80 +/- 16 versus 17 +/- 6 in the 120/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with previous studies which have demonstrated an opening of the blood-brain barrier at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the data support a hypothesis that changes in blood-brain barrier permeability are more sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the early period of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
