<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of EA against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> whether influence IGF-1 expression following the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that after occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, the IGF-1mRNA and protein expression was down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA, given 15 minutes after occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and lasted for 1 h between the acupuncture points Baihui Point (GV </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>26) with a dense-sparse waveforms, which can be transformed into each other when dense or sparse wave is terminated, attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, up-regulated IGF-1mRNA and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results implied that EA is effective to extenuate cerebral ischemic injuries and up-regulating the endogenous IGF-1 expression following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in monkeys, which might be an important mechanism of neuroprotective effects of EA against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
