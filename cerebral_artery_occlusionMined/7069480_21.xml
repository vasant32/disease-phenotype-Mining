<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A standardized regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> was used, and the times of initiation of administration were varied following a 6-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of five animals were treated at 30, 120, and 240 minutes after occlusion, while one group of five animals received no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete protection from intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and ischemic damage was seen only in the group treated at 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those treated at 120 minutes, while doing better than untreated animals, still had ICP elevation and a marked neuropathological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals treated at 240 minutes suffered a detrimental effect, in that malignant ICP and marked ischemic damage occurred earlier than in the untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The safe "therapeutic window" for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> in this animal model does not extend beyond 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed administration results in a deleterious response and not merely a lack of protection </plain></SENT>
