<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose a noninvasive and easy-to-use optical imaging technique for measuring CBF in experimental small animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) via tail-vein catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time-series near-infrared fluorescence signals excited by 760 nm light-emitting diodes were imaged overhead by a charge-coupled device coupled with an 830 nm bandpass-filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated four CBF parameters including arrival time, rising time and mean transit time of a bolus and blood flow index based on time and intensity information of ICG fluorescence dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF maps were generated using the parameters to estimate the status of CBF, and they dominantly represented intracerebral blood flows in mice even in the presence of an intact skull and scalp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that this noninvasive optical imaging technique successfully detected reduced local CBF during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further showed that the proposed method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the differences between CBF status in mice anesthetized with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> or ketamine-xylazine, and monitor the dynamic changes in CBF after reperfusion during transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The near-infrared optical imaging of ICG fluorescence combined with a time-series analysis of the molecular dynamics can be a useful noninvasive tool for preclinical studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
