<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the proteins that are differentially expressed following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment during ischemic brain injury using a proteomics technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed to induce a focal cerebral ischemic injury in adult male rats, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered immediately after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissues were collected 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proteins in the cerebral cortex were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected differentially expressed proteins between vehicle- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adenosylhomocysteinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15846">NAD(+)</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase were decreased in the vehicle-treated group, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced decreases in these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal phosphate</z:chebi> phosphatase and heat shock protein 60 were increased in the vehicle-treated group, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced increase in these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is accepted that these enzymes are involved in cellular metabolism and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings suggest evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> plays a neuroprotective role against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> through the up- and down-modulation of specific enzymes </plain></SENT>
