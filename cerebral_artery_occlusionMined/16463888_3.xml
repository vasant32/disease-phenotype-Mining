<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fetal NSCs were cultured from E14 days SD rats and transfected with VEGF121 gene by using lipofectamine technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) models were established and randomly divided into 1: control group, 2: PBS transplantation group, 3: NSCs transplantation group and 4: VEGF-secreting NSCs transplantation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grafts were transplanted into the penumbra zones 3 days after tMCAO model established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was checked in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups 2-12 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using immunofluorescent staining, VEGF expression of transplanted cells, differentiation and migration of transplanted NSCs after transplantation were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF gene-transfected neural stem cells expressed gene products during the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NSS in this group was significantly lower compared with that in other 3 groups 12 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF gene-transfected NSCs migrated and expressed VEGF in hosts' brains, some of them differentiated to neurons 12 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF-transfected NSCs expressed gene products during the early time after transplantation, which reduce brain injury through protecting the vascular system against ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
