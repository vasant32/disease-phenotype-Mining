<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We explored the neurochemical mechanism of electroacupuncture's (EA) protective effect on brain function in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rats, using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion rats established by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, Sham+EA, MCAO and MCAO+EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats in Sham+EA and MCAO+EA were accepted EA treatment at 'GV26' and 'GV20' acupoints for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electric stimulation was produced by a G-6805 generator and neurological deficit scores were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria respiratory function and the activities of respiratory enzymes were measured by a computer-aided Clark oxygen electrode system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that EA treatment might reduce the neurological deficit score, and significantly improve respiratory control ratio (RCR), the index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory function, and increase the activities of succinic dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C oxidase in the MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that EA might markedly decrease the neurological deficit score, promote the activities of respiratory enzymes and reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in improvement of respiratory chain function and anti-oxidative capability of brain tissues in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This be a mechanism of EA's anti-injury effect on brain function in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
