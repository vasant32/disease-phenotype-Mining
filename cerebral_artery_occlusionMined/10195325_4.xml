<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new approach is presented for rapid and continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion which is based upon line-scan <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> column imaging with arterial spin tagging (AST) of endogenous water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spin tagging of arterial water protons is accomplished using adiabatic fast passage inversion, followed by acquisition of the perfusion sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal from a column placed at the desired level through the brain using line scan localization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A perfusion sensitive line scan is followed by a non-perfusion sensitive line scan, and perfusion is calculated pixel-by-pixel from the intensity difference of the two lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous perfusion measurements are reported with temporal resolution of 10 s in pixels of volume 0.027 cm3 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examples of the methodology are given during hypercapnic challenge induced with carbon dioxide, and during an ischemic event induced by reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method is also used to characterize the signal response as a function of arterial inversion time and post inversion acquisition delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These methods permit rapid and continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion with high spatial resolution, and can be interleaved with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements of diffusion and T1 to follow the progression of cerebral events during physiological or pharmacological intervention </plain></SENT>
