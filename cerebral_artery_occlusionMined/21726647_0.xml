<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine whether adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (AAV) mediated overexpression of netrin-1 improves post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurovascular structure and recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AAV-Netrin-1 or AAV-LacZ of 1Ã—10(10) genome copies each was injected medial and posterior to ischemic lesion at one hour following reperfusion using the distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression of netrin-1 transgene began as early as one day and increased dramatically about 3 weeks following vector injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy suggested that both the endogenous and transduced netrin-1 were expressed in the neurons of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AAV-mediated netrin-1 overexpression significantly increased vascular density in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex and promoted the migration of immature neurons into the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> white matter, but it did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 overexpression also enhanced post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> locomotor activity, improved exploratory behavior, and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced motor asymmetry in forelimb usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it had little effect on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> spatial learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that AAV mediated netrin-1 overexpression improves peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> vascular density and post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> motor function </plain></SENT>
