<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both ipsilesional and contralesional changes have been described, but it remains unclear how these relate to functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to correlate brain activation patterns with tissue damage, hemodynamics, and neurologic status after temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transverse relaxation time (T2)-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and perfusion MRI were performed at days 1 (n = 7), 3 (n = 7), and 14 (n = 7) after 2 hr unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional activation and cerebrovascular reactivity maps were generated from contrast-enhanced fMRI during forelimb stimulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before MRI, rats were examined neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We detected loss of activation responses in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, which was related to T2 lesion size (r = -0.858 on day 3, r = -0.979 on day 14; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant activation responses in the contralesional hemisphere were detected at days 1 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of shift in balance of activation between the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, characterized by the laterality index, was linked to the T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient in the ipsilesional contralesional forelimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex at day 1 (r = -0.807 and 0.782, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) and day 14 (r = -0.898 and -0.970, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between activation parameters and perfusion status or cerebrovascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that the laterality index and neurologic status changed in parallel over time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, so that when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points were grouped together, neurologic status was inversely correlated with the laterality index (r = -0.571; p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the degree of shift of activation balance toward the contralesional hemisphere early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases with the extent of tissue injury and that functional recovery is associated mainly with preservation or restoration of activation in the ipsilesional hemisphere </plain></SENT>
