<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that Gly14-HN (HNG), a variant of HN in which the 14th amino acid serine is replaced with glycine, can decrease apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we postulate that the mechanism of HNG's neuroprotective effect is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) was performed in cultured mouse primary cortical neurons for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of HNG and PI3K/Akt inhibitors on OGD-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was examined at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HNG increased cell viability after OGD in primary cortical neurons, whereas the PI3K/Akt inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and Akti-1/2 attenuated the protective effect of HNG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HNG rapidly increased Akt phosphorylation, an effect that was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and Akti-1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mouse brains were injected intraventricularly with HNG before being subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HNG treatment significantly elevated p-Akt levels after cerebral I/R injury and decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of HNG on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and Akti-1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken as a whole, these results suggest that PI3K/Akt activation mediates HNG's protective effect against <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
