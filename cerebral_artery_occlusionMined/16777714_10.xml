<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microglial cells play a key role in pathology produced following ischemic injury in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and possess TRPM2, which may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related pathological responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that TRPM2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is present in the human C13 microglial cell line and is reduced by antisense treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of C13 cells by interleukin-1beta leads to a fivefold increase of TRPM2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> demonstrating transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To confirm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> distribution correlated with functional expression, we combined electrophysiology, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> imaging, and antisense approaches </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patch-clamp recordings from C13 demonstrated that increased intracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> diphosphoribose (ADPR) or extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> induced an inward current, consistent with activation of TRPM2 </plain></SENT>
