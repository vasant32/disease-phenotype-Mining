<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of sequential diffusion-weighted (DW) and perfusion-weighted (PW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a recently developed porcine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and to evaluate the evolution of cerebral perfusion and the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods In five pigs, DW imaging (DWI) and PW imaging (PWI) was carried out for 7 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, starting 1 hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DWI lesion volume increased significantly with time, and final DWI lesion volume correlated well with lesion area on histological sections (r = 0.910) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2 changes could be recognized 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 hour the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio (ischemic lesion/contralateral side) was reduced to 0.81 in the caudate-putamen and to 0.87 in the cortex, and the cerebral blood flow ratio was reduced to 0.40 in the caudate-putamen and 0.51 in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The level of flow reduction in the caudate-putamen and the cortex after 1 hour is in good correlation with human thresholds of irreversible and reversible ischemic damage, and accordingly, this model might be a model for mechanisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution and therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
