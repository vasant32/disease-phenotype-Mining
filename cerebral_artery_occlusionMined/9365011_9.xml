<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the temporospatial evolution of ischaemic brain tissue towards <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> would be of crucial value to establish and validate therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic (PET) studies performed through the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages of infarction, we addressed the question of the effect of 6 h temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) on the evolution of the volume of severely hypometabolic tissue in anaesthetized baboons and compared it to that reported previously in permanently occluded baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen anaesthetized baboons underwent serial PET (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady-state technique) examinations before and 1, 4, 7, 24-48 h and 15-62 days following transorbital MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion, at 6 h post-occlusion, was assessed by Doppler sonography and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values after clip removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each baboon, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated by standard histological procedures 20-91 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severely hypometabolic tissue volume, as defined by a threshold of oxidative metabolism, showed a progressive increase for up to 24-48 h in a not dissimilar manner to that found in baboons with permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these hypometabolic volumes regressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent and temporary occluded baboons, when taken together, showed a highly significant relationship between histological and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypometabolic volumes (r = 0.84; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the final hypometabolic volume where cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was below 40% of contralateral metabolism corresponded well to that of histological infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in anaesthetized baboons, restoration of blood flow will reverse (even if not immediately) the progressive derangement of metabolism after MCAO and markedly limit the final volume of consolidated infarction.) </plain></SENT>
