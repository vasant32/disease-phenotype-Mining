<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that CD31⁻/CD146⁻ side population (SP) cells from porcine dental pulp exhibit highly vasculogenic potential in hindlimb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the influence of CD31⁻/CD146⁻ SP cells after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (TMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of TMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after TMCAO, CD31⁻/CD146⁻ SP cells were transplanted into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis and vasculogenesis were determined with immunochemical markers, and the levels of neurotrophic factors were assayed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cell transplantation group, the number of doublecortin-positive cells increased twofold, and the number of NeuN-positive cells increased eightfold, as compared with the control phosphate-buffered saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vascular endothelial growth factor level in the ischemic brain with transplanted cells was 28 times higher than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CD31⁻/CD146⁻ SP cells promoted migration and differentiation of the endogenous neuronal progenitor cells and induced vasculogenesis, and ameliorated ischemic brain injury after TMCAO </plain></SENT>
