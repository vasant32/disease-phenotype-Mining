<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact on cerebral protection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) preconditioning in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO); the relationship between cerebral protection of TSA and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β); and the impact of age on the mechanism of cerebral protection of TSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The modified suture method was used to create stable a MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 96 male SD rats were assigned randomly to four groups: a control group, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) preconditioned group, a low-dose (0.03 mg/kg) TSA-preconditioned group, and a high-dose (0.1 mg/kg) TSA-preconditioned group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each group included four sub-groups for reperfusion for 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours, respectively, 6 rats per sub-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional, eighteen healthy, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats that received TSA preconditioning (0.1 mg/kg) were divided into three groups based on their age: young, mid-age, and old, One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between groups, and the Spearman rank correlation was used to examine relationships between IL-1β concentrations in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume of rats in the high-dose TSA group was less than that of the other 3 groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-1β in blood and the cerebrospinal fluid of rats in the highdose TSA group was lower than that in control and DMSO groups (P&lt;0.05); for the low-dose TSA group IL-1β levels were statistically the same as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Spearman rank coefficients were 0.841 and 0.618 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume correlate to blood IL-1β and to cerebrospinal fluid IL-1β, respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume and IL-1β levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-dose TSA preconditioning reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume and decreases IL- 1β levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid; age does not affect these parameters </plain></SENT>
