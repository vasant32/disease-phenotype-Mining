<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to characterize the model by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate its potential role for the future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The left proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was embolized with an autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in six beagles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) were performed every half hour during the first six hours after occlusion, followed by three time points at 12 hours, 24 hours, and one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were carried out at six hours, 24 hours and one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PWI-DWI mismatch ratio was defined as (PWI-DWI)/DWI ischemic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were located in the left caudate nucleus and internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the lesions could be detected within two hours by DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume on DWI increased in a time dependent manner, from (87.19 ± 67.16) mm(3) at one hour up to (368.98 ± 217.05) mm(3) at 24 hours (P = 0.009), while that on PWI gradually decreased from (7315.00 ± 2054.38) mm(3) at six hours to (4900.33 ± 1319.71) mm(3) at 24 hours and (3334.33 ± 1195.11) mm(3) at one week (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mismatch ratio was 41.93 ± 22.75 at six hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, showing "extensive mismatch", and decreased to 18.10 ± 13.74 at 24 hours (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization was observed within 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lacunar infarction</z:e> induced by proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion could be detected early by DWI and was characterized by extensive PWI-DWI mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multimodal MRI is useful to demonstrate the natural evolution of PWI-DWI mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This ischemic model could be further used for investigating early thrombolysis in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showing extensive mismatch </plain></SENT>
