<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the serial changes and cellular localization of GAPDH expression, and its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the authors analyzed immunohistochemically brain areas of rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear overexpression of GAPDH was noted in the ischemic core area after 2 hours of MCAO without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the subsequent reperfusion, nuclear accumulation of GAPDH in this area decreased in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, cytoplasmic and nuclear GAPDH immunoreactivity was detected in neurons of the penumbra area of the parietal cortex, in rats subjected to 2-hour MCAO followed by 3-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase of nuclear GAPDH immunoreactivity was persistently noted up to 48 hours of reperfusion, whereas cytoplasmic immunoreactivity correlated inversely with the duration of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, double staining revealed colocalization of nuclear GAPDH and TUNEL in the penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors' study demonstrated that overexpression of GAPDH and nuclear translocation occurred in both the ischemic core and penumbra area soon after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These processes could be viewed as an early marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that GAPDH may play a critical role in the progression and spread of ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
