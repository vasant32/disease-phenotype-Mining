<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, Delta(9)-THC significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a 4 h mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of Delta(9)-THC was completely abolished by SR141716, cannabinoid CB(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and by warming the animals to 31 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delta(9)-THC significantly decreased the rectal temperature, and the hypothermic effect was also inhibited by SR141716 and by warming to 31 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, Delta(9)-THC significantly increased the expression level of CB(1) receptor in both the striatum and cortex, but not in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Warming to 31 degrees C during 4 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> did not increase the expression of CB(1) receptor at the striatum and cortex in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that the neuroprotective effect of Delta(9)-THC is mediated by a temperature-dependent mechanism via the CB(1) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, warming to 31 degrees C might attenuate both the neuroprotective and hypothermic effects of Delta(9)-THC through inhibiting the increase in CB(1) receptor in both the striatum and cortex but not in the hypothalamus, which may suggest a new thermoregulation mechanism of Delta(9)-THC </plain></SENT>
