<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy male SD rats were randomized into sham-operation (sham, n = 10), model (n = 30) and SA (n = 30) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The later 2 groups were further divided into 24 h, 48 h and 72 h subgroups respectively, with 10 cases in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CI-R model was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture (2 mA, 2 Hz/100 Hz) was applied to "Dingnie Houxiexian" (MS 7) and "Dingnie Qianxiexian" (MS 6) for 30 min, once every 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes of the animal behavior were observed by using neurological severity score (NSS), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) contents and their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following modeling, the NSS at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after MCAO increased significantly, while compared with model group, NSS of SA group at the 3 time-points decreased considerably (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), suggesting an improvement of the neurological functions after SA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with sham group, NF-kappaB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and COX-2 mRNA, and NF-kappaB and COX-2 protein expression of model group in the infarcted cerebral tissue were significantly upregulated at the 3 time-points (P &lt; 0.01) except NF-KB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 72 h (no significant change), while compared with the 3 time-points of model group, NF-kappaB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and COX-2 mRNA, and NF-KB and COX-2 protein expression of SA group were downregulated obviously (P &lt; 0.01) except COX-2 mRNA at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced upregulation of NF-kappaB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and COX-2 mRNA, and NF-kappaB and COX-2 protein expression, which may contribute to its effect in promoting neurofunctional rehabilitation of CI-R rats by reducing cytokines-mediated inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
