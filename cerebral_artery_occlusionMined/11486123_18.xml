<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) rapidly drops in ischemic tissue after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> drop is thought to be caused by the loss of extracellular fluid and the gain of intracellular fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the latter possibility, changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and the size of several cellular compartments were assessed in 3 regions of rat brain at the end of 90 minutes of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded in 8 Sprague-Dawley rats; sham occlusions were performed in 2 other rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps were generated 90 minutes later, and the brains were immediately perfusion fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three regions of interest (ROIs) were defined on the basis of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various neuronal, astrocytic, and capillary compartments in each ROI were quantified with light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of 90 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the cortex of sham-operated rats and the contralateral cortex of ischemic rats (ROI-a), 25% lower in the ipsilateral frontoparietal cortex (ROI-b), and 45% lower in the ischemic lateral caudoputamen (ROI-c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time, the frequency of swollen astrocytic cell bodies and volume of swollen dendrites and astrocytic processes in neuropil were ROI-a&lt;ROI-b&lt;ROI-c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ROI-b and ROI-c, 40% and 60% of the neurons, respectively, were shrunken; the shrunken neurons were approximately 25% smaller in ROI-c than in ROI-b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these areas, many capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and perivascular foot processes were swollen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The initial lowering of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> probably is the result of not only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> loss of extracellular fluid and concomitant swelling of various cellular compartments but also concurrent neuronal shrinkage </plain></SENT>
