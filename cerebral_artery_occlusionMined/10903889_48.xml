<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present evidence that calpain is a protease involved in the conversion of p35 to p25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To activate calpain, rat cerebellar granule neurons were treated with maitotoxin (MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A C-terminus-directed anti-p35 antibody detected that p35 conversion to p25 paralleled the formation of calpain-generated alpha-spectrin (alpha-fodrin) breakdown products (SBDP's) in a maitotoxin-dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two calpain inhibitors (MDl28170 and SJA6017) reduced p35 processing but were unchanged when exposed to the caspase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51097">carbobenzoxy</z:chebi>-Asp-CH(2)OC(=O)-2, 6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23697">dichlorobenzene</z:chebi> or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi> and Z<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Glu(OtBu)Ala-Leu-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p35 protein was also degraded to p25 when rat brain lysate was subjected to in vitro digestion with purified mu- and m-calpains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in a rat temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, p35 processing to p25 again paralleled SBDP formation in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in malonate-injured rat brains, the ipsilateral side showed a striking correlation of SBDP formation with p35 to p25 conversion and tau phosphorylation (at Ser202 and Thr205) increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that calpain is a major neuronal protease capable of converting p35 to p25 and might play a pathological role of activating cdk5 and its phosphorylation of tau in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
