<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of the endogenous neuronal compound N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) as a marker of neuronal damage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) the ischemic cortex was sampled, guided by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining, and the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> concentration was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional histology and immunohistological methods using antibodies against neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilaments (NF), synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and carbodiamide-linked <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> rapidly declined to 50% and 20% of control levels in infarcted tissue after 6 hours and 24 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No further decrease was observed during the observation period of 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the first 6 hours the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing neurons in the infarcted cortical tissue decreased to 70% of control, of which the majority were eosinophilic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours almost no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing neurons were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of eosinophilic neurons decreased steadily to virtually zero after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of immunopositive cells in the NSE, NF, and synaptophysin staining within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was progressively reduced, and after 3 to 7 days the immunoreactions were confined to discrete granulomatous structures in the center of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, which otherwise was infested with macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This granulomatous material also stained positive for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of cells with positive GFAP immunoreactions progressively increased in the circumference of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They also showed increased immunoreaction against <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and NSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study shows that the level of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> does not decline to zero but remains at 10% to 20% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The fact <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> is trapped in cell debris and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> immunoreactivity is observed in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas restricts its use as a marker of neuronal density </plain></SENT>
