<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were compared during the short- (4.5 hours) and long-term (up to 6 days) reperfusion after 80 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and correlated with the histology analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On occlusion, average CBF fell from approximately 100 to less than 50 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) in the cortex, and to less than 20 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) in the caudate putamen (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values decreased from (6.98 +/- 0.82) x 10(-4) to (5.49 +/- 0.54) x 10(-4) mm2/s in the cortex, and from (7.16 +/- 0.58) x 10(-4) to (4.86 +/- 0.62) x 10(-4) mm2/s in the CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average, CBF recovered to approximately 50% of baseline in the first 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 to 4 days, a strong hyperperfusion in the ipsilateral cortex and CP, up to approximately 300 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1), was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio in the ipsilateral and contralateral CP was also inverted in the late reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed more severe tissue damage at the late stage of reperfusion than at 4.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant reversal of CBF and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> during the late reperfusion period may reflect the impairment of autoregulation in the ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular factors may play an important role in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development after 80-minute focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
