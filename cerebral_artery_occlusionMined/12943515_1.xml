<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of NR2A and NR2B receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> up-regulated in cortex after 3 h of reperfusion following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was accompanied by an increase in NR2A and NR2B immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At six hours of reperfusion, drastic activation of NR2A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed in the penumbra that returned to the control level at 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monitoring of NR2A autoantibodies in the blood of the experimental rats showed its reliable increase to the 5-6th day of reperfusion that maintained elevated to the 20th day of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that NR2A and 2B receptor subunits and NR2A autoantibodies are biochemical markers of the neurotoxicity underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
