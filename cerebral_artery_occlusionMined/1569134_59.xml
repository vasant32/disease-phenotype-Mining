<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of selective modulation of brain temperature in the experimental settings of permanent and reversible middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three models of proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were used, in which the effect of brain-temperature modulations could be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included (a) permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with an initial 30-min period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (30 or 36 degrees C x 4 h), (b) permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion alone (30, 36, or 39 degrees C x 2 h), and (c) 2 h of reversible <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (30, 36, or 39 degrees C x 2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion series, intra- and postischemic cortical blood flow was assessed using a laser-Doppler flowmeter placed over the dorsolateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 3-day survival, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were perfusion fixed for histopathological analysis and the determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals with permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was demonstrated between the 30 and 36 degrees C groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats with permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, significant differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were again not demonstrable, but an interaction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and temperature class was shown by repeated-measures analysis, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> altered the topographic pattern of the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With 2 h of reversible <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, there was a statistically significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the 30 degrees C group compared to 39 degrees C rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although intra- and postischemic CBF were not significantly different among the three temperature groups, the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was positively correlated with postischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postischemic CBF, in turn, was positively correlated to the intraischemic brain temperature and was negatively correlated to CBF during the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that moderate manipulations of brain temperature have a greater influence on the resulting cortical infarction in the setting of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than in the context of permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
