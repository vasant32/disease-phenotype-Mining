<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, complications are frequent especially in aged Fisher-344 rats undergoing endovascular suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyzing our experiences with 165 Wistar, 13 Sprague-Dawley and 10 F-344 rats, we compared the incidence of impossible thread advancement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was applied to study the course of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in Fischer and Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we performed a structured review of the literature from 1991 to 2005 evaluating reports on Fischer rats subjected to intraluminal filament MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications like fruitless filament advancement or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were found to be significantly more frequent in Fischer rats than in other strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA revealed significantly more pronounced kinking of the ICA in F-344 than in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven publications available on filament MCAO in F-344 rats, complication rates of 50-100% were reported, corroborating our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical difficulties accompanied by high complication rates due to their cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> make Fischer rats unsuitable for filament MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the use of Fischer rats for studies on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is indicated, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models than intraluminal suture occlusion should be chosen </plain></SENT>
