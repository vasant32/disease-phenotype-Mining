<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the brain, three isoforms (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) are widely distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear to what extent these isoforms are involved in ischemic brain damage in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore used genetically altered mice and isoform-selective NCX inhibitors in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to investigate the role of each NCX isoform in ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NCX isoform-mutant mice (NCX1(+/-), NCX2(+/-), and NCX3(+/-)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were subjected to 90min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of three NCX inhibitors [SN-6, KB-R7943, or SEA0400 (3 or 10mgkg(-1), i.p.)] was administered to ddY mice at 30min before more prolonged (4-h) MCAO followed by 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transient MCAO reperfusion, the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in NCX1(+/-) mice, but not those in NCX2(+/-) or NCX3(+/-) mice, were significantly smaller than those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SN-6 and SEA0400, which are more selective for the NCX1 isoform, significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 10mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, KB-R7943, which is more selective for NCX3, did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the NCX1 isoform may act preferentially (vs. the NCX2 and NCX3 isoforms) to exacerbate the cerebral damage caused by ischemic insult in mice, and that NCX1-selective inhibitors warrant investigation as a potential therapeutic agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
