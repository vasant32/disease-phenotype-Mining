<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asialo-erythropoietin (AEPO) is a potent tool for targeting an ischemic region by binding to the EPO receptors on neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it shows a strong cytoprotective effect against programed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, AEPO-modified liposomes appear likely to have both a neuronal-targeting character and a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the targeting ability of AEPO-modified PEGylated liposomes (AEPO-liposomes) to ischemic region and their improvement effect on neurological deficits induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) in transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (t-MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analysis showed that the AEPO-liposomes given immediately after reperfusion extravasated into the ischemic region and attached strongly to neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was clearly visible only in the AEPO-liposome-treated group, suggesting that AEPO-liposomes protected neuronal cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a single administration of low-dose AEPO-liposomes significantly improved the neurological deficit compared to vehicle and free-AEPO treatment at 7 days after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AEPO-liposomes have clear potential as a neuroprotectant after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and as a DDS device targeting ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
