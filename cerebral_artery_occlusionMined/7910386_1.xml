<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study the in vitro and ex vivo distributions of [3H]dizocilpine binding sites in mouse brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O) were compared using receptor autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution patterns of [3H]dizocilpine binding sites obtained in vitro and ex vivo in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse brain were the same with the highest densities occurring in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O had little or no effect on the in vitro binding density for at least 24 hr post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However after 2-3 days binding densities in the region of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were significantly reduced compared to the contralateral cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further reductions occurred after 5-7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast ex vivo [3H]dizocilpine binding was reduced in the infarcted area by 78.7 +/- 4% within 2 hr of the ischaemic insult and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent times binding was reduced by more than 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo binding after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was always less than 30% of in vitro binding and this decrease was apparent within 2 hr of the ischaemic insult whereas in vitro binding was maintained at control levels for at least 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> dizocilpine and CGP 37849 in this model at different times after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time scale for receptor access following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O is discussed and it is suggested that although the population of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors is maintained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region for some days access to them in vivo may be sufficiently impaired within 2 or 4 hr of ischaemic insult to reduce the neuroprotective activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> after this time </plain></SENT>
