<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered either saline or a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>; the non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 or the AMPA receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> NBQX which are known to be able to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The saline treated rats showed presence of Fos protein in nerve cell nuclei throughout the cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> borderzone, but no staining in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core or contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK-801 almost totally abolished this expression of Fos protein whereas NBQX had no significant effect on Fos protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the Fos protein induction is due to repeated spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> borderzone, and that Fos protein due to its persistence in the tissue can be used as a histochemical marker of borderzone tissue at risk for eventually becoming recruited in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
