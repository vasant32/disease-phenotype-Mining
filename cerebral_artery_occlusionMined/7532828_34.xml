<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size developed following inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> analogues whereas intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> dose-dependently decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the same models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> administration was associated with enhanced blood flow within the perinfarct zone as demonstrated by simultaneous recording of rCBF and electrocorticogram activity within subjacent brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective NOS inhibition by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at doses of 25 and 50 mg kg and in amounts that did not decrease the response of pial vessels to topical <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together these data suggest that enhanced NO production within the cerebrovasculature protects brain tissue during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> via hemodynamic mechanisms whereas neuronal overproduction may facilitate or mediate neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent data using transgenic animals lacking NOS activity support the latter conclusion </plain></SENT>
