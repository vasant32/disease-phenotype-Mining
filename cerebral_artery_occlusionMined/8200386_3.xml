<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the confounding effect of decreased flow on iomazenil uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery of four rats was occluded, and the animals were simultaneously injected with 25 microCi of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-125 iomazenil and 500 microCi of the blood flow tracer [123I]iofetamine (N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats, including two sham, were sacrificed 1 h after injection, a time when uptake of both agents is nearly maximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control experiments showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> for 1 h did not affect the total number of BZ binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a dual autoradiographic technique, the uptake of both [123I]iofetamine and [125I]iomazenil was measured in more than 200 regions showing variable levels of reduced flow and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral homotypic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The straight line fit of % [125I]iomazenil (y axis) versus % [123I]iofetamine (x axis) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 200 regions had a slope of 0.74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insofar as the rat is an accurate model of human subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, these studies suggest that decreased flow to the epileptogenic focus will linearly exacerbate the decrease in uptake secondary to neuropathologic loss of BZ receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, for localization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> focus, a single SPET image of [123I]iomazenil in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patient may have greater sensitivity than a comparable blood flow image, because the former is enhanced by both decreased flow and a loss of BZ receptors </plain></SENT>
