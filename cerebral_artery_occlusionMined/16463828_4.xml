<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of ischemic preconditioning, produced by 2 min proximal temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, on brain tissue gases and acidity during clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received standard <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After craniotomy, a calibrated multiparameter catheter was inserted to measure oxygen (PtO2) tension, carbon dioxide (PtCO2) tension and pH (pHt) in tissue at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients assigned to the preconditioning group, proximal artery was occluded initially for 2 min and was allowed to reperfuse for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of change in PtO2, PtCO2 and pHt after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were compared between groups using unpaired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline brain tissue gases and pHt were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the decline in PtO2 and pHt were significantly slower in the preconditioning group compared with the routine care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that ischemic preconditioning attenuates tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brief occlusion of the proximal artery may be a simple maneuver for brain protection during complex cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
