<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few studies that evaluate the therapeutic benefits of intracerebral and intravenous BMSC transplantation for cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to clarify the favorable route of cell delivery for cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMSC were labeled with near infrared (NIR)-emitting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dots</z:chebi> and were transplanted stereotactically (1 × 10⁶ cells) or intravenously (3 × 10⁶ cells) at 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging technique, the behaviors of BMSC were serially visualized during 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor function was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the fate of the engrafted BMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral, but not intravenous, transplantation of BMSC significantly enhanced functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo NIR fluorescence imaging could clearly visualize their migration toward the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> during 4 weeks after transplantation in the intracerebral group, but not in the intravenous, group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BMSC were widely distributed in the ischemic brain and some of them expressed neural cell markers in the intracerebral group, but not in the intravenous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that intravenous administration of BMSC has limited effectiveness at clinically relevant timing and intracerebral administration should be chosen for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, although further studies would be warranted to establish the treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
