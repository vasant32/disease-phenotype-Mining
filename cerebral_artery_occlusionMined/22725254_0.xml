<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to assess its optimal timing and cell dose for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BMSCs were harvested from the green fluorescent protein-transgenic rats and were labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dots</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BMSCs (1 × 10(5) or 1 × 10(6) ) were stereotactically transplanted into the ipsilateral striatum of the rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at 1 or 4 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor function was serially assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using in vivo near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, the engrafted BMSCs were visualized at 3 weeks post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate their fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was significantly enhanced when both low and high doses of BMSCs were transplanted at 1 week post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but such therapeutic effects were observed only when the high-dose BMSCs were transplanted at 4 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both optical imaging and immunohistochemistry revealed their better engraftment in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area when the high-dose BMSCs were transplanted at 1 or 4 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest the importance of timing and cell dose to yield therapeutic effects of BMSC transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier transplantation requires a smaller number of donor cells for beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
