<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters, EAAT2 is responsible for up to 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transport and has been reported to be associated to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, we have recently shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> induces EAAT2 translocation to the membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> preserves membrane stability by recovering levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> present in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts, we have decided to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> increases association of EAAT2 transporter to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flotillin-1 was used as a marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts due to its known association to these microdomains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After gradient centrifugation, we have found that flotillin-1 appears mainly in fractions 2 and 3 and that EAAT2 protein is predominantly found colocalised with flotillin-1 in fraction 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> increased EAAT2 levels in fraction 2 at both times examined (3 and 6 h after 1 g/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> administration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this, [(3)H] <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake was also increased in flotillin-associated vesicles obtained from brain homogenates of animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> also increased EAAT2 levels in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts, an effect which was further enhanced in those animals receiving 2 g/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> 4 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume measured at 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed a reduction in the group treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> 4 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> redistributes EAAT2 to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft microdomains and improves <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect is also found after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> is administered 4 h after the ischemic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since we have also shown that this delayed post-ischemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> induces a potent neuroprotection, our data provides a novel target for neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
