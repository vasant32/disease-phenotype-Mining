<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 108 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups: sham-operated group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group, vehicle group and MCAO+ADSCs-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat's focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established by right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with modified Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADSCs were pre-labeled by CFSE before the transplantation into the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 d after MCAO, 30 μL cell suspension which contained 1×10(6); ADSCs was injected into the lateral ventricle of MCAO+ADSCs-treated rats, and the same dose of PBS was given to the rats of vehicle group as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO, rats were decapitated to detect the TGF-β1 expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of TGF-β1 in brain tissues in MCAO+ADSCs-treated group was significantly higher than MCAO group and vehicle group at 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After transplantation into MCAO rats, ADSCs could survive and express TGF-β1 in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that ADSCs transplantation can promote revascularization in cerebral ischemic rats, partly by promoting TGF-β1 expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
