<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraluminal suture middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of rat was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">Propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> was injected immediately after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was happened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of NF-kappaB, and the expression of COX-2 and HSP70 on the peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were determined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of TNF-alpha was determined by ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were employed to detect the transcription and expression of TLR-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> could inhibit the activity of NF-kappaB in the peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and reduce the expression of COX-2 and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the upstream of NF-kappaB, the transcription and expression of TLR-4 decreased, as well as HSP70, the endogenic ligand of TLR-4 </plain></SENT>
