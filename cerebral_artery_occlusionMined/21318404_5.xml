<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is quite necessary to further explore the characteristic and mechanism of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We induced a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in male rats for defining the time course of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability within 120 h following reperfusion and evaluate the specific role of tight junction (TJ) associated proteins claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 as well as protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) pathway in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage induced by reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We verified a bimodal increase in the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by Evans blue assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two peaks of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability appeared at 3 h and 72 h of reperfusion after 2 h focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The leak at the endothelial cell was represented at the level of transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTC staining results showed increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size with time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of these three TJ associated proteins were significantly decreased compared with the sham-operated group within 120 h of reperfusion, corresponding to the time-dependent change of the biphasic pattern in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The redistribution of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> brain microvascular endothelial cells was observed at the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, Western blot assay revealed PKCδ level was also significantly increased in a similar biphasic pattern to above results within 120 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the timing of TJ associated proteins claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 in light of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion, and suggests PKCδ pathway may participate in TJ barrier open and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage during reperfusion injury in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
