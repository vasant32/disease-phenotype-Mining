<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the appropriate conditions of exercise and the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are not yet known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect exercise intensity on memory function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90min to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were randomly assigned to four groups; Low-Ex, High-Ex, Non-Ex and Sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the fourth day after surgery, rats in the Low-Ex and High-Ex groups were forced to exercise using a treadmill for 30min every day for four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Memory functions were examined during the last 5 days of the experiment (27-32 days after MCAO) by three types of tests: an object recognition test, an object location test and a passive avoidance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the final memory test, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, number of neurons and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus were analyzed by histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Memory functions in the Low-Ex group were improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the High-Ex group, only the passive avoidance test improved, but not the object recognition or object location tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the Low-Ex and High-Ex groups had reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the number of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the Low-Ex and High-Ex groups was increased, the number for the Low-Ex group increased more than that for the High-Ex group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover hippocampal MAP2 immunoreactivity in the High-Ex group was reduced compared to that in the Low-Ex group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the effects of exercise on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> depend on exercise intensity </plain></SENT>
