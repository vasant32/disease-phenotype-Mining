<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence emphasizes B-cells as a major regulatory cell type that plays an important role in limiting the pathogenic effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to extend this initial observation to specifically examine the infiltration of regulatory B-cells and to determine if the effect of B-cells to limit the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is mediated by their action centrally or peripherally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate the increased presence of a regulatory B-cell subset in the affected hemisphere of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further explored the use of a novel method of stereotaxic cell delivery to bypass the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and introduce CD19(+) B-cells directly into the striatum as compared to peripheral administration of B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes after 60 minutes of MCAO and 48 hours of reperfusion were determined in B-cell deficient μMT( -/- ) mice with and without replacement of either B-cells or medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly decreased in cerebral cortex after intrastriatal transfer of 100,000 B-cells to μMT(-/-) mice vs. controls, with a comparable effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size as obtained by 50 million B-cells transferred intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that B-cells play a protective role against ischemic brain injury, and suggest that B-cells may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for modulating the immune response in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
