<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to consecutively evaluate the cerebral blood flow changes in a focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rat model during the occlusion-reperfusion procedure and along the recovery stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAo/r) surgery was conducted, which combines a permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and a transient occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) with a monofilament introduced from the proximal ICA towards the distal right ICA then removed after 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity (BFV) from the concerned arteries were measured using ultrasonography (13-4 MHz) at the basal stage before the surgery, after the reperfusion stage and during the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At reperfusion stage and after, BFV increased significantly in the left ICA and in the basilar artery (BA) (starting from post-24 h, p &lt; 0.05 vs. basal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BFV were reversed in the distal right ICA and reflow was recorded in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time-average maximum BFV in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at reperfusion and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 24-96 h was decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05 vs. basal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reversed flow in the right ICA was enabled by the settlement of the collateral supply through the circle of Willis which consisted in higher BFV in the opposite ICA and in the BA still 24 h, although the proximal right ICA remain occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound measurement of BFV helps to provide information on the redistribution of the blood flow supply after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
