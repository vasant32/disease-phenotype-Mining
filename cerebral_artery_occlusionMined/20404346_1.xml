<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report that bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin, a novel dimeric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> subtype A receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, is such an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin voltage-dependently, selectively, and moderately inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-activated currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin increased with the rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and glycine concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetics analysis showed that the inhibition was of fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and offset with an off-rate time constant of 1.9 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular docking simulations showed moderate hydrophobic interaction between bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin and the MK-801 binding region in the ion channel pore of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin was further found to compete with [(3)H]MK-801 with a K(i) value of 0.27 mum, and the mutation of NR1(N616R) significantly reduced its inhibitory potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated pathological conditions, bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin, in contrast to bis(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24526">heptyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin, prevented excitotoxicity with increasing effectiveness against escalating levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and much more effectively protected against middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced brain damage than did memantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor-mediated physiological conditions, bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin <z:mp ids='MP_0003008'>enhanced long-term potentiation</z:mp> in hippocampal slices, whereas MK-801 reduced and memantine did not alter this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that bis(<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>)-cognitin is a UFO <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors with moderate affinity, which may provide a pathologically activated therapy for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor dysregulation </plain></SENT>
