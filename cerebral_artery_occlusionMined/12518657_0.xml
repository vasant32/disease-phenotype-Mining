<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aspirin reduces the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this fact has been attributed to its antiplatelet actions, direct neuroprotective effects have been also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that aspirin is neuroprotective by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in "in vitro" models of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pharmacological dissection of the components involved, using cell cortical culture exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, indicated that aspirin selectively inhibits the increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration which results from reversal of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter, a component of release which is due to ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neuroprotection afforded by aspirin occurred in parallel to a lesser decay in ATP levels after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin not only elevated ATP levels in intact cortical neurones, but also in isolated brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, using a whole-animal model of permanent focal brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (MCAO; middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>), wed have also demonstrated that aspirin (30 mg/Kg i.p. administered 2 h before the occlusion) produced a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, effect that correlated with the inhibition caused by aspirin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced increase in brain and serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin also inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced decrease in brain ATP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, clinical studies showed that prior treatment with aspirin was associated with a lower risk of neurological deterioration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> which was related to a reduction of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our present findings show a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of aspirin, that takes place at concentrations in the antiaggregant-<z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> range, useful in the management of patients with risk of ischaemic events </plain></SENT>
