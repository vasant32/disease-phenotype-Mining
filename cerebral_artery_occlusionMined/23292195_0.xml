<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HSP70s play a crucial role in protecting cells, tissues, organs and animals from various noxious conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the dynamic expression changes and localization of HSPA12B after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with reperfusion induced ischemic insult processes in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>, as indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, was also increased in the peri-ischemic cortex compared to non-ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of HSPA12B was strongly induced in the ischemic hemisphere of MCAO reperfusion rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies indicated that the up-regulation of HSPA12B may be involved in oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced PC12 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And knockdown of HSPA12B in cultured differentiated PC12 cells by siRNA showed that HSPA12B inhibited the expression of active caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results suggested that HSPA12B may be required for protecting neurons from ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
