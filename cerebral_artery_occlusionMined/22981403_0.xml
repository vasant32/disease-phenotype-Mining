<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accumulated evidences have established that inflammatory damage plays an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> is well known as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we designed this study to investigate the potential protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the mechanisms underlying in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> was administrated at dose of 4, 10, or 20mg/kg at 30 min before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured at 24h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used for examining the mediators involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including the positive regulators dishevelled (Dvl) and β-catenin, the negative regulators <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC), and P-β-catenin, as well as the downstream targets Bcl-2, Bax and claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with Vehicle group, 20mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> reduced neurological deficits, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> upregulated the expression of Dvl, β-catenin, Bcl2 and claudin-5, and downregulated APC, P-β-catenin and Bax compared with Vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> had a significant beneficial effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; this effect may be correlated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
