<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To probe into the establishing method and the evaluating system for rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with qi deficiency and blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stasis syndrome</z:e> (QDBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of QDBS was established by continual exhaustive swimming followed with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and evaluated by analyzing the changes of exterior signs, tongue figure, hemorrheologic characters and brain histomorphology in the model rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model rats showed a state of QDBS in the course of continual exhaustive swimming, such as slower <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, postponed food intake, darker tongue and longer sublingual veins; and presented the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with QDBS syndrome after MCAO, they were inactive, weak, and hemiplegic, with dark purple tongue and longer blue sublingual veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hemorrheologic examinations showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>blood hyperviscosity</z:hpo> and high platelet aggregation rate, and histomorphologic examinations showed a special figure of ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continual exhausting swimming followed by MCAO is a method for establishing a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with QDBS syndrome, and its evaluating system could be constituted by multiple criteria, including exterior signs, tongue figure, hemorrheologic and histomorphologic indexes, etc </plain></SENT>
