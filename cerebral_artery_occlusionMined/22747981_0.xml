<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of this hormone prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> attenuates the damage associated with such events in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)), although its therapeutic value when administered post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we evaluated the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment after permanent MCAO (pMCAO) was induced in rats, studying the PI3K/AKT/GSK3/β-catenin survival pathway and the activation of SAPK-JNK in two brain areas differently affected by pMCAO: the cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> on the glial response to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male rats were subjected to pMCAO and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (0.04 mg/kg) was administered 6, 24, and 48 h after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 6 h after the last treatment, and brain damage was evaluated by immunohistochemical quantification of 'reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>' using antibodies against GFAP and Iba1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Akt, phospho-Akt(Ser473), phospho-Akt(Thr308), GSK3, phospho-GSK3(Ser21/9), β-catenin, SAPK-JNK, and pSAPK-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185) levels were determined in western blots of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and regional differences in neuronal phospho-Akt expression were determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increases in the percentage of GFAP- (5.25-fold) and Iba1- (1.8-fold) labeled cells in the cortex and hippocampus indicate that pMCAO induced 'reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was prevented by post-ischemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment; diminished the number of these cells to those comparable with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pMCAO down-regulated the PI3K/AkT/GSK3/β-catenin survival pathway to different extents in the cortex and hippocampus, the activity of which was restored by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment more efficiently in the cerebral cortex (the most affected region) than in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No changes in the phosphorylation of SAPK-JNK were observed 54 h after inducing pMCAO, whereas pMCAO did significantly decrease the phospho-Akt(Ser473) in neurons, an effect that was reversed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that post-pMCAO <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment attenuates ischemic injury in both neurons and glia, events in which the PI3K/AKT/GSK3/β-catenin pathway is at least partly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> is a potentially useful treatment to enhance recovery after human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
