<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">Platinum</z:chebi> electrodes served for simultaneous recordings of regional cerebral blood flow, auditory evoked potentials, and electroencephalogram in the left and right auditory cortex and in the left medial geniculate body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Auditory evoked potentials and regional cerebral blood flow were also recorded in the subcortical white matter, and regional cerebral blood flow was recorded in the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distal segment occlusion of the middle cerebral artery caused severe cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in four of 11 rabbits (Group I), accompanied by abolition of the auditory evoked potential in the left auditory cortex and white matter and severe reduction of the left electrocorticogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deep subcortical regions were affected either little or not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining seven rabbits (Group II) with only mild disturbance of cortical perfusion after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, additional clamping of the proximal middle cerebral artery stem reduced thalamocortical tract blood flow and abolished cortical auditory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous electrocorticogram was less affected in Group II than in Group I; thalamic regional cerebral blood flow and auditory evoked potentials were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, ischemic lesions predominated in the cortex of Group I and in the subcortical structures of Group II rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While correlated reductions in regional cerebral blood flow and auditory evoked potentials indicate effective cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the impairment of auditory evoked potentials in Group II rabbits must be due to cortical deafferentation by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the afferent tract </plain></SENT>
