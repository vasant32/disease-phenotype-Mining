<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GFAP content was assessed semiquantitatively by ELISA and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GFAP immunoreactivity was determined for each animal separately in protein fractions obtained from the ipsilateral, lesioned cortex and the contralateral, unlesioned cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the GFAP content of the lesioned cortex with respect to that of the unlesioned cortex were calculated for each fraction individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFAP was detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protein fractions with a significant amount recovered from the aqueous extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A pronounced increase in the GFAP content of the lesioned cortex was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As measured by ELISA, this increase was maximal 5 days after injury and significantly more pronounced for the soluble and the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100-soluble protein fractions (mean increase 7 days after lesion, 281.4 and 240.2%, respectively) than for the crude cytoskeletal fraction (mean increase, 153.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A small and transient increase in GFAP immunoreactivity was also found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protein fractions prepared from the contralateral, unlesioned cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
