<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression and proteolytic cleavage of neurocan are developmentally regulated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat brain, and the full-length neurocan is detected in juvenile brains but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some studies showed that the full-length neurocan was detectable even in the adult brain when it was exposed to mechanical incision or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated by Western blot analysis that the full-length neurocan transiently appeared in the peri-ischemic region of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in adult rat with a peak level at 4 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that a clear positive signal of neurocan was observed 4 days after tMCAO in the peri-ischemic region of cerebral cortex and caudate, where cells strongly positive in GFAP expression were also distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that accumulation of the full-length neurocan produced by reactive astrocytes may be one of the processes for tissue repair and reconstruction of neural networks after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
