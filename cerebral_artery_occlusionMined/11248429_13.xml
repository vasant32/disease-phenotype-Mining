<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neither the chemical identity nor the cellular location of these <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify the origin of MRS <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signals in rat brain after temporary (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fatty acyl proton signals were detected by short-echo one and two dimensional (1)H MRS in superfused brain slices from the infarcted hemisphere 1-5 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensities of these signals were strongly correlated with the amount of triacylglyceride and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extracts from the samples (r(2)=0.96, P&lt;0.05) and were not correlated with the amount of free fatty acids in the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological staining of tissue revealed the presence of neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets in infarcted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dual labeling by immunohistochemistry demonstrated that these droplets were localized to microglia/macrophage (OX-42-labeled cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that (1)H MRS <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> signals from brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> arise from microglia/macrophage phagocytosis of cellular membranes </plain></SENT>
