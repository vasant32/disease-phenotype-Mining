<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PKN is a fatty acid- and Rho-activated serine/threonine kinase, which has a catalytic domain highly homologous to that of protein kinase C (PKC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that PKN is proteolytically cleaved after apoptotic stimulation and then a constitutively active 55-kDa fragment is generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of the 55-kDa fragment are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats underwent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and the temporal and spatial changes in the fragmentation of PKN and of PKC delta were examined by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No proteolytic fragment of PKC delta (about 40 kDa) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 55-kDa fragment of PKN appeared transiently from 3 days after MCAO at the ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the boundary zone of infarction, the 55-kDa fragment was markedly induced from day 5 then peaked on day 21 and persisted until day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37712">phosphoserine</z:chebi> immunoprecipitates with an anti-PKN antibody revealed phosphorylation of the 55-kDa band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Double staining for PKN and Ox42 was used to examine the source of the 55-kDa fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PKN immunoreactivity was significantly increased in Ox42-positive cells (microglia/hematogenous macrophages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No DNA laddering and only a few terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were observed on day 14 in despite of the high level appearance of the 55-kDa band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the constitutively active 55-kDa fragment of PKN does not contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but may contribute to a function of microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
