<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before and after surgery, the animals underwent neurological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the rats with a score &gt; or = 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed a significant increase in neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive neurones and absence of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive cells and survived up to the sixth day; conversely, the rats with a score &lt; 12 at the neurological evaluation 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed a progressive significant decrease in neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive neurones and appearance of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive cells and none of the rats survived up to the sixth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microglia cells were activated in both groups but only in the latter did these cells express inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area demonstrated that it occupied a similar territory in both groups of rats but in those with a score &lt; 12 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was more extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that a neurotoxic insult such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can induce neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression in the neurones and that when neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive neurones increase in number, microglia activation is less extended, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive cells are absent, tissue damage reduced and the rats survive longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, when there is a significant decrease of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive neurones, microglia cells are intensely activated, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-immunoreactive cells appear and the animal survival is shortened </plain></SENT>
