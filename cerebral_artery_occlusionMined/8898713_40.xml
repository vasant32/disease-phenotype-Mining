<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the induction of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-inducible form of cyclo-oxygenase, COX-2, during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked unilateral induction of COX-2 mRNA was detected in ischemic regions ipsilateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in COX-2 mRNA was detected in "core" and "penumbra" regions of the cerebral cortex between 4 and 24 h after occlusion; this was most marked at 4 h in the penumbra region, in which a 19-fold increase above untreated control levels was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A smaller but significant induction was also detected at 4 h in the caudate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A correlation was demonstrated between the extent of COX-2 mRNA induction in cortical regions at 4 h and the severity of tissue damage subsequently detected at 24 h post MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK-801 significantly attenuated the induction of COX-2 mRNA in the penumbra region at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of COX-2 induction following experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> highlights the importance of this reaction and its products and by-products, for example, free radicals, in the tissue response to this insult </plain></SENT>
