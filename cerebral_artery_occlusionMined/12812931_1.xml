<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Qualitative measurement of regional cerebrovascular reactivity (rCVR) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) has been widely used to determine the severity of hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to validate the accuracy of qualitative assessment by using SPECT to detect reduced rCVR compared with rCVR determined quantitatively in patients with unilateral major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regional cerebral blood flow was assessed with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) at rest and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> activation in 133 patients with previously symptomatic, unilateral internal carotid or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative values were calculated by using the (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> autoradiographic method and analyzed for each cerebral hemisphere as the percentage change in rCBF between resting and activation studies (%(Hem)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative rCVR was determined for the target hemisphere distal to the occlusion as the cerebral-interhemispheric asymmetry index (AI(Hem)) and as an index of flow difference between the target cerebral and ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres (FI(Hem-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values 2 SDs below the mean in healthy volunteers were defined as decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fair agreement was observed between %(Hem) and both AI(Hem) change (resting vs activation, kappa = 0.409) and FI(Hem-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>) change (resting vs activation, kappa = 0.440) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When %(Hem) was assumed to represent the true determinant of assessing rCVR, AI(Hem) change and FI(Hem-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>) change demonstrated sensitivities of 68% and 78%; specificities, 72% and 76%; positive predictive values, 48% and 56%; false-positive incidences, 28% and 24%; and false-negative incidences, 32% and 22% for detecting patients with reduced rCVR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subgroups of patients with hemodynamic impairment cannot be accurately defined by using rCVR qualitatively measured with SPECT </plain></SENT>
