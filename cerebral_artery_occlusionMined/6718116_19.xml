<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities consisting of decreases in total, hemispheral, or regional CBF were found in 17 of 26 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven studies performed immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of state of alertness showed abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to confirming regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the method detected diffuse decrease in CBF in children with stupor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, six of seven studies obtained after exchange transfusion or during maintenance on hypertransfusion therapy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference between results in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic disturbances and those receiving transfusion therapy was statistically significant (P less than .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the 133Xe method reliably demonstrates cerebrovascular impairment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that CBF changes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> can be reversed by exchange transfusion and by hypertransfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 133Xe CBF method may be useful for following up children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> who are at high risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
