<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far only few data are available from the murine system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no data exist regarding neuroprotective effects depending on the application route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because most preclinical trials regarding restorative therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are performed in mice, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective capacities of human MSC (hMSC) in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo)-mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As systemic transplantation of MSC could provide a gentle therapeutic procedure for the (mostly elderly) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we analyzed effects of this application at a clinically relevant time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow-derived hMSCs were administered intravenously 24 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality and clinical outcome of the transplanted mice did not differ from PBS-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 and 7 days hMSC were robustly detected in lung, spleen, kidney and intestine, but not in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements revealed no differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in hMSC injected animals compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the neurogenic subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus no significant increase of endogenous cell proliferation was detected following systemic hMSC transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This data further prove the week neurogenic and neuroprotective effect and the limitations of systemically administered hMSCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
