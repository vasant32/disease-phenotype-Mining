<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> overexpressing mice and confirmed that there were no anatomical and physiological differences between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> transgenic (Tg) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we subjected mice to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> to shed light on the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> in brain ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 hr after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and volume were significantly smaller in Tg mice than in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover neurological deficit was ameliorated in Tg mice compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content, a marker of cellular protein oxidation, in Tg mice showed less increase than did that of WT mice after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, c-fos expression in Tg mice was stronger than in WT mice 1 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that transgene expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> decreased ischemic neuronal injury and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> and the redox state modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi> play a crucial role in brain damage during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
