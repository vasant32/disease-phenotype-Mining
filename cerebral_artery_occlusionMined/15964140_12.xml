<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of environmental enrichment after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on cognitive recovery and hippocampal gene expression using microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats placed in enriched environment (EE) for 1 month after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) showed significantly improved spatial memory in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> compared to rats housed alone after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis suggested several EE-induced differences in neuronal plasticity-related genes, but these changes could not be confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study highlights some of the potential problems associated with gene expression profiling of brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies at earlier time points and in additional subregions of the brain are of interest in the search for molecular mechanisms behind EE-induced neuronal plasticity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
