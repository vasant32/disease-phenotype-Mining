<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation has emerged in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> as a potential therapeutic approach in the postacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, inducible pluripotent stem (iPS) cells showed potential for multilineage differentiation and provide a resource for stem cell-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, whether iPS transplantation could improve the function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like model is still an open question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of subdural transplantation of iPS mixed with fibrin glue (iPS-FG) on cerebral ischemic rats induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an efficient method to differentiate iPS into astroglial-like and neuron-like cells which display functional electrophysiological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo study firstly showed that the direct injection of iPS into damaged areas of rat cortex significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved the motor function in rats with MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the subdural iPS-FG can also effectively reduce the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and greatly improve the behavior of rats with MCAO to perform rotarod and grasping tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, analysis of cytokine expression in iPS-FG-treated ischemic brains revealed a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that iPS cells could improve the motor function, reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, attenuate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> cytokines, and mediate neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subdural iPS-FG could be considered as a more safe approach because this method can avoid iatrogenic injury to brain parenchyma and enhance recovering from stoke-induced impairment </plain></SENT>
