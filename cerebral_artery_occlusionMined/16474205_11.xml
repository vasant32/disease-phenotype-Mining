<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cultured neurons, addition of a low concentration (under 100 microM) of zinc inhibited both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced calcium influx and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a higher concentration (over 150 microM) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">zinc decreased</z:e> neuronal viability, although calcium influx was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that zinc exhibits biphasic effects depending on its concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in cultured neurons, co-addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and CaEDTA, which binds extra-cellular zinc, increased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced calcium influx and aggravated the neurotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model, the infarction volume, which is related to the neurotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, increased rapidly on the intracerebral ventricular injection of CaEDTA 30 min prior to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that zinc released from synaptic vesicles may provide a protective effect against ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
