<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">Thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> for the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve neurologic function following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translation of these findings into clinical therapy will require careful assessment of dosing paradigms and effective time windows for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms by which TZDs protect the brain provides insight into how time windows for neuroprotection might be extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that two TZDs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at doses similar to those used clinically (1 mg/kg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and 0.1 mg/kg for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also find that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> reduces infarction volume in a transient, but not a permanent MCAO model suggesting that reperfusion plays an important role in TZD mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, both of which are exacerbated by reperfusion, we hypothesized that TZDs would be most effective if administered prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We administered TZDs 3 h after MCAO and found that infarction volume and neurologic function are significantly improved in animals reperfused at 3 h and 15 min (after TZD treatment), but not in animals reperfused at 2 h (before TZD treatment) when assessed either 24 h or 3 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While TZDs reduce intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM) expression to a similar extent regardless of the time of reperfusion, leukocyte entry into brain parenchyma is more dramatically reduced when reperfusion is delayed until after drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding that delaying reperfusion until after TZD treatment is beneficial despite a longer period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, is dramatic given the widely held view that duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the most important determinate of injury </plain></SENT>
