<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We compared the effect of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with bone marrow stromal cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats (Isch-BMSC) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (Nor-BMSC) on functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isch-BMSCs and Nor-BMSCs were intravenously injected into rats 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the mechanism of Isch-BMSC-enhanced neurorestoration, Isch-BMSC and Nor-BMSC cultures were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isch-BMSC significantly promoted functional outcome and <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp>, arterial density, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> compared with Nor-BMSC treatment animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isch-BMSCs exhibited increased Angiopoietin-1, Tie2, basic fibroblast growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and Flk1 gene expression compared with Nor-BMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using transwell coculture of BMSCs with brain-derived endothelial cells, Isch-BMSCs increased phosphorylated-Tie2 activity in brain-derived endothelial cells and enhanced brain-derived endothelial cells capillary tube formation compared with Nor-BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Tie2 gene expression in brain-derived endothelial cells using siRNA significantly attenuated BMSC-induced capillary tube formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Isch-BMSCs are superior to Nor-BMSCs for the neurorestorative treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which may be mediated by the enhanced trophic factor and angiogenic characteristics of Isch-BMSCs </plain></SENT>
