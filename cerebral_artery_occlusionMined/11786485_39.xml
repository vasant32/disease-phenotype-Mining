<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the free radical trapping agent NXY-059 in reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following both transient and permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> has been examined in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischaemia</z:e> model, rats were subjected to a 2 h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of NXY-059 (1, 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) h) for 21.75 h starting 2.25 h after the occlusion, produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (a mean 59% decrease at 10 mg kg(-1) h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> model, animals were injected (s.c.) with a loading dose of NXY-059 of 32.5, 53.8 or 75.4 mg kg(-1) and osmotic minipumps were implanted which had been primed to deliver respectively 30, 50 or 70 mg kg(-1) h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When treatment was initiated 5 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion there was a dose dependent protection of both cortical and sub-cortical tissue (cortex: 63% at the mid-range dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protection was related linearly to plasma concentration (plasma unbound NXY-059 concentration at 1 h: 37+/-16 micromol l(-1) at the mid-range dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the mid range dose was administered between 5 min - 4 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, a marked and statistically significant protection was seen at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (44% protection in cortex at 4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the substantial neuroprotective efficacy of NXY-059 at plasma concentrations that can be achieved clinically and indicate that NXY-059 also has a therapeutic window of opportunity that is clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
