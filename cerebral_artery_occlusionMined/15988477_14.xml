<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the course of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development in this lesion type for 10 weeks using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) along with histological characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced in male Wistar rats (260 to 300 g) for 60 mins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals received follow-up T1- and T2-weighted MRI from day 1 until week 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate groups of animals were analyzed histologically after 2, 6, and 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology included immunohistochemistry for neuronal and astrocytic markers as well as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> eosin and luxol fast blue-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to lesions involving the cortex, exclusively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> were characterized by a complete resolution of initially increased T1 and T2 relaxation times by 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between 2 and 10 weeks, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> as well as a dense inflammatory infiltrate were evident in these lesions, without damage to fiber tracts or development of cystic cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exclusively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> in Wistar rats are characterized by normalization of T1 and T2 relaxation times, which might, however, not be mistaken for tissue recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite this MRI normalization, selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although MRI at individual time points might therefore be ambiguous, the temporal profile of relaxation time changes over the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> time period allows discrimination of the lesion development into selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or pannecrosis </plain></SENT>
