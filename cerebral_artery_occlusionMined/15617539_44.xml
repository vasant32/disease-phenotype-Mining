<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of its favorable action profile in humans, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> is a particularly interesting candidate as a neuroprotectant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, the signaling mechanisms mediating <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>'s neuroprotective actions remained essentially uninvestigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, administered either orally for 9 wk as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylactic (4 mg/kg/day) or intraperitoneally immediately after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (4 mg/kg), on the activation of signal transduction pathways in mice submitted to 90 min of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 24 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these studies, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly reduced ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by approximately 30-35%, as compared with animals receiving diluent (sham) treatment, independent of whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> was administered prior to or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under both conditions, animals receiving <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> exhibited elevated phosphorylated Akt levels in their brains, as determined by Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, phosphorylation levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/-2 and Jun kinase (JNK)-1/-2 were increased following prophylactic, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-3 kinase/Akt signaling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection, while ERK-1/-2 and/or JNK-1/-2 rather appear to be involved in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>'s long-term effects </plain></SENT>
