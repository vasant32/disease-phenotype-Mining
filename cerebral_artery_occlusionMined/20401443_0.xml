<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on inflammatory cells accumulation after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NDGA (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min, 2, 24, 48 h after reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain injuries were observed by neurological and histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endogenous IgG exudation, neutrophils and macrophages/microglia accumulation, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein expression were determined by immunohistochemistry 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The catalysates of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> (CysLTs), were evaluated by ELISA 3 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that NDGA ameliorated neurological dysfunction, decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and inhibited endogenous IgG exudation, neutrophils infiltration, ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NDGA reduced the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> and CysLTs 3 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, NDGA did not reduce the accumulation of macrophages/microglia 72 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NDGA decreases neutrophil infiltration in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> via inhibiting 5-LOX activation </plain></SENT>
