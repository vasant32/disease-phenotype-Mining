<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A simple classification instrument based on imaging that predicts outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that the Boston <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Imaging Scale (BASIS) classification instrument effectively predicts patient outcomes and is superior to the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) in predicting outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 230 prospectively screened, consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 87 had noncontrast CT (NCCT)/CT angiography (CTA), and 118 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) at admission and were classified as having major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by BASIS criteria if they had a proximal cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or, if no occlusion, imaging evidence of significant parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the others were classified as minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, length of hospitalization, and discharge disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BASIS was compared with ASPECTS (dichotomized &gt; or &lt;or=7) in 87 patients who had NCCT/CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BASIS classification by NCCT/CTA was equivalent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging/MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six of 205 patients were classified as having major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 71.4% and 15.4% of major and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors, respectively, were discharged to a rehabilitation facility, whereas 14.3% and 79.2% of patients with major and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were discharged to home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean length of hospitalization was 12.3 and 3.3 days for the major and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 87 NCCT/CTA patients, BASIS and ASPECTS agreed in 22 major and 44 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BASIS classified 21 patients as having major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> who were classified as having minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by ASPECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The BASIS major/ASPECTS minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group had outcomes similar to those classified as major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by both instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The BASIS classification instrument is effective and appears superior to ASPECTS in predicting outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
