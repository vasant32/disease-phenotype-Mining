<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early arterial recanalization can lead to dramatic recovery (DR) during intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether this clinical recovery is sustained 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied consecutive patients treated with intravenous tPA (0.9 mg/kg within 3 hours) who had M1 or proximal M2 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on pretreatment transcranial Doppler according to previously validated criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were continuously monitored for 2 hours after tPA bolus to determine complete, partial, or no early recanalization with the Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neurologist obtained the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores independently of transcranial Doppler results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DR was defined as a total NIHSS score of 0 to 3 points, and early recovery (ER) was defined improvement by &gt; or =10 points at 2 hours after tPA bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good long-term outcome was defined as an NIHSS score of 0 to 2 or an mRS score of 0 to 1 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients with proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had a median prebolus NIHSS score of 16 (range, 6 to 28; 90% with &gt; or =10 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tPA bolus was given at 130+/-32 minutes (median, 120 minutes; 57% treated within the first 2 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DR+ER was observed in 50% of patients with early complete recanalization (n=18), 17% with partial recanalization (n=18), and 0% with no early recanalization (n=18) (P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, DR+ER was observed in 12 patients (22%), and 9 (75%) had good outcome at 3 months in terms of NIHSS (P=0.009) and mRS (P=0.006) scores compared with non-DR and non-ER patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If early recanalization was complete, 50% of these patients had good outcome at 3 months, and 78% with DR+ER sustained early clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If recanalization was partial, 44% had good long-term outcome, and 66% of patients with DR+ER sustained the benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If no early recanalization occurred, 22% had good long-term outcome despite the lack of DR within 2 hours of tPA bolus (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 11%, 11%, and 39% in patients with complete, partial, and no early recanalization, respectively (P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reasons for not sustaining DR in patients with early recanalization were subsequent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DR or ER after recanalization within 2 hours after tPA bolus was sustained at 3 months in most patients (75%) in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complete or partial early recanalization leads to better outcome at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients achieve good long-term outcome without early recanalization </plain></SENT>
