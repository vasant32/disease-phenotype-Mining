<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether CD36 participates in the molecular events underlying the inflammatory reaction that accompanies <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may contribute to the tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, a transcription factor that coordinates postischemic gene expression, is attenuated in CD36-null mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infiltration of neutrophils and the glial reaction induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with an inhibitor of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, an enzyme that contributes to the tissue damage, reduced ischemic brain injury in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, but not in CD36 nulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the molecular and cellular inflammatory changes induced by intracerebroventricular injection of interleukin-1beta were not attenuated in CD36-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings unveil a novel role of CD36 in early molecular events leading to nuclear factor-kappaB activation and postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of CD36 signaling may be a valuable therapeutic approach to counteract the deleterious effects of postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
