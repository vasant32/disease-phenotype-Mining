<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to investigate the activation pattern of different MAPKs [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38] after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using a model for transient (2 h) and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were allowed 6 h to 1 week of survival before immunohistochemical evaluation with phospho-specific antibodies, recognizing activated MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ERK was activated in ipsilateral blood vessels, neurons and glia, but also in contralateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>JNK activation was absent in neurons but appeared in arterial blood vessels and glia at the lesion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Active p38 was observed in macrophages in maturing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ERK and JNK may participate in the angiogenic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERK, but not JNK, was activated in neurons, possibly indicating a pathophysiologic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Active p38 might be involved in the inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
