<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PtdCho homeostasis is regulated by the balance between hydrolysis and synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PtdCho is hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), PtdChospecific phospholipase C (PtdCho-PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PtdCho synthesis is rate-limited by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36700">phosphocholine</z:chebi> cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which makes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final step of PtdCho synthesis is catalyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi>:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PtdCho synthesis in the brain is predominantly through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) significantly increased PLA2 activity, secretory PLA2 (sPLA2)-IIA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, PtdCho-PLC activity, and PLD2 protein expression following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> treatment significantly attenuated PLA2 activity, sPLA2-IIA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, and PtdCho-PLC activity, but did not affect PLD2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>tMCAO also resulted in loss of CCT activity and CCTalpha protein, which were partially restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in cytosolic PLA2 or calcium-independent PLA2 tMCAO. protein levels after Up-regulation of PLA2, PtdCho-PLC, and PLD and regulation of CCT collectively down-resulted in loss of PtdCho, which was significantly restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> treatment significantly attenuated the infarction volume by 55 +/- 5% after 1 h of tMCAO and 1 day of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> significantly restores <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">Ptd</z:chebi>-Cho levels by differentially affecting sPLA2-IIA, PtdCho-PLC, and CCTalpha after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
