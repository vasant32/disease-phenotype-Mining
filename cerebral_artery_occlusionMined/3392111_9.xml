<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat was induced by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The temporal evolution of regional energy metabolism was studied over the 14 days consequent to the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and occipital cortices as well as in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), phosphocreatine, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and, in addition, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the cerebral/plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio (C/P) were measured in the hemispheres both ipsilateral and contralateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the biochemical changes were severe in the striatum and moderate in cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later on (at 24 and 48 h), an overall aggravated metabolic status was noted while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> declined and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These latter biochemical changes likely indicate a marked inhibition of the rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 48 h, the energy reserves (ATP, phosphocreatine) of parietal cortex no longer equaled those of other cortical regions, but abruptly fell to the levels found in the striatum without any increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, at 7 and 14 days, the levels of the various metabolites in most cortical regions returned toward control values, although signs of a depressed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in both striatum and parietal cortex, ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations, although higher than those observed at 48 h, remained significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our present biochemical study permits the classification of these selected brain regions into three categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First there are those that are outside the area of infarction: the frontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These regions show little temporal evolution of brain energy metabolism but, notwithstanding, they are regions in which <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> use would appear to be greatly depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Second is a region considered to be the focus of infarction: the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The caudate-putamen is a region with early and profound metabolic disturbances with no final restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Last is the region of metabolic penumbra--the parietal cortex, in which there is a time-related exacerbation of the consequences of middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusion</z:e> in the rat </plain></SENT>
