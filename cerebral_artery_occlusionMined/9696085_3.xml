<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etomidate, a carboxylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> derivative, is a nonbarbiturate <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> that is used clinically both as an <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> and as a neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect etomidate has on collateral cerebral vessels is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our studies was to test whether etomidate selectively augmented cerebral blood flow (CBF) to CDT during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as an additional mechanism of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A left craniotomy was performed in each of 14 dogs, with the animals under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A branch of the middle cerebral artery was occluded and cannulated distally for determination of CDT using a "shadow flow" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF and vascular pressures were measured and used to calculate vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An etomidate infusion (0.1 mg/kg of body weight/min administered intravenously) was started, and CBF and vascular pressures were measured at 10 and 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> was then induced, and CBF and pressures were again measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CBF was significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain, including CDT, when etomidate was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CDT showed a 53.7% reduction in flow, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF was reduced by at least 63.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, blood flow to CDT was reduced by an additional 42.7%, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrum was reduced by at least 22.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular resistance was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels during etomidate infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of etomidate do not seem to be through the augmentation of collateral or global CBF </plain></SENT>
