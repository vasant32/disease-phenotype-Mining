<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the effects of the recently available group II <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (+)-2-Aminobicyclo[3.1.0]<z:chebi fb="17" ids="29021">hexane</z:chebi>-2-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35692">dicarboxylic acid</z:chebi> (LY354740) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>)-induced excitotoxic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as well as on hypoxic-ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At concentrations shown to be selective for group II mGluRs expressed in cell lines (0.1-100 nM), LY354740 did not attenuate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-mediated neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro or in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LY354740 did not attenuate oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro or ischemic infarction after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the neuroprotective effect of another group II <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, (S)-4-carboxy-3-phenylglycine (4C3HPG), which has shown injury attenuating effects both in vitro and in vivo, was not blocked by the group II <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (2 S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU), (RS)-alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-sulphonophenylglycine (MSPG), or the group III <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (S)-alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-3-carboxyphenylalanine (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="50099">MCPA</z:chebi>), suggesting that this neuroprotection may be mediated by other effects such as upon group I mGluRs </plain></SENT>
