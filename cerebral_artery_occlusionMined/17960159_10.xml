<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is upregulated during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and regulates gene expression by binding to a cis-acting <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-responsive element (HRE), we therefore used a novel HRE, originating in the 3'-end of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, to control gene expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A concatemer of nine copies (H9) of the consensus sequence of HRE was used to mediate <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of adult CD-1 mice received AAVH9-VEGF, AAVH9-lacZ or saline injection, and then underwent 45 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results show that HIF-1 was persistently expressed in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF was overexpressed in the ischemic perifocal region in AAVH9-VEGF-transduced mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-labeled immunostaining showed that VEGF expressed in neurons and astrocytes but not endothelial cells, suggesting that adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors transduced neurons and astrocytes predominantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of microvessels/enlarged microvessels was greatly increased in the AAVH9-VEGF-transduced mice (180+/-29/27+/-4) compared to the AAVH9-lacZ (118+/-19/14+/-3) or saline-treated (119+/-20/14+/-2) mice after tMCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation examination demonstrated that these microvessels were newly formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow recovery in the AAVH9-VEGF-transduced mice was also better than in AAVH9-lacZ or saline-treated mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that HRE is a novel trigger for the control of VEGF expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VEGF overexpression through AAVH9-VEGF gene transfer showed stable focal angiogenic effects in post-ischemic repair process, providing an opportunity to rebuild injured brain tissue </plain></SENT>
