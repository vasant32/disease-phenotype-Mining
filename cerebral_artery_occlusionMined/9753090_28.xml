<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One week after cell implantation in the striatum, animals were subjected to 30 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Striatal damage was evaluated at the cellular level after 48 h of recirculation using immunocytochemical and stereological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic insult caused an extensive degeneration of projection neurons, immunoreactive for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 3': 5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 kilodaltons (DARPP-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> autoradiography demonstrated surviving grafted cells in the lesioned striatum in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transplanted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of striatal projection neurons was significantly reduced (by an average of 45%) in animals with NGF-secreting grafts, whereas control cells, not producing NGF, had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective action of NGF-secreting grafts was also observed when the total number of striatal neurons immunopositive for the neuronal marker NeuN was quantified, as well as in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings indicate that administration of NGF by ex vivo gene transfer and grafting of neural stem cells can ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of striatal projection neurons caused by transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
