<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of the free radical spin-trap alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-butyl-tert-nitrone (alpha-PBN) in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was examined in two series of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first, rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and treated 1 h after occlusion with a single dose of alpha-PBN (100 mg/kg) or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was measured and controlled for the first 24 h to obtain identical temperature curves in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined on histological sections 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>alpha-PBN did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (control: 28.3+/-16.3 mm3 vs. alpha-PBN 23.7+/-7.4 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments, periinfarct depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) were recorded with an extracellular DC electrode at two locations in the ischemic penumbra for the initial 3 h following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>alpha-PBN (100 mg/kg, single dose in conjunction with occlusion) significantly reduced the total number (median value of 3 PIDs in the control groups vs. 1 PID in alpha-PBN groups, p&lt;0.001) and total duration of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> (median value 662 s in the control groups vs. 162 s in the alpha-PBN groups, p&lt;0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes determined 7 days later in the same rats were not smaller in alpha-PBN-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study thus demonstrates that attenuation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> does not always lead to smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> if permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> is followed by long survival time and does not support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> per se are critical determinants of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this situation </plain></SENT>
