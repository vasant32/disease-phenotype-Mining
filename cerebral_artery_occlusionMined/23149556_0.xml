<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> enhances long-term brain repair and improves behavioral recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (total 0.6 μg) was administered intravenously 6, 12, and 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed behavioral outcome during a 30-day follow-up and animals were perfused for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro specific binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> to microglia increased after pro-inflammatory stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> was associated with increased migration of doublecortin-positive cells in the striatum toward the ischemic lesion 72 hours after MCAO, and reactive microglia expressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor 1 (SUR1) and Kir6.2 in the medial striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One month after MCAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> was also associated with increased number of NeuN-positive and 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine-positive neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>-treated MCAO rats showed improved performance in the limb-placing test on postoperative days 22 to 29, and in the cylinder and water-maze test on postoperative day 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blockade of SUR1 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> enhanced long-term brain repair in MCAO rats, which was associated with improved behavioral outcome.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 14 November 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.166 </plain></SENT>
