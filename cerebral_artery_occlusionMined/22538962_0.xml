<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis (LA) is a common finding among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and has been associated with poor post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes but its association with ILAO remains poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to clarify the contribution of baseline LA and other common risk factors to 90-day outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation ILAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,153 consecutive patients with imaging-confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during a 4-year period (2007-2010) at a single academic institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final study cohort included 87 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ILAO subjected to multimodal CT imaging within 24 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA severity was assessed using the van Swieten scale on non-contrast CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptomeningeal collaterals were graded using CT angiogram source images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) was determined on follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression controlling for HT, treatment modality, demographic, as well as baseline clinical and imaging characteristics was used to identify independent predictors of a poor outcome (90-day mRS &gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) at baseline was 15 (interquartile range 9-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four percent of the studied patients had severe LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.028), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.015), poor collaterals (p &lt; 0.001), higher baseline NIHSS (p = 0.003), higher mRS at 90 days (p &lt; 0.001), and were older (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe LA had a uniformly poor outcome (p &lt; 0.001) irrespective of treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was independently associated with higher baseline NIHSS (p &lt; 0.001), worse LA (graded and dichotomized, p &lt; 0.001), reduced leptomeningeal collaterals (graded and dichotomized, p &lt; 0.001), presence of HT (p &lt; 0.001), presence of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> (p = 0.01), baseline mRS (p = 0.002), and older age (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The association between severe LA (p = 0.0056; OR 13.86; 95% CI 1.94-âˆž) and baseline NIHSS (p = 0.0001; OR 5.11; 95% CI 2.07-14.49 for each 10-point increase) with poor outcome maintained after adjustment for confounders in the final regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this model, there was no significant association between presence of HT and poor outcome (p = 0.0572) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coexisting LA may predict poor functional outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation ILAO independent of other known important outcome predictors such as comorbid state, admission functional deficit, collateral status, hemorrhagic conversion, and treatment modality </plain></SENT>
