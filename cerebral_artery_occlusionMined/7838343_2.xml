<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We carried out a time course study of cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity using a modified microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve cats were divided into two groups; six were the reperfusion injury models, and six were cold injury models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the reperfusion injury model, dialysates were collected during 60 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at 300 minutes during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cold injury model, dialysates were collected 240 minutes after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow on the injured side decreased during occlusion in the reperfusion injury model and 60 minutes after injury in the cold injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the reperfusion model, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity, as determined with electron spin resonance, increased in the first 30 minutes and decreased 300 and 330 minutes after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the dialysate, albumin increased 180 minutes after cold injury, which may show the progress of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in water content was observed on the injured side of both models, and a correlation between water content and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity was found in the reperfusion injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By this technique, a method of detecting the alteration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity in the extracellular space of the brain was established </plain></SENT>
