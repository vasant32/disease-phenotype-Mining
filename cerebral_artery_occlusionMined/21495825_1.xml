<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> noted during such interventions pose a difficult challenge to neurointerventionists and are often sequestered as treatment failures and deemed inappropriate for intraarterial recanalization efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case in which aggressive intervention was performed despite evidence of contrast extravasation on preintervention angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This 37-year-old woman presented with an occlusion of the M(1) segment of the left middle cerebral artery and a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She received intravenous tPA without improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed M(1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> as well as active contrast extravasation without arterial displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thromboaspiration was performed in light of her known <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with excellent recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate postprocedure imaging demonstrated a large insular <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and emergent craniectomy and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> evacuation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 4 months' follow-up, the patient was living at home, was ambulating, and had excellent comprehension with mild expressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is little peer-reviewed data in the literature to aid in the decision-making process when contrast extravasation is recognized at the time of preinterevention angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuation of mechanical endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> intervention, in light of active contrast extravasation, may be warranted in young patients with major deficits and absence of arterial displacement or delayed global filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further thrombolytics are not advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In select <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, continuation of a planned attempt at mechanical recanalization without the further use of thrombolytics may be warranted in light of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
