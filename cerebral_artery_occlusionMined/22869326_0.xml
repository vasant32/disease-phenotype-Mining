<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor, G protein-coupled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (GPER, previously named GPR30), is widely distributed throughout the male and female brain and, thus, could potentially play a role in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotective effects in diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that GPER distribution and expression in the brain of male, intact female, and ovariectomized (OVX) mice is increased after 0.5 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion increased GPER distribution in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> brain regions of male mice, but surprisingly not in intact females or OVX mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar differences were observed in the male and female human brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GPER distribution was decreased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GPER immunofluorescence was co-localized with the endothelial cell marker, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, and the neuronal marker, NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the immunohistochemical findings, Western blot analysis showed GPER expression is only elevated in the ischemic hemisphere of male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, GPER <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in males was elevated at 4 h but had returned to baseline by 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings indicate that GPER may be a potential therapeutic target after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in males, in whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy is not feasible </plain></SENT>
