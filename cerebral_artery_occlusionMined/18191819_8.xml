<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to examine the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcohol consumption on transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups, a control group and an alcohol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks after being fed a liquid diet with or without alcohol, responses of parietal pial arterioles to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> were measured using a cranial window technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments, rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h under ketamine/xylazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored through a Laser-Doppler flow probe attached to the lateral aspect of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation and ischemic lesion were assessed 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilation of pial arterioles in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was significantly reduced in alcohol-fed rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alcohol-fed rats had significantly larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and worse neurological outcomes than non-alcohol-fed rats under ketamine/xylazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, rCBF measurement indicated that alcohol-fed rats had less regulatory rebound increase in rCBF after the initial drop in rCBF at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcohol consumption exacerbates transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased ischemic brain damage during alcohol consumption may be related to an impaired cerebral vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
