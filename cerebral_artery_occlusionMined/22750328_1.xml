<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linking adaptive and innate immunity dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic factor G-CSF is able to modulate DC-mediated immune processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although G-CSF is under investigation for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, only limited information exists about its effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the impact of G-CSF on cerebral DC migration and maturation as well as on the mediated immune response in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in rats by means of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR were performed of the ischemic brain and flow cytometrical analysis of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF led to a reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and an improved neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed a reduced migration of DCs and mature antigen-presenting cells after G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the untreated tMCAO group, G-CSF led to an inhibited DC activation and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was shown by a significantly decreased cerebral transcription of TLR2 and the DC maturation markers, CD83 and CD86, as well as by an inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced increase in immunocompetent DCs (OX62⁺OX6⁺) in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was reduced, indicating an attenuation of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest an induction of DC migration and maturation under ischemic conditions and identify DCs as a potential target to modulate postischemic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Suppression of both enhanced DC migration and maturation might contribute to the neuroprotective action of G-CSF in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
