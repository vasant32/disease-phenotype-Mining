<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought to investigate effects of local and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> permeability of small molecules and compare these to effects of direct injury to the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Evans blue was used to determine the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) following local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, injury to the L5 spinal nerve or transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, three compounds having low, medium and high brain permeability (atenolol, <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi>, respectively) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following model establishment (4-hr post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3435">carrageenan</z:chebi>, 24-hr post-FCA, 2-, 4- and 24-hr post-LPS, 21 days post-nerve injury) compounds were administered and 30 min later the brain, spinal cord and blood removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma and tissue concentrations of compounds were quantified by LC/MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Localized <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> did not affect Evans blue penetration into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> but significantly increased <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> penetration into the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> increased the quantity of Evans blue in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> but also decreased the penetration of atenolol, <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> into the brain 4-hr post-insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nerve injury had no effect on Evans blue or compound penetration, while middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a large but short lived increase in Evans blue penetration into both the cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may affect the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> penetration of some compounds but is unlikely to lead to a large non-selective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, it is appropriate to test for side-effects, and conduct brain pharmacokinetic determinations, in na√Øve rats </plain></SENT>
