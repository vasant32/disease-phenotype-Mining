<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogranin (NG) is a brain-specific postsynaptic kinase C (PKC) substrate and calmodulin-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of RA-NG interaction on ischemic brain injuries are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of exogenous RA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the involvement of NG after distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (dMCAO), and the mechanism of RA neuroprotection in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal cortical infarction was developed in the dMCAO model, followed by intraperitoneal treatment with either vehicle or RA; then the rats were evaluated with neurological deficit scores according to a beam-walking test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume was analyzed in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE)-stained sections; NG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level was measured with a real-time PCR; and NG protein expression was determined immunohistochemically at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after dMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RA-treated rats showed a significant improvement in functional deficits and a significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after dMCAO, compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RA group showed an increase in NG protein or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, compared with the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, administration of RA decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and promoted neurological functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotective effect is attributed, at least in part, to NG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and NG protein expression </plain></SENT>
