<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Enhancing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis is a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has been shown to have both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis effects in animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But aFGF can not enter the brain freely after system administration due to the filtration of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration of aFGF as a noninvasive method can bypass the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and enter the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system directly without systemic adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate the therapeutic effects of intranasally delivered aFGF, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and intranasally administrated with aFGF or saline starting at 24 hours and once daily for the subsequent 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BrdU (50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected daily for 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A modified neurological severity scores test was performed before and at 1, 7, 14 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect BrdU immunoreactive cells and BrdU / DCX double labeled cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microvessels were labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and the numbers, length and diameters of vessels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intranasal aFGF did not significantly reduce the lesion size, but did improve neurological functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subventricular zone and the striatum, numbers of BrdU immunoreactive cells were significantly increased in aFGF group at day 14, and the majority of BrdU positive cells were co-labeled with DCX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the percentage of BrdU positive endothelial cells around the ischemic lesions were significantly increased in aFGF group, compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> perfusing vessels revealed a significant increase of vessels in the boundary regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rats treated with aFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But there were no significant differences concerning the length and the diameter of the vessels between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In summary, aFGF may enhance neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration of aFGF may be a feasible approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
