<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current routine clinical techniques, including angiography and perfusional single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography, can be used to indicate problems in cerebral vascular supply and areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but cannot distinguish between ischaemic core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to image specifically the penumbra, a method or indicator should be able to define areas with reduced blood flow, and a degree of metabolic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, the tissue could be regarded as hypoxic rather than ischaemic, and we have therefore chosen to investigate the potential of radio-labelled hypoxic markers in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to combine a hypoxic marker with a blood flow marker we used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99mTc-HMPAO) and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-125 iodoazomycin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (125I-IAZA), during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>99mTc-HMPAO and 125I-IAZA were injected simultaneously 2 h following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and 5 h before decapitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paired autoradiograms were produced and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three distinct patterns emerged from the autoradiograms: slightly decreased perfusion with no uptake of the hypoxic marker indicating an area of misery perfusion; moderately decreased perfusion with concomitant uptake of iodoazomycin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, a region of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>; and severely decreased perfusion with no retention of the hypoxic tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we present a new use for an imaging agent in the investigation of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This agent, IAZA together with HMPAO, provides a means of separating the penumbra into regions of misery perfusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of this may be important in the clinical investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
