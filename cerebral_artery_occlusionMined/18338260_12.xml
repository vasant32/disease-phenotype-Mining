<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we observed a cascade of events involving the three proteases during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded and reperfused at various time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a maximal increase in the levels of calpains during 1h and 12 h after reperfusion than permanently occluded rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, these levels were reduced by 1st and 3rd day of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly the cathepsin-b levels were significantly increased during 1h and 12 h, of reperfusion, followed by activation of caspase-3 which reached maximal levels by 1st and 3rd day of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequential activation of calpains, cathepsin-b and cleaved caspase-3 is evident by the Western blot analysis which was further confirmed by the cleavage of substrates like PSD-95 and spectrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in the regional distribution and elevation of these proteases at different reperfusion time periods indicates that differential mode of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occur in the brain during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat model </plain></SENT>
