<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed to evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) reduction by constructing <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps with a color scale to localize <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> change in transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human CuZn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (Wt) mice during 1 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 1 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
