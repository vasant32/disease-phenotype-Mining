<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to study the effect of the inflammatory reaction on brain ischemic injury, we observed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, number and distribution of CD3-, CD8-, ED1- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ED2</z:e>-positive cells systematically in the caudate-putamen of rats in a MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four types of inflammatory cells first infiltrated the ischemic penumbra and then migrated into the center of the ischemic area, but the morphological changes and infiltration processes differed significantly; the infiltration of CD3- and CD8-positive cells into the ischemic area started at 3 days postischemia, and their number peaked at 1 week; however, although ED1- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ED2</z:e>-positive cells were also observed at 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, they reached their maximum number at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ED1-and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ED2</z:e>-positive cells showed evident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that the response of CD3-, CD8-, ED1- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ED2</z:e>-positive cells in the ischemic area and the pathological changes in ischemic brain tissue could be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the infiltration and reaction of inflammatory cells are involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
