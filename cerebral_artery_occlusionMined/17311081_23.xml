<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male animals display greater sensitivity to ischemic injury than do their female counterparts; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study determined if the potent and nonaromatizable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16330">dihydrotestosterone</z:chebi> (DHT), exacerbates ischemic damage in the male rat and alters postischemic gene expression after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 22 h reperfusion, removal of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> by castration provided protection from ischemic injury in both cortex and striatum (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) histology), whereas DHT replacement (50 mg subcutaneous implant) restored infarction volume to that of the intact male; <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (50 mg) had similar but less potent effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We utilized microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify genes differentially expressed at 6 h reperfusion in periinfarct cortex from castrated rats with or without DHT replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identify, for the first time, a number of gene candidates that are induced by DHT with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, many of which could account for cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, dysregulation of blood-brain barrier and the extracellular matrix, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and ionic imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> are important mediators of ischemic damage in male brain and that transcriptional mechanisms should be considered as we seek to understand innate male sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
