<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the correlation between plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as a marker of oxidative DNA damage, and progressive brain damage in rats subjected to transient or permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent- and 0.5-, 1-, 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At various times thereafter, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, 8-OHdG levels in plasma and brain tissue, DNA fragmentation, and immunohistochemical observations on their brains were recorded and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12 h after 2-h MCAO-reperfusion, the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was increased; it peaked at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA degeneration expanded from the caudate putamen into the cortical region at 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>8-OHdG-containing cells in the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone were observed at 12 h, the number of 8-OHdG-positive cells was highest at 24 h and they co-localized with DNA single-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma 8-OHdG significantly increased at 12 h, and peaked at 24 h after reperfusion (1.1+/-0.7 ng/ml (mean+/-S.D.); controls 0.3+/-0.1; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase was in step with increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, DNA degradation, and reflected immunohistochemical findings in the cortical region but not the caudate putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO model, plasma 8-OHdG levels were associated with the brain contents of 8-OHdG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma 8-OHdG and the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were lower in the 0.5- and 1-h than the 2-h MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that 8-OHdG as a peripheral biomarker may be an indicator of oxidative brain damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
