<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was permanently occluded in 66 adult Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were randomly divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 Group I rats, TRH in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was administered initially as a 2-mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/hr for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 20 Group II rats, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was administered initially as a 2-mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 2-mg/kg/hr for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 26 Group III rats, physiological saline was administered as an initial 0.5-cc bolus followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 cc/hr for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> solutions were given in volumes of 0.5 cc for the bolus and 0.5 cc/hr for continuous infusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infusions were begun within 10 minutes of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after treatment, the rats underwent a careful neurological examination and were then sacrificed immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological grade of the rats correlated with the size of infarcted areas among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades, irrespective of treatment (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> nor TRH improved neurological function or reduced the size of infarction compared to saline-treated control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TRH caused a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure during infusion, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neither TRH nor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> are effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
