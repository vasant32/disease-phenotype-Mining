<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The potential of thrombolytic agents to improve outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> could be negated if recanalization of an occluded artery exacerbates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether infarctions associated with reperfusion have more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> than those without reperfusion and whether the time course for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> varied with and without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 24 hours after permanent and 1, 2, and 3 hours of temporary right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric volume, water, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were measured 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after permanent and 3 hours of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and also determined 24 hours after permanent and 2 and 3 hours of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Minimal tissue damage occurred after 1 hour of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> sizes were similar after permanent and 3 hours of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and significantly greater than after 2 hours of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric volume, water, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> from the infarcted right hemisphere were significantly greater than those from the left hemisphere beginning 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and continuing for 48 hours, with a peak at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right hemispheric water measured 24 hours after 2 hours of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was significantly less than after permanent or 3 hours of temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and is independent of reperfusion status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> will not occur after thrombolytic treatment or spontaneous recanalization of occluded cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
