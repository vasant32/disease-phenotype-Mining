<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the penumbra can be saved by early reperfusion, in the rat it is consistently affected by selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mapping selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the living primate would be desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five young adult baboons underwent (15)O <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography for cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen consumption, and oxygen extraction fraction mapping at baseline and serially during and after 20-hour temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At approximately day 30, (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ), a potential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography marker of selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>, and structural magnetic resonance-based <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mapping were obtained, and the brain was perfused-fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced FMZ binding in noninfarcted cortical middle cerebral artery areas was searched voxel-wise, and specific binding was assessed using compartmental modeling of FMZ time-activity curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual inspection revealed reduced late FMZ uptake in the affected cortical territory, extending well beyond the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the incidence of selected voxels was greater than chance, documenting mildly but significantly reduced FMZ uptake and specific binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial (15)O <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography revealed moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathology documented only mild neuronal changes in or near the affected areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We document moderate but definite late FMZ binding decrements in noninfarcted cortical areas in the baboon, consistent with previous rat and human studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These were acutely characterized by moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion, consistent with neuronal damage from ischemic or reperfusion injury in the salvaged at-risk tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only mild histopathological changes subtended these FMZ alterations suggesting subtle processes such as isolated dendrite or synapse loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether these changes impact on clinical outcome deserves studying because they may be targeted by specific neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
