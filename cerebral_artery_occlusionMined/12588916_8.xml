<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The astroglial protein S100B is a marker of cerebral tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether the serum kinetic of S100B may serve as a surrogate marker of successful clot lysis and early recanalisation (&lt;6 hours) in hyperacute proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/M1) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors prospectively included 23 patients (mean (SD) age, 70.2 (11.0) years) presenting with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/M1 occlusion on magnetic resonance angiography (n=18), intra-arterial angiography (IA; n=2), or transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD; n=3) within five hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of recanalisation and their point of time were determined using TCD or IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual S100B values were determined at hospital admission, every eight hours within the first three days, and at 12 hour intervals from day 4 to day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the S100B area under the curve (AUC) and the S100B peak value were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early recanalisation (&lt;6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, n=7) was associated with a significantly lower mean S100B AUC compared with no recanalisation (22.2 (40.1) versus 406.8 (284.4) micro g/l per hour; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using receiver operating calculations, a single S100B value obtained 48-96 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of less than 0.4 micro g/l (cut off point) provided a 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity for sufficient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/M1 clot lysis &lt;6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy for a single S100B value obtained in the 48-96 hours time window was as high as for the AUC (95.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single S100B value &lt;0.4 micro g/l obtained 48-96 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> indicates successful clot lysis &lt;6 hours in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/M1 occlusion with a high degree of accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, determination of a single S100B value may serve as a surrogate marker of early and sufficient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/M1 recanalisation in large scale thrombolytic studies </plain></SENT>
