<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effort has been facilitated by significant progress in replicating the behavioral and neuropathological changes of authentic human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using relevant animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> mimics several motor abnormalities seen in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we have utilized this model to investigate treatment strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study explored the potential benefits of neural transplantation of fetal rat striatal cells or human neurons derived from a clonal embryonal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line to correct the abnormalities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced behavioral dysfunctions were ameliorated by the neural grafts as early as 1 month post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, transplantation of human neurons induced a significantly more robust recovery than fetal rat striatal grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the logistical and ethical concerns about the use of fetal striatal cells for transplantation therapy can be eliminated by exploiting cell line-derived human neurons as alternative graft sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of human neurons has a therapeutic potential for treatment of behavioral deficits associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
