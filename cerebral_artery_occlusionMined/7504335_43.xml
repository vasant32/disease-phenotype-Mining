<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed on 24 male Wistar rats by extracranial insertion of a 4-0 nylon monofilament into the internal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three additional rats were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 3 per time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat brains were perfused with buffer, frozen, sectioned, and stained with a monoclonal antibody against endothelial NOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjacent sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for evaluation of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The endothelial NOS in the cerebral vessels was upregulated at 1 hour after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> throughout the ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of the endothelial NOS progressively increased up to 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the periphery of the area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the cortex, a delayed (24-hour) upregulation of the endothelial NOS remained constant throughout the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and intense differential expression of the endothelial NOS in the core and peripheral areas of the lesion indicates a role for endothelial NOS in ischemic cell damage and suggests that the increased expression of NOS may mediate changes in the cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
