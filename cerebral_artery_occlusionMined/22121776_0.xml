<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study is to observe the effect of ilexonin A (IA) on the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43), and neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion in rats and explore its possible mechanism of protecting neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Models of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were established in SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after two hours <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, IA (20 and 40 mg x kg(-1)) was injected immediately and on 3, 7, 14, and 28 d once a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological severity was evaluated by neurological severity scores (NSS); neuronal injury in the boundary zone of the infarction area was evaluated by TUNEL and Niss1 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of bFGF and GAP-43 and neurogenesis were evaluated by Western blotting and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) fluorescence staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with IA, the NSS of treatment groups were lower than that of the models (3 and 7 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL positive neurons decreased and Nissl positive neurons increased at the same time (3 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of bFGF and GAP-43 increased significantly in the boundary zone of the infarction area when compared to model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IA markedly enhanced the neurogenesis in the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, which revealed an increase of Brdu/NeuN positive cells in the boundary zone of the infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanism of protecting neuronal injury of IA may be related to inhibition on neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, upregulation of bFGF and GAP-43, and neurogenesis in boundary zone of infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
