<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microvascular perfusion defects may accompany sustained occlusion and subsequent reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery; however, the nature of such "no-reflow" defects remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the absence of antithrombotic pretreatment, we documented lenticulostriatal microvascular flow integrity following 3-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 1-hour reperfusion in a baboon occlusion/reperfusion model by two methods identifying 1) microvascular occlusion and 2) microvascular patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microvascular "no-reflow" involved capillaries (vessels of 4.0-7.5 microns diameter) of the lenticulostriatal territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capillary reflow included 27-39% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> capaillaries in two subjects, indicating a significant reduction of perfusion from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (2p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In identical experimental preparations, single polymorphonuclear leukocytes completely occluded 4.7% of microvessels of capillary diameter in randomly selected fields, partially occluded 3.5% of postcapillary venules, and occluded 40% (four of 10) of capillaries in linear reconstruction along a 110 microns length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circumferential contact between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> endothelial cell membranes was documented, with an intrecellular gap of, at most, 160 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrin was found with degranulated platelets when the latter were associated with granulocytes, but not with polymorphonuclear leukocytes alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding of capillary-obstructing polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the microvascular bed following middle cerebral artery reperfusion in focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in this model satisfies an essential requirement for postulating their role in early microvascular injury and the "no-reflow" phenomenon </plain></SENT>
