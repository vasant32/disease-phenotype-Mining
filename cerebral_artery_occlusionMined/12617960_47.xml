<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess the distribution of microglia/macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using bone marrow chimera mice known to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), many round-shaped EGFP-positive cells migrated to the ischemic core and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48-72 h after MCAO, irregular round- or oval-shaped EGFP/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba 1)-positive cells increased in the transition zone, while many amoeboid-shaped or large-cell-body EGFP/Iba 1-positive cells were increased in number in the innermost area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 days after MCAO, many process-bearing ramified shaped EGFP/Iba 1-positive cells were detected in the transition to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, while phagocytic cells were distributed in the transition to the core area of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of these morphologically variable EGFP/Iba 1-positive cells was similar up to 14 days from MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study directly showed the migration and distribution of bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages and the relationship between resident microglia and infiltrated hematogenous element in ischemic mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is important to study the distribution of intrinsic and extrinsic microglia/macrophage in ischemic brain, since such findings may allow the design of appropriate gene-delivery system using exogenous microglia/macrophages to the ischemic brain area </plain></SENT>
