<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the lateral parietal region, with variable involvement of the frontoparietal parasagittal sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 3 days after occlusion, massive terminal degeneration but no neuronal changes were apparent in the ipsilateral thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 1 week after occlusion, abnormal neurons with darkly stained, shrunken nuclei and atrophic perikarya were present in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neurons were densely argyrophilic in Fink-Heimer sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats with small lateral parietal cortical lesions had degenerating neurons limited to the medial ventroposteromedial nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large lesions involving the parasagittal sensorimotor cortex resulted in widespread neuronal damage in the ventroposteromedial, ventroposterolateral, intralaminar, and posterior nuclear regions but nowhere else </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity to laminin antibody decreased, and astrocytic proliferation was abundant in affected thalamic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> due to thalamocortical fiber damage in ischemic cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such lesions remote from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may influence functional recovery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
