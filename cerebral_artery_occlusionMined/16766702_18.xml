<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe recent findings on the regulation of neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in particular regarding the duration of the neurogenic response and the influence of age, as well as the molecular mechanisms influencing migration and survival of the new neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also discuss some crucial issues that need to be addressed in the further exploration of this potential self-repair mechanism after damage to the adult brain </plain></SENT>
