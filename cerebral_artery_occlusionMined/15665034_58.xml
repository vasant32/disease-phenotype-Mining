<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of clinical and experimental evidence suggest an important role of the renin-angiotensin system in ischemic brain injury although the cellular regulation of the angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors and their potential relevance in this condition have not yet been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first assessed the regulation of brain AT1 and AT2 receptors in response to transient unilateral medial cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AT2 receptors in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone were significantly upregulated 2 days after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased AT2 receptors, which were abundantly distributed in a large number of brain regions adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area including cerebral frontal cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, were exclusively expressed in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, AT1 receptors, which remained unaltered, were mainly expressed in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neurons of ischemic striatum, increased AT2 receptors were associated with intense neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blockade of central AT2 receptors with PD123177 abolished the neuroprotective effects of central AT1 receptor blockade with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">irbesartan</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In primary cortical neurons, stimulation of AT2 receptors supported neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that cerebral AT2 receptors exert neuroprotective actions in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal injury, possibly by supporting neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth in peri-ischemic brain areas </plain></SENT>
