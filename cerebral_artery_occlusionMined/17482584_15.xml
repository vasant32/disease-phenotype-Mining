<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, fasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, was reported to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo by increasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is uncertain whether a ROCK inhibitor can directly protect neurons against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate both the involvement of ROCK activity in ischemic neuronal damage and any direct neuroprotective effect of fasudil against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vivo, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice, and the resulting infarction was evaluated 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROCK expression and activity were assessed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the effects of fasudil and hydroxyfasudil (a main metabolite of fasudil) were examined on oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-induced PC12 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity in primary cerebral neuronal culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ROCK expression and activity increased in the striatum, especially in axons, in the early phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasudil reduced this ROCK activity and protected against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyfasudil inhibited OGD-induced PC12 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and fasudil and hydroxyfasudil each attenuated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that ROCK plays a pivotal role in the mechanism underlying ischemic neuronal damage and that a direct effect of fasudil on neurons may be partly responsible for its protective effects against such damage </plain></SENT>
