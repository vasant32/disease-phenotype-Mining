<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many new candidate pharmaceuticals designed to improve recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been proposed recently, but there are still too few molecular imaging methods capable to assess their efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of the inflammatory reaction that follows focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is overexpression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> peripheral <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor/18 kDa translocator protein (PBR/TSPO) in the monocytic lineage and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This overexpression can be imaged with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) using PBR/TSPO-selective radioligands such as [(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Here, we tested whether PET with [(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 would evidence the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, a broad spectrum antibiotic presently tested as neuroprotective agent after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, on the inflammatory reaction induced in an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Ten rats were subjected to a 2-h transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> or saline was intravenously administrated 1 h after reperfusion and daily during the following 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET studies were performed using [(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 at 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vivo PET imaging showed a significant decrease in [(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 uptake at 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> with respect to saline-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> treatment had no effect on the size of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> administered daily during 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> decreases [(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 binding, suggesting that the drug exerts an anti-inflammatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>[(18)F]<z:chebi fb="14" ids="39867,4640,53488">DPA</z:chebi>-714 PET is a useful biomarker to study novel anti-inflammatory strategies in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
