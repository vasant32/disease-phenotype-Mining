<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Following the massive increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> activity that occurs in cerebral cortex when local blood flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> below 8--11 ml/100 g/min, recovery of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels might be expected when flow is restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the reversibility of such <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> increases, produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 13 baboons anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose, in relation to a wide range of ischaemic duration and density and post-occlusion flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> was measured with ion-exchanger microelectrodes and flow by hydrogen clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The artery was occluded for 136 +/- 63 min (mean +/- SD) and measurements were continued thereafter for 93 +/- 57 min without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon reperfusion, partial or complete recovery (i.e., to within control confidence limits) of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, but the rate of recovery varied widely and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> clearance showed bi-compartmental characteristics in 7 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fast component (or initial slope) rate constant was significantly correlated with post-occlusion flow and (inversely) with the duration of occlusion for which flow fell below the arbitrary threshold of 10 ml/100 g/min (the flow deficit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slow component was unrelated to these quantities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery was associated with a significantly higher post-occlusion flow, and smaller flow deficit, than was partial recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary increases in <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, associated with relatively high flow deficits and post-occlusion flows, were seen in 5 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in terms of factors that may determine <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> clearance and the possibility that elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (demonstrated here to be prolonged well into the post-occlusion phase) might influence the evolution of a cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
