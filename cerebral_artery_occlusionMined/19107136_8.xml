<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a large fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-generated neuroblasts die shortly after being born, in part, because of local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we primed E-selectin-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) by repetitive intranasal administration of recombinant E-selectin to target local secretion of immunomodulating, antiinflammatory cytokines to activating blood vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E-selectin-tolerized SHRs had decreased infarction volumes, and increased numbers of Tregs in the cervical lymph nodes and ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain Tregs were distributed primarily in periinfarct regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E-selectin tolerization did not alter cellular proliferation in the ipsilateral SVZ after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor on vascular niche blood vessels was suppressed and both doublecortin protein levels and the number of newly generated neuroblasts or neurons were increased in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This enhanced survival of neural progenitor cells and neurons was paralleled by improved functional performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that E-selectin-specific Tregs can modulate the efficacy of neurogenesis after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and promote repair after brain injury </plain></SENT>
