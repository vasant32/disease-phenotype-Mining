<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that intermittent normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (HO) results in ischemic tolerance to reduce ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this research, we attempted to see changes the expression of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors I and II (mGluR I and II) following intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into two experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group was exposed to 95% inspired HO for 4 h/day for 6 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second group acted as control, and was exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each main group was subdivided to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO-operated) and intact (without any surgery) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours from pretreatment, MCAO-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (IV) were measured in MCAO-operated subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of mGluR I and II and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels of core, penumbra and subcortex regions were assessed in sham-operated and intact subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with intermittent HO decreased NDS and IV, increased GSH levels in subcortex, and upregulated mGluRs I and II significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance, the intermittent HO seems to partly exert their effects via upregulation of mGluR I and II </plain></SENT>
