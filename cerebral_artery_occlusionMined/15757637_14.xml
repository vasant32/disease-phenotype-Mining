<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the potency and efficacy of a non-feminizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, 2-(1-adamantyl)-4-methylestrone (ZYC-26), with its parent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi>, and an expected non-neuroprotective 3-O-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> analog of (17beta)-2-(1-adamantyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (ZYC-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These estratriene derivatives were tested for their ability to protect in an in vitro <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation model, to neuroprotect against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in cell culture models, to bind the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta), to elicit uterotrophic effects, and to affect brain damage from transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that in contrast to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi>, neither ZYC-26 nor ZYC-23 bound to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (ER) and both failed to elicit a uterotrophic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> analogue ZYC-26 was more potent that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in its ability to inhibit <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and to protect HT-22 cells from either <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or iodoacetic acid (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>) toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, ZYC-26 was as active in preventing brain damage from transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) as was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies suggest that the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity, rather than ER binding of non-feminizing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> such as ZYC-26, mediates their potent neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, in view of the now known toxicities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> feminizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use in older women, non-feminizing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> may be a useful alternative for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced brain protection </plain></SENT>
