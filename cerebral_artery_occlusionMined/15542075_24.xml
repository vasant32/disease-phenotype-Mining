<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of the free radical scavenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume due to permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice and, if so, to elucidate the mechanism of its neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Balb/c mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were treated with 3.0 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> or vehicle 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) method after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in situ detection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral neocortex was carried out using the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-sensitive dye dihydroethidium (DHE) staining technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 3.0 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> ameliorated the tissue damage in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim and significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to about 77% of the control (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative measurement of red fluorescence emitted from DHE revealed that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> increased in the ischemic core at 1 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and extended towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim at 3 and 6 h, and that pretreatment with 3.0 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the increase of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim at 3 and 6 h (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double staining with DHE and monoclonal antibody against NeuN showed that the majority of the nuclei positive for DHE were also positive for NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> salvages the boundary zone of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by scavenging reactive oxygen species especially in the neurons during permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
