<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is a robust neuroprotectant, and the results of prospective clinical trials have indicated that it may improve neurological outcome in certain instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One aspect of this protection has been associated with the prevention of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption because they can degrade the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors explored the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and MMPs and whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> preservation resulting from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> therapy is due to alterations in MMP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours; the animals were maintained in a state of normothermia or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals' brains were collected 2, 6, and 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 24 hours to assess the extent of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with prior reports, areas of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption detected on T1-weighted images were smaller in the brains of rats maintained in a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (normothermia group 8.6 +/- 3% of the brain; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group 0.2 +/-0.1% of the brain; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 at the transcriptional and translational levels was reduced in hypothermic brains at 6 hours and 24 hours after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-9 was primarily localized to cells of monocytic origin but was also observed in neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-2 was found in some neurons and astrocytes but not in inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> increased the levels of the endogenous MMP inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> attenuates <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, decreases MMP expression, and suppresses MMP activity </plain></SENT>
