<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans usually afflicts the elderly, most experimental studies on the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have used young animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that the upregulation and/or persistence of amyloidogenic proteins is exacerbated in aged rats after cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we studied the expression of ssAPP and its proteolytic product Ass in the brains of young and old rats 7 days after temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by reversible occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in 3- and 20-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 week, brains were removed and immunostaining was performed for ssAPP, Ass, and ED1 for macrophages and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological staining revealed that the degree of necrotic cavitation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core was relatively less in aged rats than in young rats, suggesting a slower pace of degenerative change and/or tissue removal in older animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ssAPP immunoreactivity was robustly increased, primarily in macrophage-like, ED1-positive cells in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and in the penumbra of both young and aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ass immunoreactivity was evident in GFAP-positive astrocytic somata and processes, and also in clusters of small spherical structures in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These Ass-immunoreactive minispheres were more numerous in aged rats than in young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ssAPP and Ass immunoreactivity in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and penumbra indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> promotes conditions that are favorable to the focal accumulation of ssAPP and its proteolytic fragments, especially in the aged brain </plain></SENT>
