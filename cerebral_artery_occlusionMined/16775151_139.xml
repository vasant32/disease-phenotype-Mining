<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that the adult mammalian brain has the capacity to regenerate some neurons after various insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism of insult-induced neurogenesis has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, GFAP-expressing cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles include a neurogenic cell population that gives rise to olfactory bulb neurons only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report evidence that, after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, these cells are capable of producing new neurons outside the olfactory bulbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SVZ GFAP-expressing cells labeled by a cell-type-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> method were found to generate neuroblasts that migrated toward the injured striatum after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These neuroblasts in the striatum formed elongated chain-like cell aggregates similar to those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SVZ, and these chains were observed to be closely associated with thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, long-term tracing of the green fluorescent-labeled cells with a Cre-loxP system revealed that the SVZ-derived neuroblasts differentiated into mature neurons in the striatum, in which they expressed neuronal-specific nuclear protein and formed synapses with neighboring striatal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the role of the SVZ in neuronal regeneration after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its potential as an important therapeutic target for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
