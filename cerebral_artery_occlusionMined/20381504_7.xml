<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of ICA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SIRT1 is a class III <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha) which stimulates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate the expression of SIRT1 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha during ICA's neuroprotection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, behavioral test, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and brain water content were evaluated on middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) mouse models treated by ICA/saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, primary cortical neurons were tortured by OGD in the presence of ICA or SIRT1 inhibitor III or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell viability and mortality were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and flow cytometer assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown efficiency of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha siRNA was measured by real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expressions of SIRT1 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In result, neurological scores, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly improved, the cortical expressions of SIRT1 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha were higher with ICA compared to the control (P &lt; 0.05), and reversed by SIRT1 inhibitor III/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ICA protects against brain ischemic injury by increasing the SIRT1 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1alpha expression, potentially to be a neuroprotectant for ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
