<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor (mAChR) binding can be a viable muscarinic neuronal marker which provides therapeutic information different from perfusional information in global brain, we evaluated the discrepancy between the distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF), mAChR and its five subtypes of messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n=9) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n=8) phases of a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model and in sham-operated controls (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, regional CBF was markedly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, whereas mAChR was not reduced and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was reduced only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, mAChR was reduced markedly in the infarcted lesion and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mAChR was slightly reduced in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and pontine nucleus because of remote effects; however, regional CBF in the substantia nigra was slightly increased and did not change in the pontine nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between CBF and mAChR was clarified, and the tendency toward a reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic region without a reduction in mAChR suggested the presence of cholinergic neurons which were viable but hypometabolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that mAChR imaging may be of value for the assessment of the viable cholinergic neuron density in vivo </plain></SENT>
