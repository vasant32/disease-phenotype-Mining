<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reversibility of DWI abnormalities is transient following brief temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and to characterize the temporal evolution of in vivo ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight rats were subjected to 30 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and underwent diffusion-, perfusion-, and T2-weighted MRI during occlusion; immediately after reperfusion; 30, 60, and 90 minutes after reperfusion; and 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCav) values and the cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) ratio were calculated in both the lateral caudoputamen and overlying cortex at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The size of the in vivo ischemic abnormalities was calculated from the ADCav and the T2 maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was used to verify ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the CBFi ratio and ADCav values declined significantly in the two regions during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBFi ratio recovered immediately after reperfusion and remained unchanged over 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, ADCav values returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 60 to 90 minutes and secondarily decreased at 12 hours after reperfusion as compared with those in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of the in vivo ischemic lesions maximized at 48 hours and was highly correlated with TTC-derived lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> recovery of initial ADCav-defined lesions after reperfusion is transient, and secondary ADCav-defined lesions develop in a slow and delayed fashion </plain></SENT>
