<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-ischemic effects were seen in both animals receiving BNG-1 before the ischemic insult as well as in animals receiving the drug formulation after surgical occlusion of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-thrombic activity was seen in vitro to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation and in vivo to prolong <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BNG-1 was also found to inhibit several phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms with potency order of the following rank: PDE 1 &gt; PDE 3 &gt; PDE 6 &gt; PDE 2 &gt; PDE 4 &gt; PDE 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other pre-clinical results and emerging clinical data coupled with the present findings suggest that BNG-1 may be a safe and effective therapy for both the prevention and treatment of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the fundamental cellular mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects may result from phosphodiesterase inhibition </plain></SENT>
