<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion results in substantially smaller cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion if reperfusion is initiated within the first few hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only little information is available on the long-term functional outcome of the cortical regions "salvaged" by early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue we examined basic electrophysiologic parameters in vitro using standard extracellular recording techniques at 7 and 28 days after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (1- and 2-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both neocortical areas ipsi- and contralateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were systematically mapped to delineate the extent of periinfarct and remote alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the periinfarct region we found a significant reduction of field potential amplitudes up to 3 mm when measuring from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border at 7 days and up to 7 mm at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paired-pulse inhibition, an indicator of GABAergic transmission, was only moderately impaired in this region at 7 days and not significantly different from control at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remote effects were observed both ipsi- and contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ipsilaterally they were restricted to a region close to the midline (presumably motor cortex) and were most likely attributable to the degeneration of corticostriatal connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of the contralateral excitability changes was clearly related to the size of the neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> resulting in the widespread reduction of field potential amplitudes and an impairment of paired-pulse inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show that there is a relatively large periinfarct region with decreased overall excitability after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion which is likely to have a profound effect on perilesional processes involved in functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Remote excitability changes may contribute to the functional deficit and are probably related to deafferentation </plain></SENT>
