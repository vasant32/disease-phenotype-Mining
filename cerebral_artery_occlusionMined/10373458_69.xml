<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identify a novel MG-arginine adduct and also characterize the structure of a major fluorescent adduct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we describe the immunochemical study on the MG-arginine adducts using monoclonal antibody directed to MG-modified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon incubation of Nalpha-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> with MG at 37 degrees C, two nonfluorescent products and one fluorescent product were detected as the major products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nonfluorescent products were identified as the Ndelta-(5-hydro-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15729">L-ornithine</z:chebi> derivatives (5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone) and a novel MG-arginine adduct having a tetrahydropyrimidine moiety (Ndelta-(4-carboxy-4,6-dimethyl-5, 6-dihydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-2-yl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15729">L-ornithine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the following chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the major fluorescent product, putatively identified as Ndelta-(5-methylimidazolon-2-yl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15729">L-ornithine</z:chebi> (5-methylimidazolone), was found to be identical to Ndelta-(5-hydroxy-4, 6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-yl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15729">L-ornithine</z:chebi> (argpyrimidine): (i) the low and high resolution fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry gave a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25364">molecular ion</z:chebi> peak at m/z of 297 (M+H) and a molecular formula of C10H25O6N4, respectively, which coincided with argpyrimidine; (ii) the 1H NMR spectrum of this product in d6-Me2SO showed a singlet at 2.10 ppm corresponding to six protons; (iii) the peak corresponding to the 5-methylimidazolone derivative was not detected by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with the mode of selected ion monitoring; (iv) incubation of 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone, a putative precursor of 5-methylimidazolone, at 37 degrees C for 14 days scarcely generated 5-methylimidazolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, as an immunochemical approach to the detection of these MG adducts, we raised the monoclonal antibodies (mAb3C and mAb6B) directed to the MG-modified protein and found that they specifically recognized the major fluorescent product, argpyrimidine, as the dominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical analysis of the kidneys from diabetic patients revealed the localization of argpyrimidine in intima and media of small artery walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the accumulation of argpyrimidine was also observed in some arterial walls of the rat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that argpyrimidine may contribute to the progression of not only long term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but also the tissue injury caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
