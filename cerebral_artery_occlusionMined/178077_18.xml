<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cortical fluorescence and reflected light signals were recorded from the central <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory by means of a beam-splitting fluorometer, and a fluorescence signal corrected for alterations in intravascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, there was a rapid increase in cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence, peaking within 30 to 70 seconds at 20% to 40% of full scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was followed by a slow linear decline in fluorescence over the next several minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behavior of cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence was unaffected by replacement of the ambient air over the cortical surface with nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean regional blood flow values in the most ischemic gyri two to 15 minutes following <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were 21% to 23% of the corresponding values in the opposite, nonischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
