<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6) receptor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R) is one of the most recently cloned <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> receptors, and it plays important roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the other <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> receptors, the cellular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R are poorly elucidated relative to its significance in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R interacts with Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed a physical interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R and Jab1 using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase pulldown, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocyto(histo)chemistry assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The manipulation of Jab1 expression using Jab1 small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R-mediated activity and cell membrane expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R, whereas overexpression of Jab1 produced no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated that the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R induced the translocation of Jab1 into the nucleus and increased c-Jun phosphorylation and the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R and Jab1 were up-regulated in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-induced focal cerebral ischemic rats and in cultured cells exposed to hypoxic insults, suggesting possible protective roles for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R and Jab1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Jab1 provides a novel signal transduction pathway for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R and may play an important role in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(6)R-mediated behavior changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
