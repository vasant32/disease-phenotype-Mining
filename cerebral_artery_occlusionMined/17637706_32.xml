<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several hypotheses to account for these therapeutic effects have been suggested, current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> is that both neuroprotection and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> are primarily responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the effects of hMSCs and angiopoietin-1 gene-modified hMSCs (Ang-hMSCs) intravenously infused into rats 6 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and histologic analyses revealed that rats receiving hMSCs or Ang-hMSCs exhibited comparable reduction in gross lesion volume as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although both cell types indeed improved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> near the border of the ischemic lesions, neovascularization and regional cerebral blood flow were greater in some border areas in Ang-hMSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both hMSC- and Ang-hMSC-treated rats showed greater improved functional recovery in the treadmill stress test than did control rats, but the Ang-hMSC group was greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the intravenous administration of genetically modified hMSCs to express angiopoietin has a similar effect on reducing lesion volume as hMSCs, but the Ang-hMSC group showed enhanced regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>increased angiogenesis</z:mp> at the lesion border, and modest additional improvement in functional outcome </plain></SENT>
