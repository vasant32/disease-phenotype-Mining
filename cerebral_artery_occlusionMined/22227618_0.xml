<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A super-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous fluctuations were recorded using a series of gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) images before and 30 min, 60 min, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After preprocessing, serial fMRI data were obtained by fast Fourier transformation to calculate the ALFFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical parametric mapping software was used for the statistical analysis of ALFFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted images and diffusion weighted images (DWI) were also performed to detect the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signal intensities of abnormal ALFFs increased and migrated from the core of the ischemic lesion areas to the edge of lesion following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dynamic changes in the ALFF maps demonstrated that the sizes of the ALFF regions exceeded beyond the borderline of the DWI lesions during the super-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the ALFFs maps between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> group and the control group (P&lt;0.005; cluster size&gt;10 voxels), which mainly occurred in the periphery of the ischemic region in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ALFF maps provide hemodynamic BOLD information on neural activity, and have potential for predicting survival and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic brain tissues </plain></SENT>
