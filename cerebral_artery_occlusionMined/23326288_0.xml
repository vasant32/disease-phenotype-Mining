<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that eNOS produces NO, which exerts a protective effect, while iNOS produces NO with neurotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> preserves neuronal cells against from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> and investigated the levels of three NOS isoforms in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were immediately treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, i.v.) after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains tissues were collected at 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of these three isoforms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> were analyzed using Western blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">Ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral cortex against MCAO injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of eNOS decreased in MCAO-operated animals, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> treatment attenuated the MCAO-induced decrease of eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, iNOS and nNOS expression levels increased during MCAO, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> prevented injury-induced increase of these isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings suggest that the up- and down modulation of three isoforms by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17620">ferulic acid</z:chebi> is associated with a neuroprotective mechanism </plain></SENT>
