<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether AGR and URE influenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced neuronal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, we examined the effect of AGR and URE on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the striatum, cortex and hippocampus, and on the impaired learning and memory in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and radial eight-arm maze in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h, rats were administered saline, AGR or URE (100 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for three weeks, followed by their training to the tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the water maze test, the animals were trained to find a platform in a fixed position during 6 days and then received a 60-s probe trial in which the platform was removed from the pool on the 7th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the radial eight-arm maze, animals were tested six times per week for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats with ischemic insults showed impaired learning and memory on the tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with AGR and URE produced a significant improvement in escape latency to find the platform in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and in the number of choice errors in the radial arm maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with behavioral data, pretreatments with AGR and URE significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampal CA1 area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that AGR and URE have a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and learning and memory damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that AGR and URE may be useful in the treatment of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
