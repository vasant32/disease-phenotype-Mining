<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied the potential neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>, compared with the awake state, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following 2 h of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and 22 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, intubated, and mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood gases, and pH were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was maintained at 37.5-38 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were assigned to one of four groups according to the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> type (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>) and the duration of anaesthesia: "short-duration", during the preparation only; "long-duration", during both preparation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAo, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were visualized by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two additional groups of rats were subjected to the same protocol as that of long-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and long-duration <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> with additional pericranial temperature measurements made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physiological parameters were comparable between the groups but MAP was higher (P&lt;0.0001) in the short-duration groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the short-duration groups, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anaesthetics</z:chebi> (short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>: 288 (61) mm(3), mean (SD); short-duration <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>: 269 (71) mm(3), P&gt;0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the awake state (short-duration groups), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (long-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>: 199 (54) mm(3), P&lt;0.0047 vs short-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>; long-duration <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>: 121 (55) mm(3), P&lt;0.0001 vs short-duration <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the long-duration <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> group was significantly lower than that in the long-duration <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> group (P&lt;0.0053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pericranial temperatures were similar in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> long-duration groups (P&gt;0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was greater than that conferred by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
