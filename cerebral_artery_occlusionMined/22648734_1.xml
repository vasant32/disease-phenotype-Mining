<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neuronal damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is a serious risk to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and apoptotic damage play an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (Edv) maintains <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in brain, improves the cholinergic dysfunction and suppresses the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> response in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) of 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Edv was administered (10 mg/kg bwt) intraperitoneally 30 min before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 1 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, rats were tested for neurobehavioral activities and were sacrificed for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, estimation of oxidative damage markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Edv treatment significantly reduced ischemic lesion volume, improved neurological deficits, contended oxidative loads, and suppressed apoptotic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with Edv ameliorated the neurological and histological outcomes with elevated endogenous anti-oxidants status as well as reduced induction of apoptotic responses in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluded rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We theorized that Edv is among the pharmacological agents that reduce free radicals and its associated cholinergic dysfunction and apoptotic damage and have been found to limit the extent of brain damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
