<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 24-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were infused with ICAM-1 antisense or control oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (48 nmol/d ICV) or vehicle, starting 24 hours before MCAO and continuing until the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 protein knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was quantified by the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure was recorded by laser Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue penetration of antisense was confirmed by the use of fluorescent ODNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transient MCAO upregulated ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the ipsilateral cortex between 3 and 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 antisense infusion prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced ICAM-1 protein expression and reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by 53%; P&lt;0.05; 226+/-35 mm3 in control ODN group and 104+/-27 mm3 in antisense ODN group; n=8 each) and mean neurological deficit score (by 44%; P&lt;0.05; 2.4 in control ODN group and 1.3 in antisense ODN group; n=8 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither control nor antisense ODN had any effect on mean arterial blood pressure and the physiological parameters monitored during MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with noninfused control, intracerebroventricular infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid or antisense or sense ODN had no significant effect on the regional cerebral blood flow changes that accompanied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased ICAM-1 expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> since ICAM-1 protein knockdown decreased ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which ICAM-1 inhibition offers neuroprotection is independent of blood pressure modulation </plain></SENT>
