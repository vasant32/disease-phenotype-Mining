<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific aim was to assess the intra-carotid infusion route for bone marrow-derived macrophage delivery at reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen Sprague-Dawley rats sustained 1 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>USPIO-labeled bone marrow-derived macrophages were slowly injected for 5 min immediately after reperfusion in ischemic animals (n = 7), 1 h after the end of surgery in sham animals (n = 5) and very shortly after anesthesia in healthy animals (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiparametric MRI was performed at day 0, just after cell administration, and repeated at day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analysis included <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> for iron detection and rat endothelial cell antigen-1 for endothelium visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-carotid cell delivery brought a large number of cells to the ipsilateral hemisphere of the brain, as seen on both MRI and immunohistology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was associated with high mortality (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of sham animals demonstrated that intra-carotid cell delivery could induce ischemic lesions and may thus favor additional brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study highlights severe drawbacks to the intra-carotid delivery of macrophages at the time of reperfusion in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiparametric MRI appears to be a method of choice to monitor longitudinally the effects of cell infusion, allowing the assessment of both cell fate with the help of magnetic labeling and of potential tissue damage </plain></SENT>
