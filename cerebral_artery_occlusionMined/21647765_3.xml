<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to further define the preclinical characteristics of Rd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that Rd passes the intact blood-brain barrier and exerts protection in both transient and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the dose-response study, Rd (10-50 mg/Kg) significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This protection was associated with an improved neurological outcome for as many as 6 weeks after transient MCAO, as assessed by modified neurological severity score, modified sticky-tape test, and corner test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison, Rd was significantly more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> and slightly more effective than N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the therapeutic window study, Rd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection, even when administered for as many as 4 h after the recirculation of transient MCAO or after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in female rats or 16-month-old male rats, the salutary effects of Rd were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest Rd is a promising neuroprotectant and provide support for future clinical studies to confirm whether Rd is beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
