<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> 1.5% in air/oxygen, and mechanically ventilated to a PaCO2 of 4.5 kPa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an intraluminal filament, rats were given, in random order, either <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> 1 mg kg-1 min-1 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> 3% (both of which have been shown to reliably produce EEG burst suppression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a further 30 min, reperfusion was induced by withdrawing the filament </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group showed a 21% reduction in mean hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
