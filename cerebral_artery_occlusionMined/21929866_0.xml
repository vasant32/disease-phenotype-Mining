<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, effective cells within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> MNC population and their modes of action are still under discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MNCs and MNC fractions enriched (CD34(+)) or depleted (CD34(-)) for CD34-expressing stem/progenitor cells were isolated from hUCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were transplanted intravenously following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in spontaneously hypertensive rats and directly or indirectly cocultivated with hippocampal slices previously subjected to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of saline solution or a human T-cell line served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, MNCs, CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells reduced neurofunctional deficits and diminished lesion volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNCs were superior to other fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, human cells could not be identified in brain tissue 29 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following direct application on postischemic hippocampal slices, MNCs reduced neural damage throughout a 3-day observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) cells provided transient protection for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CD34(-) fraction, in contrast to in vivo results, failed to reduce neural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Direct cocultivation of MNCs was superior to indirect cocultivation of equal cell numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Indirect application of up to 10-fold MNC concentrations enhanced neuroprotection to a level comparable to direct cocultivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After direct application, MNCs migrated into the slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of migrated cells revealed that the CD34(+) cells within MNCs were preferably attracted by damaged hippocampal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that MNCs provide the most prominent neuroprotective effect, with CD34(+) cells seeming to be particularly involved in the protective action of MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) cells preferentially home to neural tissue in vitro, but are not superior concerning the overall effect, implying that there is another, still undiscovered, protective cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MNCs did not survive in the ischemic brain for longer periods without immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
