<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (M-SHRSP) develop severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at early ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that ingestion of green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> prevents cerebral ischemic damage in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, in association with increased plasma epigallocatechin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> intake decreases the incidence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in M-SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Male M-SHRSP ingested 0.5% green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> extract (Polyphenon E) in their drinking water beginning at 5 weeks of age, and blood pressure, heart rate, and locomotor activity were continuously monitored from 8 weeks using a telemetry system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was assessed by the appearance of neurologic symptoms, body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and circadian rhythm disturbances in heart rate, blood pressure, and locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> ingestion significantly delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by 10 days compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there was no difference in blood pressure at 10 weeks, the rate of in blood pressure increase in the tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> group was significantly smaller than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16301">NO2-</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3-</z:chebi> concentrations increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both groups without significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> concentration significantly decreased at post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with that of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous ingestion of green tea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> from an early age prevented the development of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in M-SHRSP, probably by inhibiting the further development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> at later ages </plain></SENT>
