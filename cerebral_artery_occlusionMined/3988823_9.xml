<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local CBF (LCBF) was assessed at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as at the end of 4 h of recirculation by the microsphere technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local CMRgl (LCMRgl) was measured at the end of the recirculation period with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histology was evaluated by light microscopy from coronal brain blocks adjacent to those used for the determination of LCBF and LCMRgl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When LCBF in the central and peripheral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories during the recovery period was between 40 and 115% of the value in sham occlusion studies, LCMRgl was greater than the control level found in the sham studies, and was accompanied by slight histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that anaerobic glycolysis may persist after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in spite of the recovery of LCBF to a level that is normally greater than the threshold for the activation of anaerobic glycolysis (less than 40% of the control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persistent anaerobic glycolysis in the reperfusion period following an ischemic insult may be a sign of early tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of the regions in the peripheral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory with LCBF between 40 and 110% of the levels during the recovery period in the sham studies showed a mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in LCMRgl so that the flow-metabolism ratio remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These regions did not exhibit histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This possible protective mechanism of the tissue in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is discussed from the standpoint of the relationship between flow and metabolism </plain></SENT>
