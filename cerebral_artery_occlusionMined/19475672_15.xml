<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can activate endogenous reparative processes, such as proliferation of endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these new cells die shortly after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine a novel strategy for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 1 week after injury by enhancing the survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced endogenous NPCs in SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult rats were subjected to a 90-minutes middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats from days 6 to 9 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Locomotor behavior was measured using an activity chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation of endogenous NPCs were examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PFT-alpha enhanced functional recovery as assessed by a significant increase in multiple behavioral measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed PFT-alpha treatment had no effect on the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> processes in the lesioned cortical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it enhanced the survival of SVZ progenitor cells, and promoted their proliferation and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PFT-alpha inhibited the expression of a p53-dependent proapoptotic gene, termed PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>), within the SVZ of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of survival/proliferation of NPCs was further found in SVZ neurospheres in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PFT-alpha dose-dependently increased the number and size of new neurosphere formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Delayed treatment with a p53 inhibitor PFT-alpha is able to modify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced endogenous neurogenesis and improve the functional recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
