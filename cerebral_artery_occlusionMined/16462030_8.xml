<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to provide a pharmacological basis for the neuroprotective actions of the enhanced accumulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in mulberry leaves (ML) against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vitro and in vivo, a process was developed to enhance the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in mulberry leaves (GAML) as a result of the various anaerobic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> concentrations were changed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi> gas purging, the reaction temperature, reaction time, pH and the leaf size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> enhanced the potential of neuroprotection in the PC12 cells damaged by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GAML reduced the cytotoxicity in the PC12 cells against oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced cerebral ischemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of GAML was further demonstrated in vivo using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> brain injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GAML significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the brain compared with than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results suggest that the anaerobic treatment of ML makes GAML enhance the neuroprotection effect against in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> such as in vitro </plain></SENT>
