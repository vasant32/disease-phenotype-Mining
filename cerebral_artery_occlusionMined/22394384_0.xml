<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral cortical neurons have a high vulnerability to the harmful effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the brain has the ability to detect and accommodate to hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, known as preconditioning, is a natural adaptive process highly preserved among species whereby exposure to sub-lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> promotes the acquisition of tolerance to a subsequent lethal hypoxic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytokine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-like weak inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (TWEAK) and its receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are found in neurons and their expression is induced by exposure to sub-lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in this work we tested the hypothesis that the interaction between TWEAK and Fn14 induces tolerance to lethal hypoxic and ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here we used in vitro and in vivo models of hypoxic and ischemic preconditioning, an animal model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and mice and neurons genetically deficient in TWEAK, Fn14, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-α) to investigate whether treatment with recombinant TWEAK or an increase in the expression of endogenous TWEAK renders neurons tolerant to lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study the effect of TWEAK on the expression of neuronal TNF-α, Western blot analysis to investigate whether the effect of TWEAK was mediated by activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases and immunohistochemical techniques and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to study the effect of TWEAK on apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that either treatment with recombinant TWEAK or an increase in the expression of TWEAK and Fn14 induce hypoxic and ischemic tolerance in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This protective effect is mediated by neuronal TNF-α and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 pathway via phosphorylation and inactivation of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> promoter protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicate that the interaction between TWEAK and Fn14 triggers the activation of a cell signaling pathway that results in the induction of tolerance to lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that TWEAK may be a potential therapeutic strategy to protect the brain from the devastating effects of an ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
