<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the ability of fetal cells to survive at the edge of the central core of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three groups of 8 adult Sprague-Dawley rats, fetal cortical cells from ED 16 were stereotactically transplanted at 3 h, 24 h, and 7 days after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 rats, fetal cells were transplanted by using the same coordinates, without <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic groups, overall graft survival was 85%, and in the control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grafts survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft survival was determined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the survival of grafts transplanted at different intervals after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that fetal cortical cells can survive in cerebral tissue undergoing severe ischemic change </plain></SENT>
