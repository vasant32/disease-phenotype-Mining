<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and reliable method of quantifying tissue damage is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method, based on atomic absorption spectroscopic determinations of Na, K, and Ca concentrations in <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> samples, was applied to the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site by 24 hours, Na concentration more than doubled, Ca concentration increased by greater than 70%, and K concentration fell nearly 80%; these changes are consistent with a greater than 80% disruption of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A remarkable acceleration of ionic shifts occurred between 4 and 6 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 hours, only 20-30% of the ionic shifts found at 24 hours had occurred; by 6 hours, 80-100% of the ionic shifts found at 24 hours had taken place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the measurements reflect ionic movement into and out of the tissue, they are likely to represent irreversible tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although blood brain barrier breakdown may have contributed to an increased rate of ionic shifts, large ionic gradients must have been present between the extracellular space and the vascular compartment at 4-6 hours to drive the ionic shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest an upper time limit of 4 hours for treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic tissue damage in the rat MCAo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The methods and analytical approach described may be useful for determining the time window for therapeutic intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> injuries, as well as for evaluating treatment effects </plain></SENT>
