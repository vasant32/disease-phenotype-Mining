<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed at 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and fusion protein <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> 1 (Opa1) were both upregulated in the ischemic penumbra, with the peak at 2 days after tMCAO, whereas phosphorylated-Drp1 (P-Drp1) progressively increased with a peak at 14 days after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence analysis showed many Drp1/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase subunit l (COX1) double-positive cells and Opa1/COX1 double-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra and also showed some double-positive cells with Drp1/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Opa1/TUNEL in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both Drp1 and Opa1 showed progressive decreases until 2 days after tMCAO in the ischemic core because of necrotic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that there was a continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fission and fusion during these periods in the ischemic penumbra after tMCAO, probably in an effort toward mitophagy and cellular survival </plain></SENT>
