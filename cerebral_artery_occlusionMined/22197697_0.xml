<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because opening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (MPTP) is a crucial determinant of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of IPost may be associated with inhibition of MPTP opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part 1 of this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 90 min, followed by reperfusion for 72 h, were assigned to receive one of the following treatments: three cycles of IPost (15s each), intracerebroventricular injection of saline (control), administration of the MPTP inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) (2 μmol/L, 15 μL) or its vehicle alcohol, administration of the MPTP opener atractyloside (Atr) (2 mmol/L, 15 μL), or IPost plus CsA/Atr treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores (NDS) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> ultrastructure and swelling were also examined after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In part 2, control and IPost groups underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (90 min) and reperfusion (15 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CsA and Atr groups were treated as described in part 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain mitochondria were isolated after reperfusion and MPTP activity was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IPost or CsA treatment significantly improved NDS and reduced infarction volume, while Atr reversed the neuroprotective effects of IPost, and attenuated the decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling induced by IPost or CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, inhibiting MPTP opening may play a crucial role in the neuroprotective effects of IPost, which may have potential clinical value against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
