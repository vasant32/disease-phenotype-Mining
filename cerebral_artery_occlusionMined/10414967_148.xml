<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> exert profound protective effects on the cerebral cortex in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major goal of this study was to begin to elucidate potential mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> action in injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 is a proto-oncogene that promotes cell survival in a variety of tissues including the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> is known to promote cell survival via Bcl-2 in non-neural tissues, we tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> decreases cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by influencing bcl-2 expression in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> may protect the brain through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-mediated mechanisms, we examined expression of both receptor subtypes ERalpha and ERbeta in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed gene expression by RT-PCR in microdissected regions of the cerebral cortex obtained from injured and sham female rats treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> or oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prevented the injury-induced downregulation of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was specific to bcl-2, as expression of other members of the bcl-2 family (bax, bcl-x(L), bcl-x(S), and bad) was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors were differentially modulated in injury, with ERbeta expression paralleling bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide the first evidence of functional ERbeta protein that is capable of binding ligand within the region of the cortex where <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> modulates the expression of bcl-2 in ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors may be involved in hormone-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
