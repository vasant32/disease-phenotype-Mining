<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) is protective to cortical neurons against various insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of NGF in relation to its high-affinity trkA receptor in the cortical neurons has not been well discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, we studied the possible involvement of the NGF/receptor system in the ischemic injury of cortical neurons after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats received right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 90 minutes' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were decapitated at different reperfusion time points: hour 4 and days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain sections at the level of striatum were immunostained against NGF, trkA, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and stress protein HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining against NGF and GFAP was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optical density of NGF immunoreactivity in the ischemic and nonischemic cortexes was compared between sham-control and ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the sham-control rats, NGF immunoreactivity was present in the cortical and striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, beginning at hour 4 after recirculation, there was a significant decrease of NGF in the ischemic cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beginning at day 1, NGF was absent completely in the infarcted striatum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra area, despite a decrease in NGF at hour 4 and day 1, NGF recovered beginning at day 3 and returned almost to the sham-control level at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the nonischemic cortex, NGF increased beginning at hour 4, peaked at day 7, and returned almost to the sham-control level at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The trkA and HSP70 immunoreactivities were not present in the sham-control cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, trkA was induced at hour 4 in the ischemic cortex and at days 1 and 3 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The HSP70 was induced at days 1 and 3 in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> penumbra area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells increased gradually, and NGF immunoreactivity in the GFAP-positive cells became gradually intense after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a temporal profile of NGF and trkA in the ischemic cortex and NGF expression by reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the NGF/receptor system may play a role in the astrocyte/neuron interaction under certain pathological conditions, such as focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
