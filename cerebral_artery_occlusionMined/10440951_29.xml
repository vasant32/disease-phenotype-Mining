<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T(1rho) is believed to probe water in close contact with macromolecules, revealing water spins with restricted rotational mobility relative to bulk water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is shown that T(1rho) increases within minutes of occlusion, thereby demonstrating it as a new, sensitive indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion at 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, T(1rho) remains elevated or increases in tissue destined to neuronal damage but returns to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level if no neuronal damage develops within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T(1rho) determined during the first 2 hours of reperfusion shows a significant positive correlation with the ultimate neuronal damage score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, T(1rho) is not affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that, by combining three magnetic resonance imaging coefficients, i.e. T(1rho), T(2), and diffusion, viable hypoperfused areas that do not develop neuronal damage within 24 hours can be distinguished correctly from tissue already destined for neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
