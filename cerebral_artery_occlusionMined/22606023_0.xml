<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the efficacy of intraperitoneal administration of DAEE on the treatment of a mouse model of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by unilateral permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DAEE-treatment (100 Î¼g/kg body weight injected at 0.5, 24, 48, 72 h after PMCAO) significantly restored the mice from PMCAO-induced neurological deficits including motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> when evaluated 48, 72, and 96 h after the PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DAEE facilitated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 on the infarction side of the brain when analyzed by Western immunoblot analysis, and it enhanced the number of phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive cells in the border areas between the infarction and non-infarction regions of the cerebral cortex, as estimated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume remained unchanged after DAEE-treatment, it is more likely that DAEE improved the neurological condition through enhanced neuronal functions of the remaining neurons in the damaged areas rather than by maintaining neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DAEE has a neuro-protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
