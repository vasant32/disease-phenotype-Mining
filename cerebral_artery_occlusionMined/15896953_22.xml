<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Brain aromatase has been shown to be increased in expression after neurotoxic damage and to exert neuroprotection via generation of local <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50114">oestrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the topography and time course of brain aromatase expression after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ovariectomised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prone spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent distal MCAO by electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed increased brain aromatase expression at 24h and 8 days in the cortical penumbra/peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones with no increase evident at 2h or 30 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double label studies indicate that some of the increased aromatase expression is associated with astrocytic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, this is the first evidence that aromatase protein is increased after MCAO and the location (peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>), time course (within 24h) and cellular localisation (astrocytic) indicate the potential for aromatase to promote the survival of cells in the penumbra after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by local synthesis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50114">oestrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
