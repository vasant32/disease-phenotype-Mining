<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Released ATP may act as a toxic agent, which causes cellular degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, mediated through P2X and P2Y receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying the various effects of purinoceptor modulators in models of cerebral damage are still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effect of P2 receptor inhibition after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats received either the non-selective P2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxalphosphate</z:chebi>-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) as control by the intracerebroventricular route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, these treatments were administered 10 min before MCAO and subsequently twice daily for 1 or 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery of motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> was tested at an elevated T-labyrinth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PPADS-treated group showed a significant reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>-induced sideslips compared with ACSF-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced in the PPADS group in comparison with the ACSF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in intermediately and profoundly injured cells in favour of intact cells in the PPADS group was revealed by quantification of celestine blue/acid fuchsin-stained cells in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data provide further evidence for the involvement of P2 receptors in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of P2 receptors at least partially reduces functional and morphological deficits after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
