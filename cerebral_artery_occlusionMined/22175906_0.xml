<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes or 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CG (0.4 or 0.8 g/kg) was administrated 90 minutes before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was evaluated by Evan's blue dye extravasations and brain water content, leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and albumin leakage were determined with an upright fluorescence microscope, and neuron damage was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling, and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3, p53, p53 upregulated modulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Focal cerebral I/R elicited a prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, an increase in leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and albumin leakage, as well as neuron damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the insults after focal cerebral I/R were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with CG significantly reduced focal cerebral I/R-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, cerebral microcirculatory disturbance, and neuron damage, suggesting the potential of CG as a prophylactic strategy for patients in danger of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
