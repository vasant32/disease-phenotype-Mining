<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the opioid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dynorphin1-13 improves survival chances in stroked cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some evidence also suggests that changes in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) uptake may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, therefore, we determined binding of the opiate [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EKC</z:e>), as well as <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> uptake in various brain regions of control, stroked and dynorphin1-13-treated stroked cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cats were stroked by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EKC</z:e> binding study, the Kd of the high-affinity site of the occluded cortex was significantly increased, relative to that of both the unoccluded side and control cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynorphin1-13 treatment reversed this effect, lowering the Kd to control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> uptake study, the Km was decreased and Vmax was increased significantly in unoccluded cortex, compared with that in the occluded cortex or in control cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Again, dynorphin1-13 reversed these effects, raising the Km and lowering the Vmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the Km of occluded cortex was also increased so that it became significantly higher than that of control cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Km of unoccluded subcortex in stroked cats treated with dynorphin1-13 was significantly reduced compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> uptake study, there was no significant change in any parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The change in opioid binding observed here and its reversal by dynorphin1-13 are consistent with the notion that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>'s beneficial effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is mediated through opiate receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since opioid systems in the brain are known to have association with dopaminergic ones, the change in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> uptake could also be the result of an opioid effect </plain></SENT>
