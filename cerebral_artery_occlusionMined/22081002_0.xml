<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The thrombolytic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is limited by a narrow therapeutic time window and is associated with significant adverse side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve this situation, the modulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity by a synthetic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-derived 18-mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (THR-18) was examined in two models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the first model (thromboembolic), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by intra-carotid injection of micro-clots to rats, and tPA (6 mg/kg) was intravenously infused for 30 minutes with or without THR-18 (1 mg/kg) at 4 hours post-induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second model [transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced for 2 hours by a transient mechanical occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>tPA and/or THR-18 (0.02, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) were intravenously infused for 60 minutes at the time of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the thromboembolic model, cerebral blood flow, measured before and up to 5.5 hours post-induction, revealed that tPA administration caused reperfusion of flow at 30 minutes post-infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Later on, an additional increase in reperfusion was seen in the tPA+THR-18 group, and not with tPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both models, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the tPA-treated group was found to be significantly higher than the control, and this tPA effect was attenuated by THR-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the thromboembolic study, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were similar in the control and tPA-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of tPA and THR-18 caused a statistically significant reduction in both parameters (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size 17.8 versus 25.0%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> 5 versus 8%, tPA+THR-18 versus control, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the tMCAO mechanical model, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were both increased by tPA treatment as compared to the control group, and this increase was markedly diminished by THR-18 co-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral assessment of the tMCAO animals performed at 72 hours post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction revealed significant improvements (P&lt;0.05-0.01) in neuroscores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of animals treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-tPA, as compared to the tPA monotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significant (P&lt;0.05) improvement in the neurological outcome was also seen in the THR-18 monoterapy group, as compared to the control animals, thus demonstrating a clear neuroprotective effect by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> on its own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results support the use of THR-18 together with tPA in the thrombolytic therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in order to achieve better patency, less tPA-induced damage, and possibly a widening of tPA therapeutic time window </plain></SENT>
