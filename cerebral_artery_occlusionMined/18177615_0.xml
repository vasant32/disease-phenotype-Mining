<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (18 in each group): shamoperated group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) roup,vehicle group and MCAO+BMSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model was established using modified Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMSC was labeled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> before the transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One day after right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(MCAO), 1 x 10(6) cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of rats in BMSCs-treated group and the same dose of PBS was given to the rats in vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before sacrificed and at 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO, the neurological functions were tested by balance beam, rota-rod and screen prehensile and the synaptophysin was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> stained positive cells were observed around the cerebral infarcted area in the BMSC-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the MCAO group and the vehicle group,the neurological functions in BMSC-treated group were better on 7 d and 14 d after MCAO (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), and the synaptophysin around the cerebral infarcted area was significantly upregulated on 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMSC transplantation can improve the neurological functions by upregulating the expression of synaptophysin after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
