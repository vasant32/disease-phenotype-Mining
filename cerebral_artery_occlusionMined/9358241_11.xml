<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the hyperglycemic exacerbation of brain injury is associated with enhanced generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> in rats subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2 h), followed by reperfusion (2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images revealed the exacerbation of focal brain injury in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> trapping method was used in conjunction with microdialysis to continuously estimate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> production by measurement of the stable adducts 2,3- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17189">2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (DHBA) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In normoglycemic rats, from a mean baseline level of 130 nmol/l, 2,3-DHBA levels surged to peak levels of 194 nmol/l 45 min into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to 197 nmol/l 15-30 min into the reperfusion period, returning to baseline by 2 h into reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar temporal profile was observed in hyperglycemic rats, except that absolute 2,3-DHBA levels were higher (165 nmol/l at baseline, 317 nmol/l peak during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 333 nmol/l peak during reperfusion), and levels remained significantly high (p &lt; .05) throughout the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> is an important contributor to the exacerbation of neuronal and cerebrovascular injury after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
