<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to a diffuse distribution of nerve terminal stainings for synaptophysin appearing as numerous small puncta, the large-sized cells with spindled or polygonal shapes revealed perikaryal staining for synaptophysin in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The double labeling with immunofluorescence technique disclosed that the cell bodies, immunoreactive for synaptophysin, appeared to be those of the striatal giant cholinergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, in rats that underwent the transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the striatal ischemic lesions with cell type-specific injury revealed a survival of synaptophysin-positive large cells, presumably identical with the cholinergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the metabolism and/or axonal transportation of synaptophysin of the giant cholinergic cells may be different from those of other neuronal populations in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, synaptophysin can act as a neurochemical marker for identification of the giant cholinergic neurons in the striatum of rats </plain></SENT>
