<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report our initial experience with a Solitaire AB neurovascular remodeling stent device in performing cerebral embolectomy in seven patients presenting to our institution with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were resistant to iv thrombolytic drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main inclusion criteria were: National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score ≥10; treatment performed within 8 h from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and no large hypodensity on CT; and occlusion of a major cerebral artery on the CT angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An admission and a post-interventional NIHSS score were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by two different neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed radiologically by post-treatment thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) scores and clinically by a 30-day Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of neurointerventional treatment was 84 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> interventions were successful, with TIMI scores of 2 or 3 achieved in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one procedural complication in our series owing to a self-detached stent and one patient had a small asymptomatic basal ganglia haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was improvement of more than 4 points on the NIHSS score in 5 (72%) of the patients following treatment, of whom 4 (57%) had a 30-day MRS score of ≤2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of a Solitaire stent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was safe, time-efficient and encouraging; however, a larger sample size will be required to further evaluate the use of this device, which could benefit a significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
