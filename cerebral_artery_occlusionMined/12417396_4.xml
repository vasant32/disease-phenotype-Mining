<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> by occluding the middle cerebral artery using the 4-0 intraluminal nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological tests performed after 24 h, 7 and 15 days of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion showed motor impairment as evidenced by decrease in the rota rod performance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was also confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when the learning and memory tests were performed, no change was observed in the learning and behavior as evidenced by insignificant difference in the retention latency in the passive avoidance test (334+/-31 s) and the transfer latency in the elevated plus maze (11+/-4.5 s) as compared to the sham-operated rats 369+/-34 and 8+/-1.7 s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study demonstrates that transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery does not impair the learning and memory behavior of the rats </plain></SENT>
