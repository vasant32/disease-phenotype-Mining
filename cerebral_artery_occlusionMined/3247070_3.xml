<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two post-ischemic circulatory disturbances that play a significant role in pathophysiology of an ischemic lesion are: (1) reactive hyperemia or hyperperfusion and (2) hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactive hyperemia promptly follows release of major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and it is associated with the opening of the blood-brain barrier to serum proteins and ensuing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevention or reduction of reactive hyperemia results in significant amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the resulting ischemic brain tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The post-ischemic hypoperfusion, studied in gerbils, develops soon after recirculation and usually lasts up to 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its relationship to post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is evident in repeated ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these studies, three ischemic insults of 5 min duration when applied at 1 h intervals, i.e., during the period of hypoperfusion, resulted in a cumulative effect, post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and tissue injury becoming considerably more pronounced that those following a single 15 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no cumulative effect when the ischemic insults were spaced 3 min or longer than 6 h apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that repeated ischemic insults taking place during the phase of post-ischemic hypoperfusion may significantly increase the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and brain tissue injury </plain></SENT>
