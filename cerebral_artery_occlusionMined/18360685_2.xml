<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In search of alternative medicines for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation, we recently identified the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway as a key mechanism underlying the biological activities of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> formulation ISF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to further investigate ISF-1 for HO-1 induction in cultured human cells and corresponding cytoprotective effects against oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was employed to verify the activity of ISF-1 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that HO-1 expression was induced by ISF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four ingredients from ISF-1 were identified to be responsible for HO-1 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The appropriate combinations of these active ingredients or purified compounds resulted in synergistic induction of HO-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A minimal HO-1-inducing formulation was prepared and showed significant cytoprotection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the herbal formulation ISF-1 was capable of inducing HO-1 expression, in vitro and in vivo, offering a potential mechanism for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study may shed light on the development of mechanism-defined therapies based on traditional herbal remedies </plain></SENT>
