<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the rather unexplored multifocal microsphere-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in rats was characterized by multiparametric MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We induced microembolic infarction in a group of Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting a dose of about 1000 50-microm <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> microspheres intracranially from the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T(2)-weighted MRI were used to evaluate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development during and following the first 3 hr after microsphere injection (N = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were also imaged at 12-hr (N = 8), 24-hr (N = 17), and 48-hr (N = 5) time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the final imaging time point, the brains were removed and sectioned into 2-mm-thick slices, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured by 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps, a volume of reduced <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> appeared 0.5-1.0 hr postinjection, and by the 3-hr time point the volume of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction had increased to a size of 5% +/- 1% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of the brain hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) to 16% +/- 2% of the hemisphere volume at the 12-hr time point, while at 24 hr the lesion (15% +/- 2% of the hemisphere) was also significantly larger (P &lt; 0.001) than at 3 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perfusion deficit resulting from the microsphere injection was immediate, going from a cerebral blood flow index (CBF(i)) of 74% +/- 3% at the time of microsphere injection to 68% +/- 2% of the contralateral mean at 3 hr (P &lt; 0.05), to 55% +/- 4% of the contralateral values at 12 hr (P &lt; 0.05), and to 57% +/- 2% of the contralateral mean at 24 hr (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion development in the microsphere-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model was found to be slower than in the MCAO model, and continued up to the 24-48-hr time point </plain></SENT>
