<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the combinatorial effects of Naomai Yihao (NMYH) Capsules and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene-transfected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in cerebral ischemic tissues in rats and the mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BMSCs were isolated and cultured from bone marrow by an adherence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, BMSCs were transfected with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP-VEGF165 by positive ionic liposome transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were allocated to six groups: model, BMSC, VEGF gene-transfected BMSC transplantation (BMSC/VEGF), NMYH, combined NMYH and BMSC/VEGF (combined treatment group) and sham operation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behavioral rating score (BRS) of rats and the expression of CD34 and VEGF in brain tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry on days 7, 14 and 21 after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> was observed and evaluated with laser scanning confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The BRS of rats in NMYH, BMSC transplantation and combined treatment groups was significantly lower than that of the model group (P &lt; 0.001), with no significant difference between NMYH and transplantation groups (P = 0.619) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD34 and VEGF in NMYH, transplantation and combined treatment groups increased (P &lt; 0.001), with a significant difference between NMYH and transplantation groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The blood vessel area in NMYH, transplantation and combined treatment groups was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), without a significant difference between NMYH and transplantation groups (P = 0.873) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEGF gene-transfected BMSCs improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the cerebral ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NMYH Capsules promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in MCAO rats treated with BMSC transplantation, which show an improved BRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may be related to up-regulation of VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
