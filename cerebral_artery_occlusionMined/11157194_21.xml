<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Harmful effects of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>) may depend on recurrent Ca(2+) influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, few studies have documented the relevance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> in gyrencephalic animals, and the progressive nature of this process has not been investigated over extended periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied in prolonged focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in cats spatial and temporal profiles of extracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](o)) shifts in relation to direct current (DC) potential, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) concentration and regional cerebral blood flow alterations, and final pathological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized cats receiving either vehicle (n=12) or MK-801 treatment (5 mg/kg IV; n=10), the left middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler probes, ion-selective microelectrodes, and NO electrodes measured simultaneously regional cerebral blood flow, DC potential, electrocorticogram, [Ca(2+)](o), and NO concentrations in ectosylvian and suprasylvian gyri of the left cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persistent depolarization immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 10 ectosylvian and 4 suprasylvian gyri of vehicle-treated animals and in 9 ectosylvian and 3 suprasylvian gyri of MK-801-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> associated with transient decreases of [Ca(2+)](o) were detected in suprasylvian gyri of only 4 vehicle-treated animals, of which 3 developed recurrent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocorticogram was suppressed during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>, and electrocorticogram recovery worsened in a stepwise manner with consecutive depolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> duration increased slightly with ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and evolved to persistent depolarization at a final stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NO transients were not detected during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>, and regional cerebral blood flow transients were not pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infarction was larger with initial persistent depolarization than with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> and was smallest in MK-801-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> is not a common finding in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zones in cats, and it is suppressed by the N:-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, if repeated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> are generated, they result in a stepwise, progressive breakdown of neuronal function and ion homeostasis, probably contributing to the growth of infarction in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrent Ca(2+) influx is a mechanism that presumably contributes to this process </plain></SENT>
