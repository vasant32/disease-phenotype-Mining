<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impairment of motor coordination and incidence of neurological deficits including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001504'>abnormal posture</z:mp> were present for the first 2 and 4 weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Learning behavior in one-trial passive avoidance task was disturbed for the entire 16-week period when rats were trained at days 3 after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reacquisition was also impaired when rats were retrained on 8 weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for synchronized EEG at days 2 after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, significant changes in spontaneous movement and EEG were not observed in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this rat model of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occlusion is useful for quantitatively measuring functional changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
