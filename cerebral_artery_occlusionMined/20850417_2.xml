<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Female gender, which is abolished following ovariectomy and reproductive senescence, is associated with improved outcome following cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> replacement partially restores this benefit of the female gender but the effect of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> in hormone-deficient animals is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated various outcomes following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in ovariectomised female mice, with a physiologically relevant restoration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ovariectomised female mice had significantly elevated plasma (P=&lt;0.05) and brain <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> levels (P=&lt;0.01) following implantation of a 21-day release pellet (50mg) compared with mice that received placebo implants 7 days prior to undergoing 60 min MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of well-being (body weight recovery) and neurological score at 24h and 48h post-MCAO indicated that MCAO significantly worsened outcome compared with sham-operated mice but <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCAO resulted in a substantial lesion formation and a significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in ipsilateral brain water content, both of which were not affected by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant alteration in ipsilateral Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression following MCAO or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that sustained physiologically relevant levels of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> neither benefited nor worsened outcomes in previously ovariectomised female mice </plain></SENT>
