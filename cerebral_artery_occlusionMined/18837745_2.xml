<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the activation of MAPK/ERK was inhibited using the upstream inhibitor of MAPK-ERK-kinase (MEK) U0126, and the effects on focal brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> were evaluated during normo- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Temporary (90 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in five groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>U0126 (400 microg kg(-1)) or vehicle was given as 60-min intravenous infusions starting either 30 min prior to MCAO or 30 min prior to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined by perfusion with tetrazolium red after 24 h of survival, and the neurology was tested with the 4-level scale of Bederson and performance on an inclined plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect on the targeted MEK enzyme was investigated by analysing the phosphorylation of the downstream target ERK with western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two subgroups were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: U0126 effectively reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurology in hyperglycaemic rats both when given before and after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was not accompanied by any detectable changes in cerebral blood flow on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Normoglycaemic rats had generally milder injuries compared with the hyperglycaemic and there was a nonsignificant trend for U0126 to reduce damage also in the nonhyperglycaemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, U0126 appears to be neuroprotective in this model of hyperglycaemic ischaemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings support the pathogenic importance of the MEK-ERK pathway in hyperglycaemic-ischaemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
