<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 53 consecutive patients, serial venous blood samples were taken on admission, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurovascular status was assessed by repetitive extracranial and transcranial duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits were quantified by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale, and functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean GFAP values were elevated from admission on with highest levels 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GFAP release was highly correlated with severity of neurologic deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with persistent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, GFAP increased significantly compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sonographic findings (P = 0.019) and recanalization after thrombolysis resulted in a significant reduced increase (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GFAP concentrations were associated with the functional outcome after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Release kinetics of GFAP are associated with patients clinical deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, depend on the neurovascular status on admission and on early recanalization after thrombolysis, and may be used as an additional predictor of the early course and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
