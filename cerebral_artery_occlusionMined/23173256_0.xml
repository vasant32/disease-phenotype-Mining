<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury was established using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) by reversibly inserting a nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group, the I/R model group, and the low, middle, and high dose STB groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neural functional disturbance was scored referring to the 5-grade Zea Longa EL standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of NMDAR1 in the ischemic side was detected using immunohistochemical assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was statistical difference in the scores of the neural functional disturbance in the middle and high dose STB groups when compared with the model group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of the immunohistochemical assay showed the expression of NMDAR1 in CA1 region was obviously higher in the I/R model group, the low and middle dose STB groups than in the sham-operation group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of NMDAR1 in CA1 region was obviously lower in the high dose STB group than in the I/R model group (P &lt; 0.01), the low (P &lt; 0.01) and middle dose STB groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of NMDAR1 in CA3 region was obviously higher in the low dose STB group and the I/R model group than in the sham-operation group, the middle and high dose STB groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of NMDAR1 in CA3 region was obviously higher in the high and middle dose STB groups than in the sham-operation group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STB could promote the recovery of neural functions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>STB fought against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury by lowering excitable neurotransmitter glumatic acid and reducing the protein expression of NMDAR1 </plain></SENT>
