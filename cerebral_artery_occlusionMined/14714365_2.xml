<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion in rats and the effect of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29749">ferulate</z:chebi> (SF) on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five male adult SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, the sham-operated group, the control group and the SF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established by thread ligation method, and in the ischemic phase, to rats in the sham-operated and the control group 4 ml of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was intraperitoneally injected, and to rats in the SF group, 100 mg/kg of SF dissolved in 4 ml of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were decapitated at 2 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 72 hrs after reperfusion, 3 rats of every group at each time point, and rats brains were taken for immunohistochemistry and histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathological examination showed that the cerebral ischemic damage in the SF group was significantly milder than that in the control group at 2 hrs after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced ERK activation reached the peak at 6 hrs and maintained to 72 hrs after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared with the control group, the ERK activation in the SF group was significantly enhanced with increased positive immune reacted cells (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion could induce the activation of ERK in the ischemic brain cells, intervention of SF could enhance the activation and alleviate the ischemic injury in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
