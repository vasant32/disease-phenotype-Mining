<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated immunohistochemically the cellular localization of multifunctional type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the rat basal ganglia and intrastriatal grafts derived from fetal striatal primordia, in comparison with that of calcineurin, a reliable marker for striatal medium-sized spinous neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive neurons were of medium size, with a mean diameter of 16.1 +/- microns (average +/- S.D., n = 72, range 13.6-18.3 microns) and comprised approximately 70% of the total neuronal population in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed that the type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive cells had round, triangular or polygonal cell bodies with relatively little cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of serial sections showed that type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin immunoreactivities were co-localized in the striatal neurons examined with a similar distribution pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive cells were always immunoreactive for calcineurin and cells negative for type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase showed no apparent calcineurin immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive nerve fibers in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra almost disappeared following striatal ischemic injury produced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and cerebral hemitransection, respectively, suggesting that these immunopositive fibers were striatal projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, most type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive neurons in the rat striatum are considered to be of the medium-sized spinous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or calcineurin immunoreactivity was also observed in a large number of neurons in transplants derived from fetal striatal primordia grafted into striatal ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, type II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase- or calcineurin-immunoreactive nerve fibers appeared in the deafferented globus pallidus of the host rats, suggesting that the striatopallidal pathway was reformed by striatal projection neurons of the transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding may also indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-regulated enzymes are useful for tracing striatal projection fibers as endogenous marker proteins </plain></SENT>
