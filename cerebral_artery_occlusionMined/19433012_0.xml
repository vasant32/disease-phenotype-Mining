<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on neurological deficits, proliferation and differentiation of nerve stem cells (NSCs) in adult rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and to study its possible role in the treatment of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of MCAO was established and interfered with EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On days 4, 7, 14 and 21 after ischemic injury, neurological deficits were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On days 4, 7, 14 and 21 after injury, effect of EA interference on the proliferation and differentiation of rat NSCs was observed with BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP immunofluorescence double labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the scores of rat neurological deficits between the EA and model groups 7, 14 and 21 days after cerebral ischemic injury (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BrdU positive cells were found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of positive BrdU cells in the SVZ reached its peak 7 days after injury and was greater in the EA group than in the model group 7 and 14 days after injury (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of BrdU/GFAP doubly labeled positive cells in the SVZ was greater in the EA group than in the model group 7 and 14 days after ischemic injury (p=0.012 and p=0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the number of BrdU/NeuN doubly labeled positive cells 4, 7 and 14 days in the striatum, but a significant difference 21 days (p=0.033) after ischemic injury between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Cerebral ischemic injury induces proliferation of NSCs, some of which will differentiate into both astroglia and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EA may promote cells proliferation, stimulate the proliferating cells to differentiate into astroglia and mature into neurons, which may be one of the important reasons why EA can alleviate neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
