<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage mainly depends on physical treatment and rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aim to establish cell therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using embryonic stem (ES) cells, which have self-renewing and pluripotent capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the transplanted monkey and mouse ES cell-derived neural progenitors, by stromal cell-derived inducing activity method, could survive and differentiate into various types of neurons and glial cells, and form the neuronal network in basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we induced the differentiation of the neural progenitors from mouse ES cells using the serum-free suspension culture method and confirmed the expression of various basal ganglial neuronal markers and neurotransmitter-related markers both in vitro and in vivo, which was thought to be suitable for replacing damaged striatum after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that used selectively induced telencephalic neural progenitors into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we purified the progenitors expressing the neural progenitor marker Sox1 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Sox1-positive neural progenitors prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation in ischemic brain for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed survival and differentiation of transplanted cells and functional recovery from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
