<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, we reported a neuroprotective effect for Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) ethanolic extract in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>-(MCAO) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sheds more light on the extract's mechanism of neuroprotection, especially its immunomodulatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After 15 days of treatment with Hawthorn extract [100 mg/kg, pretreatment (oral)], male Sprague Dawley rats underwent transient MCAO for 75 mins followed by reperfusion (either 3 or 24 hrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), ICAM-1, IL-10 and pSTAT-3 expression in the brain by appropriate methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also looked at the cytotoxic T cell sub-population among leukocytes (FACS) and inflammatory cell activation and recruitment in brain (using a myeloperoxidase activity assay) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> (TUNEL), and Bcl-xL- and Foxp3- (T(reg) marker) positive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the brain were analyzed separately using immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results indicate that occlusion followed by 3 hrs of reperfusion increased pro-inflammatory cytokine and ICAM-1 gene expressions in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and that Hawthorn pre-treatment significantly (p ≤ 0.01) lowered these levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, such pre-treatment was able to increase IL-10 levels and Foxp3-positive cells in brain after 24 hrs of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in cytotoxic T cell population in vehicle rats after 24 hrs of reperfusion was decreased by at least 40% with Hawthorn pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a decrease in inflammatory cell activation and infiltration in pretreated brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hawthorn pretreatment elevated pSTAT-3 levels in brain after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increase in Bcl-xL-positive cells, which in turn may have influenced the reduction in TUNEL-positive cells compared to vehicle-treated brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Hawthorn extract helped alleviate pro-inflammatory immune responses associated with I/R-induced injury, boosted IL-10 levels, and increased Foxp3-positive T(regs) in the brain, which may have aided in suppression of activated inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such treatment also minimizes apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by influencing STAT-3 phosphorylation and Bcl-xL expression in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the immunomodulatory effect of Hawthorn extract may play a critical role in the neuroprotection observed in this MCAO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
