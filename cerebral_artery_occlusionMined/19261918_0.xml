<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In ischemic brain, endothelin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are known to produce vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nonischemic brain, pial arterioles constrict after Hb exchange transfusion, and the constriction is blocked by an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51452">endothelin A receptor antagonist</z:chebi> increase pial arteriolar dilation after Hb exchange transfusion during MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pial arteriolar diameter was measured in the ischemic border region of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> border region through closed cranial windows in anesthetized rats subjected to the filament model of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 2 h of MCAO, pial arteriolar dilation gradually subsided from 37 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 5% (+/-SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with residual dilation at 2 h of MCAO with vehicle superfusion (14 +/- 3%), loss of dilation was not prevented by superfusion of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor (21 +/- 5%), partial Hb exchange transfusion (7 +/- 5%) that <z:mp ids='MP_0000208'>decreased hematocrit</z:mp> to 23%, or a combination of the two (5 +/- 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, loss of dilation was prevented by superfusion of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51452">endothelin A receptor antagonist</z:chebi> with (35 +/- 4%) or without (32 +/- 5%) Hb transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pial artery constriction during reperfusion was attenuated by HET0016 alone and by BQ610 with or without Hb transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of the endothelin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> during prolonged MCAO increased blood flow in the border region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus loss of pial arteriolar dilation in the ischemic border region during prolonged MCAO depends on endothelin A receptor activation, and this effect was independent of the presence of cell-free Hb polymers in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous work in nonischemic brain, inhibition of oxygen-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> synthesis does not significantly influence the pial arteriolar response to polymeric Hb exchange transfusion during focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
