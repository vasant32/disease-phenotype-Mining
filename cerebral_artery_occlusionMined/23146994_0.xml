<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current models dictate that, depending on occurrence of early reperfusion, the ischemic penumbra either undergoes or escapes infarction (i.e., "pan-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, tissue outcome following temporary middle-cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) in rodents can also include selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> (SNL), which even if subtle may impede functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to explore the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, determine potential therapeutic targets and monitor effects of therapy, in vivo imaging surrogates of these varied histopathological outcomes applicable in the clinical setting would be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although hyperintense signal on T(2)-weighted MRI in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stage is considered a reliable surrogate of tissue infarction, SNL is not associated with T(2)W abnormal signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clinical setting, the neuron-specific PET ligand (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ) has been used to identify both pan-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> SNL, but this inference has not been histopathological confirmed so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the late tissue sequelae of tMCAo in the rodent using in vivo T(2)W MRI and FMZ-PET against post mortem immunohistochemistry as gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) underwent 45min distal-clip middle-cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and, 28days later, FMZ-PET and T(2)W-MRI, immediately followed by immunohistochemistry for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> (NeuN), activated microglia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on standard histopathological definitions, ischemic lesions were classified into pan-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, partial infarction or SNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NeuN changes and FMZ binding across the whole hemisphere were quantified in the same set of 44 regions-of-interest according to previously validated protocols; linear regressions between these two measures were carried out both within and across subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both cortical pan-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>/partial infarction and SNL were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats except one, where SNL was isolated and extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infarction/partial infarction, but not SNL, was associated with T(2)W hyperintense signals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FMZ binding was decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of lesions including SNL, in proportion with NeuN staining intensity both within (p&lt;0.05 to &lt;0.001) and across (p&lt;0.001) subjects, including the subject that showed pure SNL (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This novel study revealed three main facts: i) long-term histopathological cortical changes following 45min tMCAo in SHRs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of SNL, partial infarction and frank infarction; ii) T2W MRI showed conspicuous high signal lesions for complete or partial infarction, but no changes for SNL; and iii) FMZ-PET was sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of tMCAo-induced histopathological changes, including isolated SNL, suggesting it is a valid surrogate for the histological sequelae of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the finding of almost universal completed cortical infarction at 28days differed from our previous findings at 14-day survival using exactly the same experimental protocol and rat strain, where SNL was the almost exclusive outcome, suggesting a phenomenon of delayed cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation whereby the extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> present at two weeks matures into infarction at four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to investigate this intriguing observation </plain></SENT>
