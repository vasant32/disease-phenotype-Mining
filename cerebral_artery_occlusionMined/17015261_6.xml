<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> property of SAC has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of SAC in cerebral ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAC decreased the size of infarction after transient or global ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While it did not alter the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity, SAC significantly scavenged the endogenously or exogenously produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SAC has much lower scavenging activity against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, O2*(-) or NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, SAC inhibited the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) increased in cultured neurons exposed to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation or in rat brain tissue after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of SAC was mimicked by the ERK inhibitor U0125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that SAC exert its neuroprotective effect by scavenging <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29330">ONOO</z:chebi>- and inhibiting the ERK signaling pathway activated during initial hypoxic/ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
