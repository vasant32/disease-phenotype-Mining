<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop clinically useful therapies that successfully manipulate the complement cascade, the individual roles of its components must be clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that C5 inhibition improves outcome after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the role of C5a in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury by inhibiting its activity at the receptor level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C5a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or vehicle was administered to mice before temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> outcomes were assessed 24 hours later in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice using both neurological deficit scores and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals treated with C5a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> experienced significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and demonstrated an improving trend in neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that modulation of C5a receptor activity significantly alters the degree of neurological damage after experimental reperfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
