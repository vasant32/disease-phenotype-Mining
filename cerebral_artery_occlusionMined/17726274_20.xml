<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (PROG) has a substantial protective effect against several types of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since most cases of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are caused by permanent occlusion of cerebral arteries, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of PROG on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and behavioral deficits in a permanent MCAO (pMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: pMCAO was produced by surgical insertion of a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated nylon filament into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor cerebral blood flow for 10 min post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROG (8 mg/kg) or vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) was administered intraperitoneally at 1 h post-occlusion followed by subcutaneous injections at 6, 24 and 48 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (cortical, subcortical and total) were performed at 72 h and functional recovery, assessed by rotarod test, were performed 24, 48, and 72 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following PROG treatment, stained sections revealed a significant reduction in cortical, caudate-putamen and hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (% contralateral structure) compared to vehicle-injected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, PROG treatment reduced functional deficits on the accelerating rotarod apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated and confirmed the neuroprotective effect of PROG using a permanent model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
