<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that supports the survival and growth of neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noggin, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), promotes the differentiation of stem cells into neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we hypothesize that transfection of NGF and Noggin in BMSC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> promotes BMSC neuronal differentiation and improves functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adenovirus was used to trasfect NGF and Noggin and the transfection efficiency was measured by Western blot and immunostaining in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transfected BMSCs with NGF and/or Noggin were administered intravenously at 5 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological functional outcome and BMSC migration and differentiation in the ischemic brain were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transplantation of BMSCs with NGF or Noggin elicited neurological functional improvement, promoted BMSCs present in the ischemic brain, and also up-regulated neuro-like cell differentiation as well as increased synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared with nontreatment control animals (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a combination of transfection of NGF and Noggin in BMSCs induced a synergistic effect on improved neurological functional outcome, BMSCs present in the ischemic brain, and synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared with BMSCs transfected with an NGF- or Noggin-alone group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that increasing NGF or Noggin expression in BMSCs contributes to brain plasticity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that a synergistic effect is induced on the coexistence of NGF and Noggin in BMSCs treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
