<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NT-3 significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NT-3 protects neuronal cells from ischemic injury, and it is possibly associated with inhibition of DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
