<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether a hookworm-derived recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor (rNIF) is neuroprotective when administered after initiation of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the rNIF dose-response on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, the therapeutic time window, the therapeutic response to permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and whether rNIF treatment delays the maturation of the ischemic lesion (2 days), or reduces cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 7 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced by an insertion of intraluminal 4-0 monofilament nylon suture into internal carotid artery (n=195) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate a significant neuroprotective effect of rNIF administration 48 h after MCAO in a dose-dependent fashion when treatment was initiated upon reperfusion after 2 h MCAO and maintained until 48 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect was lost under conditions of permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic time window is 4 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brief treatment (6 h) is not sufficient to provide protection for the final ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous treatment with a high dose of rNIF for a long duration (7 days) is necessary to achieve maximum neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
