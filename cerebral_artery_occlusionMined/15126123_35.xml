<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler and Evans Blue assay revealed that BMSC grafts dose-dependently restored CBF and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels at a much earlier period (Days 4-5 post-MCAo) in transplanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals that received saline infusion (Days 11-14 post-MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Xenografted BMSCs survived in the absence of immunosuppression, and elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of neurotrophic factors were detected in transplanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that early restoration of CBF and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> following transplantation of BMSCs could mediate the reported functional outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
