<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory effect of ginsenosides Rg3 and Rh2, which improves ischemic brain injury induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, was investigated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) and IFN-gamma-induced murine BV-2 microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ginsenoside Rh2 inhibited the production of NO, with an IC50 value of 17 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of Rh2 on NO correlates with the decreased protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ginsenoside Rh2 inhibited the expression of COX-2, pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in BV-2 cells induced by LPS/IFN-gamma, while it increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that ginsenoside Rh2 significantly inhibited the LPS/IFN-gamma-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity, while it enhanced the protein binding to CRE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it did not affect NF-kappaB binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of Rh2 appears to depend on the AP-1 and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory effect of ginsenoside Rg3 against LPS/IFN-gamma-activated BV-2 cells was less potent than that of ginsenoside Rh2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the in vivo anti-ischemic effect of ginsenoside Rg3 may originate from ginsenoside Rh2, which is a main metabolite of ginsenoside Rg3 by intestinal microflora, and that of ginsenoside Rh2 may be due to its anti-inflammatory effect in brain microglia </plain></SENT>
