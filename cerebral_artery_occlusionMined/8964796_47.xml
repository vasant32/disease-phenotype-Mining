<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that treatment of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat with antibodies directed against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 31) were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion induced by intraluminal insertion of a nylon monofilament into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon reperfusion, animals were treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1) (n = 8) or integrin CD11b/CD18 (n = 10), or administered IgG1 as a control (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, animals were killed and the brains analyzed for ischemic cell damage, using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H/E); <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) method; and inflammatory cells, using immunohistochemistry with an anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data revealed a significant reduction in the volume of infarction (p &lt; 0.01) and a decline in the absolute (p &lt; 0.001), and normalized (to the ischemic areas, p &lt; 0.05) numbers of apoptotic cells in both animals treated with anti-ICAM-1 and anti-CD11b antibodies compared to control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of immunoreactive MPO cells were also reduced in the treatment groups compared to those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that treatment with anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule antibodies selectively reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and that a contributing factor to the beneficial effect of antibody treatment for reducing ischemic cell damage may be a reduction in numbers of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
