<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) under anesthesia with intraperitoneal administration of ketamine alone or in combination with midazolam (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological scoring was conducted the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measured at 4 h and 24 h after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was performed using TUNEL staining 72 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After MCAO, the neurological scores showed no significant difference between ketamine and ketamine-midazolam groups (1.57+/-0.65 vs 1.74+/-0.52, P&gt;0.05), but the rats in the latter group had significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (38.48/+/-4.18/ vs 24.1/+/-4.63/, P&lt;0.05) and lower apoptotic cell density (258+/-15 cells/mm2 vs 178+/-23 cells/mm2, P&lt;0.05) in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with ketamine used alone, anesthesia with the combination of ketamine and midazolam may provide neuroprotection from ischemic cerebral injury by reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and lowering the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate following MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
