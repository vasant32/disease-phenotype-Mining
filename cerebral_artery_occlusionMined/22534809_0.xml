<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Stem cell transplantation has been extensively studied as individual therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation is an initial effort to combine these methods to achieve increased therapeutic effects after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell transplantation may recover massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> by replacing damaged brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells were used to induce differentiation in vitro into neuron-like cells with good cell viability for use a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced in rats using intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and infused mES cells after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were examined behaviorally using motor and sensory test with neurological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Motor function of the recipients was gradually improved, whereas little improvement was observed in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result may suggest that the grafted cells have synaptic connection in the recipient brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that stem cell transplantation can have a positive effect on behavioral recovery and reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in focal ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently after euthanasia, rats were histochemically investigated to explore graft survival with green fluorescent protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mouse embryonic stem cells may have advantage for use as a donor source in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> including motor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
