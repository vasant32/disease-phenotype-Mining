<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To test the hypothesis that matrix metalloprotease-13 (MMP-13) and aggrecan may play roles in post-ischemic neuronal pathophysiology, we examined the impact of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion (MCAO/R) on the abundance of these proteins in different regions of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of MCAO/R on the abundance of MMP-13 and aggrecan was examined in 23 Wistar rats using antibodies against MMP-13 and aggrecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BrdU was administered the last 2 days of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular source of the respective antigens was examined with fluorescent double labeling using the neuronal marker NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were also stained for BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic zone was defined by MRI on T2-weighted images and also on the tissue sections with the help of H and E counterstain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WB was performed for MMP-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-13 protein is highly induced in ischemic brain and is associated with neurons, whereas aggrecan is associated with the perineuronal matrix in non-ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the number of MMP-13 positive neurons in the periphery of the ischemic lesion increased compared to the respective area in the non-ischemic brain with a peak on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A stronger staining for aggrecan was observed around MMP-13 positive neurons compared with other neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of the MMP-13 positive neurons in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-ischemic brain were also NeuN positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BrdU was incorporated into MMP-13 positive neurons in the periphery of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>WB confirmed this results by detecting MMP-13 bands in ischemic brains and activated MMP-13 up to 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a close spatial association of MMP-13 and aggrecan around individual neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both MMP-13 and aggrecan appear to be involved in perineuronal matrix remodeling suggesting a role in neuronal reorganization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
