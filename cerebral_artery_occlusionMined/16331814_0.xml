<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish a new photomacrographic analysis of morphological changes on brain surface to evaluate blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed 10 min, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The whole brains and brain slices were photographed by a digital camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was evaluated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and traced Evans blue (EB) on the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluoremetric quantitation of EB and water content in the brains were also performed at various time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Photomacrographic morphological analysis showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and traced EB on the surface of the brains significantly increased from 3 h after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>,which were correlated to the results in the brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EB content in the ischemic hemispheres was significantly increased from 0.5 h after MCAO, and water content was increased from 1 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Photomacrographic measurement is a simple and useful method for evaluating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption semi-quantitatively, and can detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption earlier after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
