<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether salvianolic acid B improves the recovery of motor function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a 14-day investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor function was evaluated with beam-walking performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neural cell injury in both the sensorimotor cortex and CA1 of the hippocampus ipsilateral to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was studied by Nissl stain with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integrity of cerebral microvessels was monitored by immunoglobulin extravasations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis in the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was detected with 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving salvianolic acid B at a dose of 10 mg/kg had a more rapid recovery of beam-walking performance than vehicle-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> animals, and the improvement became significant at 10 and 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with salvianolic acid B at a dose of 10 mg/kg also significantly prevented neural cell loss in CA1 of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neural cells in the sensorimotor cortex were also preserved in animals that received salvianolic acid B at a high dose of 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Salvianolic acid B (10 mg/kg) also improved the integrity of microvessels after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed a slight increase in 5'-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus in the animals treated with salvianolic acid B at a dose of 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that salvianolic acid B could improve the recovery of motor function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
