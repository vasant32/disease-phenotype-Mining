<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although in the last years some studies have been performed to increase the efficacy of rehabilitative experience and training, the pharmacological approaches in this context remain poorly developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to study the effect of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi>, a safe and well-tolerated drug that is known to stabilize membranes, on functional outcome and neuromorphological changes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional recovery we have performed the staircase reaching test and the elevated body swing test (EBST), for studying sensorimotor integration and asymmetrical motor function respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi>, initiated 24 h after the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and maintained during 28 days, improved the functional outcome in both the staircase test (MCAO+<z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>=87.0+/-6.6% pellets eaten vs. MCAO+SAL=40.0+/-4.5%; p&lt;0.05) and the EBST (MCAO+<z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>=70.0+/-6.8% vs. MCAO+SAL=88.0+/-5.4%; contralateral swing p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, to study potential neuronal substrates of the improved function, we examined the dendritic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of layer V pyramidal cells in the undamaged motor cortex using a Golgi-Cox procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> showed enhanced dendritic complexity and spine density compared with saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16436,49086">CDP-choline</z:chebi> initiated 24 h after the insult is able to increase the neuronal plasticity within noninjured and functionally connected brain regions as well as to promote functional recovery </plain></SENT>
