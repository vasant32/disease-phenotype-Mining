<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pressure gradient of 8 mm Hg developed between ischemic tissue and normally perfused tissue during a 4-hour observation period after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain water accumulated as tissue pressure rose, while blood flow in the same area fell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest, but do not prove, that ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> causes tissue pressure to rise focally, and that blood flow to the ischemic zone is compromised further by the resultant hydrostatic pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
