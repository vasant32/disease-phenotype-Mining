<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thorough preclinical efficacy testing of human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) is, however, required for translation into a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) here confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage and allowed the targeted injection of 450,000 hNSCs (CTX0E03) into peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> tissue, rather than the lesion <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraparenchymal cell implants improved sensorimotor dysfunctions (bilateral asymmetry test) and motor deficits (footfault test and rotameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, analyses based on lesion topology (striatal vs. striatal + cortical damage) revealed a more significant improvement in animals with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> confined to the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no improvement in learning and memory (water maze) was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An intracerebroventricular injection of cells did not result in any improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI-based lesion, striatal and cortical volumes were unchanged in treated animals compared to those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that received an intraparenchymal injection of suspension vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grafted cells only survived after intraparenchymal injection with a striatal + cortical topology resulting in better graft survival (16,026 cells) than in animals with smaller striatal lesions (2,374 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost 20% of cells differentiated into glial fibrillary acidic protein+ astrocytes, but &lt;2% turned into FOX3+ neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CTX0E03 implants robustly recover behavioral dysfunction over a 3-month time frame and that this effect is specific to their site of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesion topology is potentially an important factor in the recovery, with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> confined to the striatum showing a better outcome compared to a larger area of damage </plain></SENT>
