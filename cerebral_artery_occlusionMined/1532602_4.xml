<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified five patients with different focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> documented on computerized tomography scan who had abnormal blink-to-threat reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One had a homonymous hemianopia secondary to posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; another had a unilateral parietal neglect; and a third had a frontal neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They did not blink in response to visual stimuli contralateral to their lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cortically blind patient and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Balint's syndrome</z:e> did not have a blink response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observation of these and other similar patients and animals previously reported suggests that the blink-to-threat reflex is cortically mediated and requires intact primary visual cortex as well as higher order mechanisms for visual attention mediated in the inferior parietal lobule and frontal eye fields </plain></SENT>
