<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), rats received either CGP 40116 (20 mg/kg i.p.) or isotonic saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two MRI scans were performed in each animal 2 and 28 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the second scan, rats were perfusion fixed for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of lesioned brain tissue as determined by MRI or histology was calculated from the damaged area in single sections and the distance between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CGP 40116 reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as measured by MRI 2 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion by 44% (p &lt; 0.05, analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 28 days the lesion detected by MRI was still significantly smaller in the drug-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed by the histological analysis showing a 64% reduction in the volume of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the CGP 40116 group (p &lt; 0.05, analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the MRI data and the results of the histological evaluation (r = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that (a) the competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CGP 40116 permanently protects brain tissue from the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a rat model for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and (b) early and late pathological changes can be accurately measured by MRI </plain></SENT>
