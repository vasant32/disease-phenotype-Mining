<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MARCO is an inducible member of the scavenger receptor family unique to cells of monocytic lineage and is a cell surface marker that plays a critical role in the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the role of MARCO in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, we investigated its expression in mice following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No MARCO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed in naive mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in expression of MARCO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> following transient occlusion (60min) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> at any time point up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant, marked increase in MARCO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was observed at 24 h in the cortex of mouse brains after a permanent occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
