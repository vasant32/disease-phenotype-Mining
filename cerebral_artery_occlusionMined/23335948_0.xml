<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transplanted cells are found in the infarcted hemisphere and the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this project was to determine the nature of the interaction between the HUCB MNCs cells and splenic immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and received i.v. injection of either vehicle (MCAO only), HUCB MNCs or MNCs depleted of CD14+ monocytes, CD133+ stem cells or CD19+ B cells 48 hours post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours post-MCAO, the animals were euthanized and the spleens and blood MNCs harvested for flow cytometry and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HUCB cell preparations decreased the percentage of T cells in the spleen and monocytes in the blood (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNCs depleted of CD14+ and CD19+ decreased the percentage of macrophage (p &lt; 0.001), while CD133 depleted MNCs increased the percentage of macrophage in spleen (p &lt; 0.001); MNC did not alter the macrophage population from the level observed after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only HUCB MNC significantly decreased Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced T cell stimulation (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the effects of HUCB MNC in the spleen are not due to a single HUCB population, but the interaction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subpopulations together </plain></SENT>
