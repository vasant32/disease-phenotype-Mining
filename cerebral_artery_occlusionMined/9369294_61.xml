<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nestin is a distinct intermediate filament which is transiently expressed in proliferating neuroepithelial stem cells during the neurulation stage of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nestin re-expression in the adult rat was studied following transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the ischemic insult, nestin reactive astrocytes were found in the border zone surrounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nestin immunoreactivity delineated a zone between infarction and the surrounding intact cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for nestin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed early changes in small cells in the surround of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results with nestin, along with other stem cell markers expressed by reactive astrocytes, suggest an embryonic reversion of the mature cytoskeleton as a response of astrocytes to cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
