<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) transplantation against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and to delineate the possible underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral I/R injury was established by 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EPCs were isolated from bone marrow of the donor rats, grown in conditioned medium, and characterized by flow cytometry analysis of several surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Labeled EPCs (106 cells) were infused into rats at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion and 12 h after reperfusion via the tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed at 24 h after reperfusion by using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins including Bcl-2 and Bax was determined by western blot analysis, and the activity of caspase-3 was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the activities of some antioxidative enzymes, such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-PX), the non-enzymatic scavenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and detected the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the ischemic regions of rats was examined by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that transplantation of EPCs significantly reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, decreased caspase-3 activity, upregulated Bcl-2 expression, and downregulated the expression of Bax and NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reduced levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, significantly elevated activities of SOD and GSH as well as GSH-PX were also found in I/R rats transplanted with EPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data demonstrated that transplantation of bone marrow-derived EPCs exerts potent neuroprotective functions against cerebral I/R injury in rats, and the protective effects may be associated with its antioxidative and anti-apoptotic properties </plain></SENT>
