<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Xuezhikang and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in rat, as well as the influences after intervention with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rats were given orally with Xuezhikang and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> or vehicle for 2 weeks, and then subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 120 min using intraluminal filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> were injected into the lateral ventricles in half of the rats treated with Xuezhikang and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 45 min before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits examinations were performed at 2, 24, 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the last examination the animals were sacrificed, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined by TTC staining, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Xuezhikang and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> both significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved the functional recovery when compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Xuezhikang and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> both significantly decreased the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> accumulation after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> partially inhibited the protective effect of Xuezhikang but nearly completely abolished the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Xuezhikang has protective effects on ischemic brain damage in rats, which the beneficial effects are partly due to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other components in Xuezhikang may also account for the neuroprotective effects, which is worth further investigations </plain></SENT>
