<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>JAK-STAT is the major downstream signal pathway of interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family and is regulated by Tyr705 phosphorylation of Stat3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the extent and the localization of phosphorylated Stat3 protein in brain tissue after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The localizations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Stat3 were immunohistochemically examined in rats after 0.5 to 168 h of reperfusion following 1.5 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), induced by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactive cell counts were made in the cerebral cortex (ischemic core, peri-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> region, and contralareral cortex) and lateral striatal regions on both the ischemic and the contralateral sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stat3 protein was localized diffusely in cortical and striatal neurons in the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although weak Stat3 staining was detected in damaged neurons in the ischemic region, activated microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells clearly expressed Stat3 in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the sham group showed no phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated Stat3 immunoreactivity was first detected in neurons after 3.5 h of reperfusion in each cortical and striatal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, Stat3 phosphorylation was marked in neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, peaked at 24 h, and then gradually declined throughout the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells expressed phosphorylated Stat3 in the ischemic core at 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To identify the cellular source of phosphorylated Stat3, lectin histochemical study and immunohistochemical study with anti-microtubule-associated proten-2 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Double-staining immunohistochemistry with these cellular makers revealed phosphorylated Stat3 to be present in neurons, but in neither astrocytes nor microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results were also confirmed be western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that Stat3 activation occurs in neurons and endothelial cells only during post-ischemic reperfusion despite widespread expression of IL-6 cytokines </plain></SENT>
