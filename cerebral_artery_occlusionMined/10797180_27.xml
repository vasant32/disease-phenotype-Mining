<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leukocytes contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few experimental models examine both in vivo behavior of leukocytes and microvascular rheology after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to characterize patterns of leukocyte accumulation in the cerebral microcirculation and to examine the relationship between leukocyte accumulation and microcirculatory hemodynamics after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion (MCAO-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male rats (250 to 350 g) were anesthetized and ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tail catheters were inserted for measurement of arterial blood gases and administration of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO by the filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cranial-window preparation was performed, and the brain was superfused with warm, aerated artificial cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the filament, and the pial microcirculation was observed by use of intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte accumulation in venules, arterioles, and capillaries; leukocyte rolling in venules; and leukocyte venular shear rate were assessed during 1 hour of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significant leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in cerebral venules during 1 hour of reperfusion after 2 hours of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte trapping in capillaries and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to arterioles after MCAO-R tended to increase compared with controls, but the increase was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also found that shear rate was significantly reduced in venules during early reperfusion after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A model using the filament method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and fluorescence microscopy was used to examine white-cell behavior and hemodynamics in the cerebral microcirculation after MCAO-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant increase in leukocyte rolling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in venules and a significant decrease in blood shear rate in the microcirculation of the brain during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes may activate and damage the blood vessels and surrounding brain cells, which contributes to an exaggerated inflammatory component to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The model described can be used to examine precisely blood cell-endothelium interactions and hemodynamic changes in the microcirculation during postischemic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Information from these and similar experiments may contribute to our understanding of the early <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the brain during reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
