<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Video camera technology has permitted imaging, through a window in the skull, of the phosphorescence of an oxygen probe, Pd meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8337">porphine</z:chebi>, bound to albumin in the blood of anesthetized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images of the phosphorescence taken at different times after the flash of excitation light were used to generate high-resolution two-dimensional maps of the oxygen pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These maps show that cortical oxygenation is spatially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and that there is dynamic time-dependent modulation of regional oxygen pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the middle cerebral artery was occluded, the region for which it supplied blood became hypoxic, the severity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> varying among animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Release after 60 min of occlusion resulted in a rapid rise of the oxygen pressure to above-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a delayed period of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This period is characterized by generally low tissue oxygen pressures with local regions of more severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delayed period of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> appears to result from damage to the microvasculature, and this microvascular damage is proposed to be an important determinant of the extent of irreversible brain damage </plain></SENT>
