<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors in mediating effects of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) on immediate early gene expression in the rat by quantitation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of MCAO on the induction of immediate early genes was studied in five regions, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the occlusion: the "core" ischemic area of the cortex in the central region of the middle cerebral artery territory, the surrounding area, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of c-fos, c-jun, zif-268, and krox-20 mRNA were measured by Northern and slot blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A large induction of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cortical regions ipsilateral to the occlusion, with the greatest effect detected in the core area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Little effect was detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contralateral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK-801 (3 mg/kg) largely inhibited the induction of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, indicating that the induction was mediated through an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> subtype of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCAO also produced a significant induction of c-jun and zif-268 mRNA in ipsilateral cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that MCAO causes a profound modulation of the expression of multiple genes in an extensive area of cerebral cortex extending beyond the immediate area supplied by the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The marked effect of MK-801 indicates the potential importance of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in restricting the widespread deleterious effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
