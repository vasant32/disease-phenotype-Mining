<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying hypothermic neuroprotection is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the induction of oxidative DNA damage, an early harmful event during post-ischemic reperfusion that triggers both necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the brain, was studied using the rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 2-hr MCAO and reperfusion of various durations up to 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) was induced at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and terminated at the beginning of reperfusion, and this significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 72 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlated with this protective effect, intraischemic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> markedly attenuated the nuclear accumulations of several oxidative DNA lesions, including 8-oxodG, AP sites, and DNA single-strand breaks, after 2-hr MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, harmful DNA damage-dependent signaling events, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, p53 activation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> translocation of PUMA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi>, were reduced during post-ischemic reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-treated brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the attenuation of oxidative DNA damage and DNA damage-triggered pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signaling events may be an important mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
