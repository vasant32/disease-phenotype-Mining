<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TGFβ is both neuroprotective and a key immune system modulator and is likely to be an important target for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise function of increased TGF-β1 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown and its pleiotropic nature means that it may convey a neuroprotective signal, orchestrate glial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> or function as an important immune system regulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the time course and cell-specificity of TGFβ signaling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and whether its signaling pattern is altered by gender and aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> on 5 and 18 month old TGFβ reporter mice to get a readout of TGFβ responses after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine which cell type is the source of increased TGFβ production after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, brain sections were stained with an anti-TGFβ antibody, colocalized with markers for reactive astrocytes, neurons, and activated microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine which cells are responding to TGFβ after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, brain sections were double-labelled with anti-pSmad2, a marker of TGFβ signaling, and markers of neurons, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TGFβ signaling increased 2 fold after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, beginning on day 1 and peaking on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern of increase was preserved in old animals and absolute TGFβ signaling in the brain increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activated microglia and macrophages were the predominant source of increased TGFβ after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and astrocytes and activated microglia and macrophages demonstrated dramatic upregulation of TGFβ signaling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TGFβ signaling in neurons and oligodendrocytes did not undergo marked changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that TGFβ signaling increases with age and that astrocytes and activated microglia and macrophages are the main cell types that undergo increased TGFβ signaling in response to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases in TGFβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore increased TGFβ after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> likely regulates glial scar formation and the immune response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
