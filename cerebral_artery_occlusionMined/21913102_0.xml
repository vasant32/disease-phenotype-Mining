<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, several animal models of focal and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been developed to mimic the clinical situation in humans as accurately as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This chapter focuses on models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, in particular on the most commonly used model: the intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main objective is to provide a detailed instruction manual for researchers interested in learning this technique </plain></SENT>
