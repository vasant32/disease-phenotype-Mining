<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>17-β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) is a steroid hormone involved in neuroprotection against excitotoxicity and other forms of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through genomic and nongenomic mechanisms, E2 modulates neuronal excitability and signal transmission by regulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms and identity of the receptors involved remain unclear, even though studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is linked to protection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the culture cortical neurons, treatment with E2 and the GPR30 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> G1 for 45 min attenuated the excitotoxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotection mediated by GPR30 is dependent on G-protein-coupled signals and ERK1/2 activation, but independent on transcription or translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of GPR30 using short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNAs) significantly reduced the E2-induced rapid neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp recordings revealed that GPR30 activation depressed exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-elicited currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term GPR30 activation did not affect the expression of either NR2A- or NR2B-containing NMDARs; however, it depressed NR2B subunit phosphorylation at Ser-1303 by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DAPK1 knockdown using shRNAs significantly blocked NR2B subunit phosphorylation at Ser-1303 and abolished the GPR30-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-elicited currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lateral ventricle injection of the GPR30 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> G1 (0.2 μg) provided significant neuroprotection in the ovariectomized female mice subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide direct evidence that fast neuroprotection by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> is partially mediated by GPR30 and the subsequent downregulation of NR2B-containing NMDARs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The modulation of DAPK1 activity by GPR30 may be an important mediator of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-dependent neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
