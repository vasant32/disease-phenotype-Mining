<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to investigate in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model the influence of 2APH, a competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on the cerebral blood flow of cat cortex, given intravenously before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four male cats weighing 2.5 to 3.5 kg were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and then randomly assigned to either control or experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the experimented group 18 cats were treated with 2APH and in the control group 16 cats were given saline 10 min before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow (CBF), determined by laser Doppler ultrasound flowmetry, was measured 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 5 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated by summing up the areas in each stained brain section after the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of cortex between the 2APH group and the saline control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we did notice an apparent decrease of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in basal ganglia area when 2APH was given (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly smaller in the group treated with 2APH after MCAO as compared with the saline control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data from the present experiment suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may not only antagonize the neurotoxic effect of excitatory amino acid on ischemic neuron but also improve the CBF of ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
