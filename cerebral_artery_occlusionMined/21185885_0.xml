<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although LA is neuroprotective in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, little is known about the cellular mechanisms by which it confers protection during the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we demonstrated that administration of LA 30 min prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamp techniques in rat brain slices were used to determine if LA causes any electrophysiological alterations in either healthy neurons or neurons exposed to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In healthy neurons, LA (0.005 mg/ml and 0.05 mg/ml) did not significantly change resting membrane potential, threshold or frequency of action potentials or synaptic transmission, as determined by amplitude of excitatory post synaptic currents (EPSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in neurons exposed to OGD, LA did not alter the time course to loss of EPSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant delay the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of anoxic depolarization as well as in the time course of the depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) levels were monitored in isolated neurons using fura-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 0.005 mg/ml and 0.05 mg/ml LA for 30 min and 6 h did not significantly alter resting Ca(2+) levels or Ca(2+) response to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (250 Î¼M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment with 0.5 mg/ml LA for 6 h significantly increased resting Ca(2+) levels and significantly decreased the Ca(2+) response to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, these findings suggest that LA does not affect neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, but can protect cells from an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
