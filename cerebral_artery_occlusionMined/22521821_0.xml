<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we assessed the effects of MMP-2 KO, MMP-9 KO and MMP-2/9 double KO (dKO) in protecting against mechanical reperfusion induced HT and other brain injuries after the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice of the same genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was performed in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was started at 1 or 1.5h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mice were sacrificed 8h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that both pro- and active MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were significantly elevated in the early ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, the hemorrhagic incidence was reduced in the cortex of MMP-2 KO mice (p&lt;0.05 vs. WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hemorrhagic volume was significantly decreased in the cortexes of MMP-2 and/or -9 knockout mice (MMP-9 KO vs. WT: p&lt;0.01, MMP-2 KO and dKO vs. WT: p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the basal ganglia, MMP-2 KO and MMP-2/9 dKO mice displayed a remarkable decrease in hemorrhagic volume (p&lt;0.01 or 0.05 vs. WT), but MMP-9 KOs did not protect against <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and/or -9 knockout mice displayed significantly decreased infarction volume in both the cortex and striatum, in addition to improved neurological function (p&lt;0.001 vs. WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that MMP-2 deficiency and MMP-2 and MMP-9 double deficiency were more protective than MMP-9 deficiency against HT after the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies increase our understanding of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HT development and will help to selectively target MMPs to protect the post-ischemic brain from injury and HT </plain></SENT>
