<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have evaluated the effects of PARP inhibitor, 8-hydroxy-2 methyl-quinazolin-4-[3H]one (NU1025) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> and 3-morphilinosyndonimine (SIN-1) induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells as well as in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of PC12 cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> (0.4 mM) and SIN-1 (0.8 mM) resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability after 6 h </plain></SENT>
