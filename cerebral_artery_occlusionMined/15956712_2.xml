<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relaxin (10 ng in 200 nL saline) or saline was injected into the secondary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after treatment, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded, causing ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 1-mm coronal sections were stained using 2-3-5-triphenoltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digital photographs were taken of the sections, and the ratio of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area to ipsilateral hemispheric area was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relaxin treatment significantly (P &lt; .05) reduced this ratio compared with that of saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that relaxin may prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
