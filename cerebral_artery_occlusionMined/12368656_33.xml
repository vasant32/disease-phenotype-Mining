<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) and caudate-putamen (CP) infarctions were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End-ischemic and early reperfusion regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by [ C]-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiography in vehicle- or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg)-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction (% contralateral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) was 31 +/- 30% (vehicle), 39 +/- 23% (P5), 41 +/- 14% (P10), and 28 +/- 20% (P20) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vehicle and P5R groups, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> infarction was 37 +/- 20% and *20 +/- 17%, respectively (* &lt; 0.05 from vehicle) </plain></SENT>
