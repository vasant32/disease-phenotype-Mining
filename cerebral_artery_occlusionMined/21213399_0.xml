<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg/day for seven days) by intragastric administration modulated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and protein synthesis of two neurotrophic factors: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> was effective in stimulating BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and protein synthesis in the ipsilateral frontal cortex (IFC) of both the sham-operated and pMCAO rats and this effect was also observed in the hippocampus of the pMCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> significantly increased NT-3 mRNA expression and protein synthesis in the IFC and hippocampus of the pMCAO rats, although it had no effect on NT-3 expression in the sham-operated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> also decreased the malondialdehyde contents in the hippocampus of the sham-operated and pMCAO groups, and significantly attenuated the decrease of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and catalase) activities in both the IFC and hippocampus of the rats after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> insult injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> facilitated the neurobehavioral recovery after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that <z:chebi fb="121" ids="42263">DME</z:chebi> has potential for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage through stimulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity and neurotrophic factor synthesis </plain></SENT>
