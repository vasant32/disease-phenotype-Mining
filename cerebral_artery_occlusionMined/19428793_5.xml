<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study applied proteomics to investigate the different protein expression modes in mice brains after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with or without administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four proteins which had a 3-fold change in abundance compared to the sham control sample were selected to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference in expression between the twenty-four proteins <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi>-treated MCAO group and the sham-operation group (n=24, p=0.102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene Ontology analysis linked these proteins to fifteen biological processes, including cellular process, developmental process and biological regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> performed well in regulating proteins in energy metabolism but had a relatively weak effect in the regulation of proteins in neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In sum, our findings suggest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> may be a potential therapeutic agent in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may also be a strong candidate for future research in its actions on individual proteins </plain></SENT>
