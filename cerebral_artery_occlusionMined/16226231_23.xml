<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (EP) is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> derivative, and has recently been reported to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> in mice with established lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we reported that EP has a neuroprotective effect in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), in which it was found to be effective when injected as late as 12 h after MCAO/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that therapeutic window of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> in this MCAO animal model is limited to 1 h (30 min before and 30 min after MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and EP have a neuroprotective effect during oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> challenge in primary cortical culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, EP suppressed the LPS-induced activation of primary microglia in culture, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The suppression of microglia activation was evidenced by a reduction in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> release and by a proinflammatory factor induction in primary microglia culture, which were accompanied by the repression of nuclear factor-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EP has a strong protective effect and a wide therapeutic window, and that this protective effect of EP is related to its anti-inflammatory action </plain></SENT>
