<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrates have been shown to attenuate brain tissue injury after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and PPARalpha-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated for 7 days with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> and subjected to 2 h of filamentous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical surface CBF was measured by laser speckle imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF (rCBF) in nonischemic animals was measured by (14)C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> did not affect rCBF and mean arterial blood pressure in nonischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ischemic animals, laser speckle imaging showed delayed expansions of ischemic area, which was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">Fenofibrate</z:chebi> also enhanced CBF recovery after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, such effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> on CBF in the ischemic brain were not observed in PPARalpha-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> improves CBF in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> requires PPARalpha expression for the cerebrovascular protective effects in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
