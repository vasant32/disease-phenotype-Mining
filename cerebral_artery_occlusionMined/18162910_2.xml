<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, a potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, also possesses anti-inflammatory properties that diminish postreperfusion damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the potential for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to induce hemorrhagic transformation of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> has deterred its use in cases of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether or not administration of a novel O-desulfated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (ODSH), with significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity but active anti-inflammatory effects, would ameliorate inflammatory neurological injury without increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were injected immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with phosphate-buffered saline or ODSH (5 mg/kg, intravenously) and then every 12 hours (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were assessed for neurological function using a foot fault test and modified Bederson scale on Days 1, 2, and 5; plasma samples were analyzed for activated clotting time at multiple time points after the initial ODSH dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice on Day 5, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined and brain tissue was examined for evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> both grossly and using a previously validated spectrophotometric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ODSH-treated animals demonstrated significantly improved foot fault performance (P = 0.03) on Day 5 and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes (P = 0.03) relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the brains of ODSH-treated rats exhibited significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in a standardized assay (P = 0.01), there were no incidences of gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> observed in either group, and activated clotting time measurements for the treated animals were not significantly elevated over baseline at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that ODSH can be administered at a dose that provides postischemic anti-inflammatory neuroprotection without an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
