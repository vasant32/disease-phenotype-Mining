<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that tPA treatment would augment ischemic injury by causing increased blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown as determined by quantitative serial T(1) and T(2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the transfer constant for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">diethylenetriamine</z:chebi> penta-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) from blood to brain in aged (18 to 20 months) compared with young (3 to 4 months) Wistar rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mediated through the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disassembly of claudin 5 and occludin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased T(2) values over the first hour of postreperfusion were independently augmented following treatment with tPA (P&lt;0.001) and aging (P&lt;0.01), supporting a synergistic effect of tPA on the aged ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier permeability for Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> (K(Gd)) was substantial following reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animal groups and was exacerbated by tPA treatment in the elderly rat (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation was proportionately increased in the elderly ischemic brain (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both tPA and age independently increased claudin 5 and occludin phosphorylation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability detected by quantitative MRI following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is enhanced by increased age and tPA and is related to claudin 5 and occludin phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
