<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of PACAP as a clinically efficient drug is limited by its poor metabolic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By combining identification of enzymatic cleavage sites with targeted chemical modifications, a metabolically stable and potent PACAP38 analog was recently developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective activity of this novel compound was for the first time evaluated and compared to the native <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> using a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that as low as picomolar doses of PACAP38 and its analog strongly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve neurological impairment induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> inhibit the expression of Bcl-2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> promoter, caspase 3, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, and increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023434" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BCLL">B-cell CLL</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 and interleukin 6 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of PACAP after MCAO is not only due to its ability to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> but also to modulate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of very low concentrations of PACAP or its metabolically stable derivative for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
