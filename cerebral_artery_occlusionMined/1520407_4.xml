<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following 6 h of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rat brains were frozen in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral ischemic zone, total PKC activity declined by close to two-thirds (1.07 +/- 0.35 vs 2.77 +/- 0.12 nmol/min/mg protein; p less than 0.05, n = 4), and the proportion of total activity associated with the particulate fraction decreased from 33.3 +/- 1.5% to 16.2 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.01, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, overall particulate PKC activity in the ischemic zone was less than 20% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral energy metabolite profile of tissue from the ipsilateral hemisphere, corresponding to the region where samples were obtained for PKC activity assay, suggests that this tissue may have been part of the ischemic penumbra before further deterioration </plain></SENT>
