<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Metallothioneins (MTs) are metal-binding proteins and have four isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MT-III was, at first, found in the brains of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MT-III exists mainly in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and the main effects are thought to be anti-oxidative and regulate zinc levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some previous reports, MT-III exhibited neuroprotective effects in various pathological situations, but its detailed effects are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined neuronal damage after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in MT-III knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the relationship between MT-III and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after 24-h permanent MCAO between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and MT-III KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, after 2-h MCAO and 22-h reperfusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the MT-III KO mice was aggravated compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fatal rate of MT-III KO mice increased from 3 days after MCAO, and neurological deficits at 5 and 7 days after MCAO of MT-III KO mice were worse than those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We examined terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and the immunostaining of an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), at 24 h after transient MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra lesion, the positive cell numbers in both staining assays were higher in the MT-III KO mice than those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that neuronal damage was aggravated by reperfusion injury in the MT-III KO mice compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, suggesting that MT-III plays anti-oxidative and neuroprotective roles in transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
