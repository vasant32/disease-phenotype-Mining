<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Premenopausal women are at lower risk than men for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the comparative vulnerability to tissue injury once a cerebrovascular incident occurs is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that female rats sustain less brain damage than males during experimental focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and that the gender difference in ischemic outcome can be eliminated by ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age-matched male (M), intact female (F), and ovariectomized female (O; plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>: 4.1+/-1.6 pg/mL compared with 7.4+/-1.5 in F and 4.0+/-1.1 in M) rats from two different strains, normotensive Wistar and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, were subjected to 2 hours of intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored throughout the ischemic period by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume in the cerebral cortex (Ctx) and caudoputamen (CP) was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort of M, F, and O Wistar rats, absolute rates of regional CBF were measured at the end of the ischemic period by quantitative autoradiography using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: F rats of either strain had a smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in Ctx and CP and a higher laser-Doppler flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with respective M and O rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean end-ischemic CBF was higher in F compared with M and O rats in CP, but not in Ctx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrocortical tissue volume with end-ischemic CBF &lt; 10 mL/100 g/min was smaller in F than M rats, but not different from O rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> by exerting both neuroprotective and flow-preserving effects </plain></SENT>
