<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endothelium-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) plays a pivotal role in vascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil, prevents the downregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether inhibition of ROCK can attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and tissue damage in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human vascular endothelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of hydroxyfasudil (0.1 to 100 micromol/L) and eNOS expression and activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the physiological relevance of eNOS regulation by ROCK, we administered fasudil, which is metabolized to hydroxyfasudil in vivo, to mice for 2 days before subjecting them to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and neurologic deficit were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a concentration-dependent manner, hydroxyfasudil increased eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, resulting in a 1.9- and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, at 10 micromol/L (P&lt;0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This correlated with a 1.5- and 2.3-fold increase in eNOS activity and NO production, respectively (P&lt;0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fasudil increased cerebral blood flow to both ischemic and nonischemic brain areas, reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 33%, and improved neurologic deficit score by 37% (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This correlated with inhibition of brain and vascular ROCK activity and increased eNOS expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, also showed similar effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of fasudil were absent in eNOS-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effect of ROCK inhibition is mediated by endothelium-derived NO and suggest that ROCK may be an important therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
