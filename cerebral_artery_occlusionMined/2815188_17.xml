<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of its effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated the effect of nimodipine, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on changes in cytosolic free calcium, cortical blood flow, and histologic changes following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion in 14 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52084">indo-1</z:chebi>, a fluorescent intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> indicator, we simultaneously measured changes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signal ratio (400:506 nm), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi> fluorescence (464 nm), and reflectance (340 nm) during an ultraviolet excitation (340 nm) directly from the cat cortex in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In six cats treated with vehicle only, the calcium signal ratio increased from 5 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to 30 minutes into reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevation of cytosolic free calcium was significantly attenuated by nimodipine, which was administered by intravenous infusion in eight cats starting 5 minutes after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine had no effect on cortical blood flow during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but induced a hyperperfused state following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine did not modify changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidation-reduction state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine proved to have beneficial effects on recovery of the electroencephalogram following reperfusion as well as on the extent of focal histologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that nimodipine, when administered during the early stage of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, can favorably modify the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by reducing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry during both the ischemic and reperfusion periods </plain></SENT>
