<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17295,29997">L-Phenylalanine</z:chebi> (L-Phe) significantly and reversibly depresses excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission (GST) via a unique set of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that endogenous derivatives of L-Phe, which display potent antiglutamatergic activity, may safely and efficaciously protect the brain during conditions characterized by overactivation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested this hypothesis in vitro with a combination of patch-clamp and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) analyses in rat cultured neurons exposed to simulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and in vivo using a rat model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15768">3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15768">DIT</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28335">3,5-dibromo-L-tyrosine</z:chebi> (DBrT), endogenous halogenated derivatives of L-Phe, attenuated GST by similar mechanisms as L-Phe, but with greater potency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, the IC50s for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15768">DIT</z:chebi> and DBrT to depress the frequency of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30768">propionic acid</z:chebi> (AMPA)/kainate receptor-mediated mEPSCs were 104.6+/-14.1 micromol/L and 127.5+/-13.3 micromol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> of GST by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15768">DIT</z:chebi> and DBrT persisted during energy deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DBrT significantly reduced LDH release in neuronal cultures exposed to oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In rats subjected to transient MCAO, DBrT decreased the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit score to 52.7+/-14.1% and 57.1+/-12.0% of control values, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DBrT neither altered atrioventricular nodal and intraventricular conduction in isolated heart, nor heart rate and blood pressure in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DBrT, an endogenous halogenated derivative of L-Phe, shows promise as a representative of a novel class of neuroprotective agents by exerting significant neuroprotection in both in vitro and in vivo models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
