<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of intracerebral injection of LIF after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals underwent a sham operation (sham group) or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by direct injection of either vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, the PBS group) or recombinant LIF (10 ng in the low-LIF group and 100 ng in the high-LIF group) into the cerebral cortex adjacent to the inner boundary zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, and neurologic and histologic evaluations were conducted 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of LIFR, gp130, and phosphorylated Stat3, Akt, and ERK1/2 was investigated by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficits and ischemic damage were significantly less severe in the high-LIF group than in the PBS group and the low-LIF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor receptor and gp130 were expressed in neurons, and the ischemic damage of these proteins was rescued in the high-LIF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early induction of phosphorylated Stat3 was significantly detected on the ischemic side in the high-LIF group after LIF injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous LIF attenuates ischemic brain injury by activating cytokine signaling through LIFR/gp130 </plain></SENT>
