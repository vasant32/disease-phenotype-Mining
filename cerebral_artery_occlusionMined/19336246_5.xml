<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that the Notch signaling pathway fulfills important roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-stimulated neurogenesis, which may be regarded as an etiological factor in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we explored Notch(1) signaling, hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) in adult ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by an 18 day CUMS procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cells in the hippocampus and their cell fate were investigated on days 19 and 28 after ischemic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, expression of the Notch(1) intracellular domain (NICD) and its downstream targets Hes1 and Hes5 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> preference test and forced swim test were used to assess behavioral responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CUMS produced depressive-like behaviors and decreased the number of proliferating cells on day 19 (both p&lt;0.001), accompanied by a decreased expression of both Hes1 and Hes5 in the hippocampus of ischemic animals (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 28, CUMS resulted in a decreased number of neurogenically-differentiating cells in the subgranular zone (p&lt;0.001) while permitting differentiation into astrocytes in the hilus (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hes1 and Hes5 protein expression levels were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of the NICD was significantly decreased at both time-points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CUMS led to expression changes in the Notch(1) signaling cascade in ischemic rats, most of which concerned hippocampal neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that variation in Notch(1) activity and subsequent expression of its downstream targets, including Hes1 and Hes5, may, at least in part, contribute to modulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related hippocampal neurogenesis by CUMS </plain></SENT>
