<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, spatiotemporal differences in ApoE expression and its long-term role in neural process after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated changes of ApoE immunoreactivity and ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression both in the core and in the periischemic area at 1, 7, 21, or 56 days after 90 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double stainings for ApoE plus NeuN or plus ED1 were performed in order to identify cell type of ApoE-positive stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal increase of ApoE expression was observed at 7 days in the core and at 7 and 21 days in the periischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the core, ApoE plus NeuN double-positive cells increased at 1 and 7 days, without ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, whereas they increased in the periischemic area, with a peak at 21 days, with ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in glial cells but not in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, ApoE plus ED1 double-positive cells increased only in the core, with a peak in number at 7 and 21 days and marked ApoE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that ApoE plays various important roles in different type of cells, reflecting spatiotemporal dissociation between degenerative and regenerative processes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and that ApoE is profoundly involved in pathological conditions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
