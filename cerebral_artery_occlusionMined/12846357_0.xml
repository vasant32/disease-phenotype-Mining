<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the wide availability of CT it is useful to illustrate the radiological spectrum of findings following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is pictorial study of four prototypic patients with hyperdense middle cerebral artery which was the common denominator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a marked heterogeniety among the patients in relation to the character of the vascular disturbances, location, extent of ischaemic changes and the final outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We emphasise that a single radiological sign should be seen in the context of the entire scan </plain></SENT>
