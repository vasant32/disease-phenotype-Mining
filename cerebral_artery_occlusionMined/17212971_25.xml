<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying the molecules that play important roles in the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, we developed a multi-channel computer-controlled system, in which the brain temperatures of freely moving rats were telemetrically monitored and maintained below 35 degrees C, and examined the time window necessary to exert its significant neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old SD rats were subjected to a 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with an intraluminal filament, and post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was introduced at 0, 2, 4, or 6h after reperfusion until the rats were killed 2 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since a significant protection was observed when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was started within 4h after reperfusion, it was concluded that the therapeutic time window of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> lasts for 4h after reperfusion in our model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the window, comprehensive gene expression analyses using oligonucleotide microarrays were conducted and identified potential genes related to the efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, which included inflammatory genes like osteopontin, early growth response-1, or macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of post-ischemic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> were strongly suggested to be mainly associated with the reduction of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
