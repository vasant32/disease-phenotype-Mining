<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by modulation of AQP4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham surgery (n = 6), or a continuous intravenous infusion of vehicle (1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi>), followed by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 18), and administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> at 50 microg/kg (n = 6) or at 200 microg/kg (n = 6) starting 60 min before or 30 min (200 microg/kg; n = 6) or 60 min (200 microg/kg; n = 6) after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was monitored with laser Doppler over the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and confirmed a 70% reduction during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 2-h period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 2 h of reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed for assessment of brain water content and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AQP4 expression was assessed by immunoblotting and quantified by densitometry (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> treatment at 200 microg/kg significantly reduced brain water concentration in the infarcted area when started 60 min before or 30 min after occlusion (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively), and prevented the subsequent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> shift (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> normalized the AQP4 upregulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A downregulation of AQP4 in the ischemic area paralleling the reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> treatment suggests that the effect was mediated by AQP4 modulation </plain></SENT>
