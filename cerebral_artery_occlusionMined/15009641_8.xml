<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to reveal the mechanism of herbal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> recipes retrieving deficient ability of spatial learning memory in mice suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion, a microarray system was used to analyze gene expression in those groups with increasing ability of spatial learning memory who were different from ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we reported a comprehensive characterization of gene expression profiles of mouse hippocampus by the use of cDNA microarray system containing 1176 known genes in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) ischemic mice after treating with different dosage recipes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> herbs (30, 90, and 270 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of spatial learning memory in ischemic mice was found to be decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in ischemic mouse brain showed that a complex related to 100 genes' expression yielded 1.8-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-dependent effects showed an improvement in the deficient ability and reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> recipes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many genes (38-46) in expression were found greater than 1.8-fold in those effective recipes groups, including genes in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, nerve system transcription factors, DNA binding protein, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine genes related to retrieving deficient ability of spatial learning memory treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> recipes were also found in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that microarray analysis of gene expression might be useful for elucidating the mechanisms of pharmacological function of recipes </plain></SENT>
