<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we probed the putative causal relationship between enhanced astrocytic activation and exacerbation of brain damage in 4/4-KI mice using arundic acid (ONO-2506, Ono Pharmaceutical Co </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ltd), which is known to oppose astrocytic activation through its inhibitory action on S100B synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the KI mice, administration of arundic acid (10 mg/kg day, intraperitoneal, started immediately after pMCAO) induced significant amelioration of brain damage at 5 days after pMCAO in terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (results expressed as the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (mm(3)) +/-1s.d. in 2/2-, 3/3-, or 4/4-KI mice in the vehicle groups: 16 +/- 2, 15 +/- 2, or 22 +/- 2; in the arundic acid groups: 11 +/- 2 (P &lt; 0.001), 11 +/- 2 (P &lt; 0.001), or 12 +/- 2 (P &lt; 0.001), as compared with the vehicle groups), neurologic deficits, and S100/glial fibrillary acidic protein burden in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of arundic acid were most pronounced in 4/4-KI mice, wherein delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion together with deterioration of neurologic deficits was almost completely mitigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above results support the notion that the apoE4 isoform exacerbates brain damage during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of pMCAO through augmentation of astrocytic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, pharmacological modulation of astrocytic activation may confer a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain damage, particularly in APOE epsilon4 carriers </plain></SENT>
