<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the mouse brain cortex proteome from different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> sets: transient (7 min) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (7'MCAo, pre-conditioning stimulus), permanent MCAo (pMCAo, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), and pMCAo 4 days after 7'MCAo (7'MCAo/pMCAo, pre-conditioned model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 28 proteins were expressed differentially from sham controls, and identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic pre-conditioning stimulus alone up-regulated the stress protein heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), possibly activated by the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting confirmed the increased expression of HSP70 and showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor expression paralleled that of HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic-tolerant group (7'MCAo/pMCAo), a number of proteins over-expressed after pMCAo returned to sham levels, seven proteins remained up-regulated as in pMCAo, and five proteins mainly involved in energy metabolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> electron transport and unchanged in pMCAo were down-regulated only in ischemic tolerance, suggesting a role in brain pre-conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes participated in ischemic-tolerance induction, as shown by the down-regulation of glutamine synthetase in the 7'MCAo/pMCAo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that metabolic down-regulation was a general feature of ischemic pre-conditioning, playing a pivotal role in neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
