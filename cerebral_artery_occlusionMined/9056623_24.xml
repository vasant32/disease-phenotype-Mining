<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because in humans the clinical benefits of reperfusion remain controversial, it is important to determine whether reperfusion per se reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the nonhuman primate, mostly semiquantitative assessments of infarction have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When ischemic volumes have been calculated, it has been for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may thus not adequately reflect the total volume of consolidated infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anesthetized baboons were subjected to 6 hours of either reversible or permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4 weeks later, the brains were processed for neuropathological examination to allow assessment of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume determined by the difference of healthy tissue between occluded and nonoccluded hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reversible MCAO resulted in a small essentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> (mean+/-SD, 0.58+/-0.31 cm3) in 6 of 10 baboons: the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (pannecrosis) was restricted to the head of the caudate nucleus, internal capsule, and putamen; 4 of 10 baboons showed no evidence of macroscopic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Permanent MCAO produced a larger subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 baboons studied (2.37+/-1.32 cm3; P=.0006 by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test); the lesion was more extensive and encompassed the external capsule and, in 2 baboons, the adjacent insular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that under optimal experimental conditions, an ischemic episode of 6 hours in duration is well tolerated in the anesthetized adolescent baboon, with 4 animals showing no signs of macroscopic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, early reestablishment of cerebral blood flow after a focal ischemic insult is not detrimental but indeed is beneficial in terms of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (both at the subcortical and cortical levels) produced by occlusion of a major cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data further suggest a feasible time window in which to initiate and continue therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
