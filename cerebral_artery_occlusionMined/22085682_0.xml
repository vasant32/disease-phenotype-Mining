<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi>, a major bioactive compound extracted from Sedum sarmentosum Bunge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> on a cultured neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y in vitro and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated SH-SY5Y cell line in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo experiment, rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MACO) for 1h, then followed by reperfusion for 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> reduced the OGD-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cytotoxicity, blocked TNF-α-induced NF-κB and IκB-α phosphorylation, and decreased HMGB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At doses higher than 50mg/kg, Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> produced a significant neuroprotective potential in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> (100mg/kg) demonstrated significant neuroprotective activity even after delayed administration at 2h and 4h after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> 100mg/kg attenuated histopathological damage, decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, inhibited NF-κB activation and reduced HMGB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that Tricin 7-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> protects brain against I/R injury with a favorable therapeutic time-window by alleviating cerebral I/R injury and attenuating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown, and its protective effects may involve HMGB1 and NF-κB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
