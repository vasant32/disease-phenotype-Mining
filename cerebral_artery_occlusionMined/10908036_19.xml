<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that overexpression of bcl-2 in transgenic mice or by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors protects the brain against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether bcl-2, which is endogenously expressed in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, exerts a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, the authors blocked the endogenous expression of bcl-2 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antisense, sense, scrambled ODN, or vehicles were infused in the lateral ventricle of the rat for 24 hours after 30 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later the brains were removed and bcl-2 protein expression was assayed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antisense ODN, but not sense or scrambled ODN treatment, significantly inhibited bcl-2 protein expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein expression was also studied 24 hours after 60 minutes of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in vehicle and antisense ODN-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and vehicle treatment, bcl-2 was expressed in many neurons in the ventral cortical mantle and the medial striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After antisense ODN treatment there were few neurons in this region expressing bcl-2, instead most neurons TUNEL labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the antisense ODN, but not sense ODN, increased infarction volume as determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that endogenously expressed bcl-2 promoted survival in ischemic neurons and was not simply an epiphenomenon in neurons already destined to live or die </plain></SENT>
