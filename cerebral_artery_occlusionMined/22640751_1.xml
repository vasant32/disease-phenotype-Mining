<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current work compares sensorimotor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats following a transient 90- or 120-min MCAO, which allows the appropriate behavioural tests to be chosen based on the goal and design of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the beam-walking test, we found significant differences between the 90- and 120-min MCAO groups in the number of foot faults made with the impaired hindlimb on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> days 3, 7 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cylinder test, a difference between the 90- and 120-min groups was observed on post-operation day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The responses to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation were impaired to a similar extent after 90- and 120-min MCAO in the vibrissae-evoked forelimb-placing and limb-placing tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in the 120-min MCAO group 6 days after the acquisition trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain tissue damage was significantly higher after 120-min occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> compared with 90-min occlusion; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 13% and 25% of the contralateral hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both the 90- and 120-min occlusion models result in a significant impairment of sensorimotor, tactile and proprioceptive function, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> is only observed in the 120-min MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beam-walking and cylinder tests detected neurological dysfunction after the 120-min MCAO, whereas the limb-placing and vibrissae-evoked forelimb-placing tests were able to evaluate the neurological dysfunction in rats after 90- and 120-min MCAO </plain></SENT>
