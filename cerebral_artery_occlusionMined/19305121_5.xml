<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> triggers an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that not only plays a central role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but also induces secondary damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> extract of PN on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (90-min occlusion and 24-h reperfusion) in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PN extract (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PN-treated groups had a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 23.82 +/- 8.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the PN extract-treated groups, the microglial density was significantly decreased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region; the underlying mechanism was inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, such as inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, via blocking of the NF-kappaB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that the PN extract significantly reduced the production of iNOS-derived NO and COX-2-derived <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) through the regulation of gene transcription levels in primary microglia and BV-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-inflammatory and microglial activation inhibitory effects of the PN extract may contribute to its neuroprotective effects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
