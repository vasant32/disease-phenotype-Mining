<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> could reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficit scores compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/day) were abolished by PD123319 (an AT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, 10 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT1 receptor gene expression was downregulated while AT2 receptor gene expression was upregulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> appears to provide beneficial effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in spontaneous hypertensive rats in three ways: AT1 receptor antagonism, downregulation of AT1 receptor expression and upregulation of AT2 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
