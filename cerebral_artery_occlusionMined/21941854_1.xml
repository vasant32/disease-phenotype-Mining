<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated expression profiles of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and corresponding proteins for different subunits of NMDAR and non-NMDAR in brains of rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular vitality was markedly reduced in proportion to increasing durations of MCAO for 1 to 8 h when determined 1 day after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 7 days after reperfusion, MCAO for 2 h led to a gradual decrease in the neuronal marker microtubules-associated protein-2 (MAP2) level in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, in addition to inducing a transient increase in the microglial marker CD11b expression without affecting the astroglial marker protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO for 2 h significantly decreased the expression of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and corresponding proteins for NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDAR, but not for non-NMDAR subunits, in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NMDAR may be preferentially down-regulated in response to ischemic signal inputs amongst three different subtypes of ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors in rats with MCAO </plain></SENT>
