<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Gene expression for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands and receptors was analyzed with in situ hybridization after two focal ischemic insults of different severities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in rats by either 30 min or 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), causing damage to the striatum only, or involving also the parietal cortex, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found modest, transient elevation of GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the dentate granule cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of GDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing cells increased in the cortex and striatum after 2 h or 30 min of MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No changes of neurturin or persephin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both c-Ret and GFRalpha1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were markedly increased in the ipsilateral cortex outside the ischemic lesion at 6-24 h after the 2-h insult, whereas GFRalpha2 expression was decreased in cortical areas both within and outside the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar increases of c-Ret and GFRalpha1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were detected in the striatum, and to a lesser extent, in the cortex following 30 min of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-h insult also gave rise to transient increases of c-Ret and GFRalpha1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in hippocampal subregions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes and 2 h of MCAO lead to elevated c-Ret, and GFRalpha1 or GFRalpha2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, respectively, in the ipsilateral ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both insults induced increased levels of GFRalpha1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate major changes of GDNF family signaling in the forebrain, regulated mainly through altered receptor levels, in the post-ischemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These changes could enhance neuroprotective and neuroregenerative responses both to endogenous and exogenous GDNF ligands </plain></SENT>
