<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">Eicosanoids</z:chebi> with vasoconstrictor properties, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (TxA2), may worsen postischemic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) on brain TxB2 (the stable metabolite of TxA2) was evaluated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis probes were placed in the caudate nucleus and temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each rat underwent one of the following ischemic regimens: groups I, II, and III--MCAo was maintained for 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively, followed by 120 min of reperfusion; group IV--a sham group in which MCAo and reperfusion were simulated; group V--7 h of MCAo only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dialysate was measured for TxB2 by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain levels of TxB2 did not deviate from baseline during MCAo (or in the sham group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during reperfusion, there was a significant increase in TxB2 following 180 min of MCAo but not after 60 or 120 min or MCAo (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that, in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, TxB2 does not increase during MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, following a threshold duration of MCAo (180 min), the vasoconstrictor TxB2 may modulate postischemic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications in the pharmacologic treatment of postischemic hypoperfusion and reperfusion brain injury </plain></SENT>
