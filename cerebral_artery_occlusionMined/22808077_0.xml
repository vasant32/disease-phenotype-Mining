<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnolol or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally, at 1 hr pre-insult or 1-6 hrs post-insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was measured upon sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, animals pre-treated with magnolol (50-200 mg/kg) had significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reductions by 30.9-37.8% and improved neurobehavioral outcomes (P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment with magnolol (100 mg/kg) also protected against ischemic brain damage and improved neurobehavioral scores, even when administered up to 4 hrs post-insult (P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, magnolol (0.1 µM) effectively attenuated the rises of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, [Ca(2+)](i), in cultured neurons exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, magnolol (0.1-1 µM) significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity and cell swelling (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, magnolol offers neuroprotection against permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with a therapeutic window of 4 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection may be, partly, mediated by its ability to limit the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
