<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One hundred and twenty rats were randomly divided into three CVB-D groups (2, 1, 0.5 mg x kg(-1)), Nimodipine group (2 mg x kg(-1)), model group and sham operated group, 20 rats each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury model was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the nerve injury symptoms was evaluated, the level of SOD and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in brain tissue were determined, the concentration of intracellar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> of brain was measured, and the pathological change of brain was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: CVB-D could improve the nerve injury symptoms, reduce the infarction area of brain, the concentration of intracellar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and the level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, increase the activity of SOD, and decrease the pathological change of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CVB-D has protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
