<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the efficacy of hUTC in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and whether multiple injections of hUTC provide additional therapeutic benefits as compared to a single injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and randomly selected animals were injected (i.v) with 3×10(6) hUTC or with vehicle control (at day: 1, 1&amp;3 or 1&amp;7 after MCAo, n = 8-9/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of functional outcome tests was performed at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63 after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed at 63 days after MCAo and lesion volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the underlying mechanism of hUTC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Von Willebrand</z:e> Factor (vWF), and Synaptophysin immunostaining were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hUTC treated groups, single or multiple injections, had better functional recovery compared to control (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between a single and multiple injections of hUTC (p = 0.23) or between different multiple injections groups (p&gt;0.07) in functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hUTC treatment groups showed significant increases in Synaptophysin, vascular density and perimeter compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between a single and multiple injections of hUTC or between the two groups of multiple injections in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunohistochemical measurements (p&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: hUTC treatment significantly improves long term functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and promotes vascular density and synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the proscribed doses, multiple injections of hUTC were not superior to single injection therapy in both functional outcome and histological assessments </plain></SENT>
