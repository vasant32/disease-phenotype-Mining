<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whereas most animal studies have used global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models, most neurosurgical procedures are associated with risks of focal rather than global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the effects of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration in an animal model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We anesthetized 20 cats with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (0.85% end tidal in oxygen), and a focal cerebral ischemic lesion was produced by clip ligation of the left middle cerebral artery using a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total fluid administered, mean arterial blood pressure, body temperature, and arterial blood gas values did not differ between the two groups 0, 2, and 6 hours after ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cats were killed 6 hours after ligation, and the area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was determined by microscopic examination of a coronal section at the level of the optic chiasm </plain></SENT>
