<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> cotransporter is stimulated by the ischemic factors <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, aglycemia, and arginine vasopressin (AVP), although the mechanisms responsible are not well understood </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the AMPK inhibitor Compound C significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in mouse MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the possibility that AMPK participates in ischemic factor-induced stimulation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na-K-Cl cotransporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) were assessed for Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity as bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AMPK activity was assessed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence methods using antibodies that detect total versus phosphorylated (activated) AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (7% and 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>), aglycemia, AVP, and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (5- to 120-min exposures) increase activation of AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that Compound C inhibition of AMPK reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-, aglycemia-, and AVP-induced stimulation of CMEC Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confocal immunofluorescence of perfusion-fixed rat brain slices revealed the presence of AMPK, both total and phosphorylated kinase, in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in situ of both control and ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ischemic factor stimulation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> Na-K-Cl cotransporter involves activation of AMPK </plain></SENT>
