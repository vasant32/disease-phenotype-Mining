<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a collaborative approach, our groups examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi>) in response to ischemic reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a dose-dependent manner when given systemically either immediately before or 30 min, but not 60 min, after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the 5.5-hr reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 24 hr of reperfusion when administered 5 min before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis did not reveal any significant changes either in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (GRP 78 and 94) or <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 70 or in levels of m-calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) significantly increased production of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the primary astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> did not alter ROS or IL-8 production when given to the astrocytes before OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> when added to the cells prior to or 30 min after reperfusion significantly reduced IL-8 release but not ROS formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed a dose- and time-dependent protective effect of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> on reperfusion injury in vitro and vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which <z:chebi fb="16" ids="16750">Guo</z:chebi> exerts its effect are independent of unfolded proteins in ER or the level of intracellular calcium or ROS formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the effect may be induced, at least partially, by inhibiting IL-8, a marker of reperfusion-triggered proinflammatory events. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
