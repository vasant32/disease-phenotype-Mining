<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ligands for cerebral <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors were used in the past to indicate the intactness of cortical neurons in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> states after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and thus to differentiate among brain regions with complete or incomplete infarction and with functional deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For planning <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> interventional therapy, however, a marker of irreversible damage in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the applicability of [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ) for differentiation between tissue with and without potential of recovery in the first hours after focal experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 11 cats, cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction, and FMZ binding were studied repeatedly by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography before, during, and up to 12 hours after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) (30 minutes in 2, 60 minutes in 7, and 120 minutes in 2 cats, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of the defects in energy metabolism were compared with the defects in FMZ binding (2 to 3 hours and 8 to 9 hours after MCAO), with the pattern of disturbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (determined 12 hours after MCAO), and with the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (determined approximately 15 hours after MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irrespective of the level of reperfusion, defects in FMZ binding (2 to 3 hours after MCAO) were closely related to areas with severely depressed oxygen consumption and predicted the size of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whereas preserved FMZ binding indicated intact cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals larger than the defects in FMZ binding and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, indicating functional deactivation of brain areas beyond the permanent morphological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, FMZ distribution within 2 minutes after injection was significantly correlated to flow and yielded reliable perfusion images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of FMZ binding early after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reflects irreversible neuronal damage that otherwise only can be detected by multitracer studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experimental data and first clinical applications suggest that FMZ has potential as an indicator of developing infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since FMZ distribution additionally images perfusion, this tracer might be useful for the selection of patients who would benefit from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
