<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To enhance our understanding of the relation between ischemic cell damage and 72-kd heat-shock protein expression, we evaluated the cellular expression and the anatomic distribution of 72-kd heat-shock protein in conjunction with the morphological analysis of rat brain, as a function of the duration of a single <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were subjected to graded transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (for a duration of 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and sham; n = 4 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after reopening the artery, brain tissue sections were analyzed to determine the extent of neuronal damage (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining), the extent of astrocytic reactivity (immunohistochemistry, using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein), and the distribution of 72-kd heat-shock protein (immunohistochemistry, using a monoclonal antibody to 72-kd heat-shock protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 72-kd heat-shock protein was sequentially expressed in morphologically intact neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells with increasing duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; 72-kd heat-shock protein immunoreactivity was not detected in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> required to evoke a 72-kd heat-shock protein response in neurons was dependent on the anatomic site and followed a pattern of increasing neuronal sensitivity to ischemic cell damage with duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>: 72-kd heat-shock protein and neuronal damage were sequentially detected in the caudate putamen, globus pallidus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus with increasing duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of long duration (greater than or equal to 90 minutes), neurons expressing 72-kd heat-shock protein were localized to a zone peripheral to the severely damaged ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that 1) the expression of 72-kd heat-shock protein in neurons precedes the development of ischemic cellular alterations detectable by conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin light microscopy methods; 2) there is a hierarchy of cell types and anatomic sites that express 72-kd heat-shock protein, and this hierarchy reflects cellular and anatomic vulnerability to ischemic cell damage; and 3) 72-kd heat-shock protein induction in neurons bordering a necrotic ischemic core may be the morphological equivalent of the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
