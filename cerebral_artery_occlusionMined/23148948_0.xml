<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we used middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induced transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and found that WIN55, 212-2 augmented actively proliferating oligodendrocytes measured by CC1 immunoreactive cells within the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish whether these effects were associated with changes in myelin formation, we analyzed the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin ultrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that WIN55, 212-2 showed more extensive remyelination than vehicle at 14 days post injection (dpi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extracellular signal-regulated kinase/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway may be involved in OPCs differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the regulatory effect of WIN55, 212-2 post-treatment on phospho-ERK 1/2 (p-ERK 1/2) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, Western blot analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that WIN55, 212-2 regulated the phosphorylation level of the ERK 1/2 to promote OPCs survival and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, cannabinoid receptor 1 is coupled to the activation of the ERK cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following rimonabant combined treatment, the effect of WIN55, 212-2 on regulating the phosphorylation level of the ERK 1/2 was reversed, and the effect of accelerated myelin formation was partially inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, we first found that WIN55, 212-2 promoted OPCs differentiation and remyelination through regulation of the level of the p-ERK 1/2 via cannabinoid receptor 1 </plain></SENT>
