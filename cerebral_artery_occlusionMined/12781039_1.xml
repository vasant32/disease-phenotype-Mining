<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the clinical use of CT perfusion imaging (CTPI) and CT subtraction angiography (CTSA) for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with AICVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> within 24 hours were examined with regular CT, CTPI, and CTSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some cases received CTPI, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computer tomography (SPECT) during follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 24 cases, 11 had negative results from regular CT scans 3 - 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 6 cases, 6 - 12 hours in 3 cases, and 12 - 24 hours in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten of these cases were then confirmed by CTPI as having ischemic lesions, 2 with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and 1 case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) with CTPI negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 cases, 13 had positive results from regular CT, 9 were diagnosed with ischemic lesions larger by using CTPI than regular CT, 1 case had MCAO and 1 had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 cases with ischemic lesions observed with regular CT having nearly the same range as that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> using CTPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another 4 cases had more than 2 lesion areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The peak time (PT), mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and relative flow (RF) of 24 cases were markedly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sides of ischemic lesions compared to each other and the core of the lesion compared to peripheral zones were also altered significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined CTPI with CTSA can detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions at early and hyper-early stages and could distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and a larger area of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using semiquantitative blood perfusion analysis status, CTPI with CTSA could define position, area and range of the ischemic lesion and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These scans can also analyze the brain blood perfusion status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is important to early diagnose the occlusion of the entire division of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery and it is meaningful to assess prognosis and assignment of therapy </plain></SENT>
