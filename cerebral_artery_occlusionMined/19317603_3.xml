<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain additional insights into the pathogenic cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying different types of brain injury (e.g., trauma versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), recently attention has focused on the discovery and study of protein biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, using a high-throughput immunoblotting (HTPI) technique, we reported changes in 29 out of 998 proteins following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injuries to the rat brain (penetrating traumatic versus focal ischemic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we discovered that one protein, endothelial monocyte-activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> II precursor (p43/pro-EMAPII), was differentially expressed between these two types of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among other functions, p43/pro-EMAPII is a known pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the progression of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our current objective was to verify the changes in p43/pro-EMAPII expression, and to evaluate the potentially important implications that the differential regulation of this protein has on injury development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At multiple time points following either a penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI), or a transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) brain injury, tissue samples (6-72 h), CSF samples (24 h), and blood samples (24 h) were collected from rats for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in protein expression were assessed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that p43/pro-EMAPII was significantly increased in brain tissues, CSF, and plasma following PBBI, but decreased after MCAo injury compared to their respective sham control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This differential expression of p43/pro-EMAPII may be a useful injury-specific biomarker associated with the underlying pathologies of traumatic versus ischemic brain injury, and provide valuable information for directing injury-specific therapeutics </plain></SENT>
