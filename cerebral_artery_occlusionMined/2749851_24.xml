<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were allowed to survive for periods of up to 4 weeks after the operation, and we focused particular interest on the time course of blood flow changes from the initial ischemic events to the late stage of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional blood flow was measured using [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine and a quantitative autoradiographic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in regions with histologic signs of infarction (i.e., the lateral caudoputamen and adjacent neocortex) was below 0.238 ml/g/min, corresponding to 15% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for those regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In perifocal regions without infarction such as the medial caudoputamen and globus pallidus, cerebral blood flow was also reduced, but it never declined below 20% of its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease in cerebral blood flow was most marked during the first hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, cerebral blood flow values gradually normalized, and at 4 weeks there were no significant differences compared with the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The border between cortical regions with hypoperfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow was rather sharp in the coronal plane, but in the sagittal plane there was a more gradual transitional region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The region with hypoperfusion, observed in the sagittal plane, was most widespread in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and normalization of flow occurred particularly from anterior and posterior cortical regions toward the ischemic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility for penumbral conditions in the cortex thus exists, particularly in the anterior and posterior borders of the infarction, and remains for several hours after the initial insult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
