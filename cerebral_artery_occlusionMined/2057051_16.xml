<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made of TTC staining by immersion and perfusion techniques and conventional light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were quantified by measuring the ischaemic area at the sections corresponding to 7 mm in front of the AO line (atlas of Konig and Klippel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animals examined 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), the area of infarction was 17.4 +/- 1.3 mm2 on the TTC perfused slices and 17.6 +/- 1.6 mm2 on the TTC immersed slices (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, there was a marked difference between the two TTC methods when tissues were examined at shorter intervals after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the TTC-perfused animals, there was no significant difference between the mean areas of infarction measured at 5-20 min, 3-4 h, or 24 h post occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immersion in TTC, however, failed to reveal any consistent ischaemic damage when applied at the earlier post-occlusion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional histopathology demonstrated minimal lesions at 5-20 min but at 4 h or more the lesions were not significantly different from those demonstrated by TTC perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TTC immersion staining can, thus, only be used as a reliable marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> damage with post-occlusion survival periods of 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TTC perfusion staining gives results not significantly different from histopathology at 4 h or more post-occlusion but at earlier intervals than 24 h it differs significantly from TTC immersion staining.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
