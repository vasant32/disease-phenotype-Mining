<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pre-clinical development of therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> requires robust animal models; the rodent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) model using a nylon filament inserted into the internal carotid artery is the most popular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug screening requires targeted delivery of test substance in a controlled manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these needs, we developed a novel method for delivering substances directly into the ischemic brain during MCAo in the awake rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An indwelling catheter is placed in the common carotid artery ipsilateral to the occlusion at the time of the surgical placement of the occluding filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The internal and common carotid arteries are left patent to allow superfusion anterograde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgeries can be completed quickly to allow rapid recovery from anesthesia; tests substances can be infused at any given time for any given duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To simulate clinical scenarios, the occluding filament can be removed minutes or hours later (reperfusion) followed by therapeutic infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By delivering drug intra-arterially to the target tissue, "first pass" loss in the liver is reduced and drug effects are concentrated in the ischemic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To validate our method, rats were infused with Evans blue dye either intra-arterially or intravenously during a 4 hour MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a 30minute reperfusion period, the dye was extracted from each hemisphere and quantitated with a spectrophotometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significantly more dye was measured in the ischemic hemispheres that received the dye intra-arterially </plain></SENT>
