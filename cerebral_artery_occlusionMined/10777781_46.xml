<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is important for controlling the profile of gene expression and is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (MTase), an enzyme that is abundant in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because significant DNA damage and alterations in gene expression develop as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we measured MTase activity in vitro and DNA methylation in vivo after mild focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 30 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and reperfusion, MTase catalytic activity and the 190 kDa band on immunoblot did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl-group</z:chebi> incorporation into DNA increased significantly in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice after reperfusion, but not in mutant mice heterozygous for a DNA methyltransferase gene deletion (Dnmt(S/+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dnmt(S/+) mice were resistant to mild ischemic damage, suggesting that increased DNA methylation is associated with augmented brain injury after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this formulation, treatment with the MTase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> and the deacetylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> conferred <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protection in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, however, DNA methylation was not enhanced, and reduced dnmt gene expression was not protective in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model of excitotoxic/necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MTase activity contributes to poor tissue outcome after mild ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
