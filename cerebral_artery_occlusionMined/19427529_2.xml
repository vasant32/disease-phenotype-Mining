<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long term effects on cerebral blood flow following occlusion have received little attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined cerebral blood flow in both sides at multiple time points following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bilateral cerebral blood flow in young male Sprague Dawley rats was measured at the time of occlusion, as well as 4, 10 and 16 weeks after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under the present experimental conditions, the difference between the left and right side's cerebral blood flow was observed to appear to switch in direction in a visual oscillatory fashion over time in the sham-treated group, whereas the occluded animals consistently showed left side dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group of rats was intraparenchymally transplanted with a human neural stem cell line (CTX0E03 cells) known to have benefit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in the lesioned side of the cell-treated group was observed to be improved compared to the untreated rats and to demonstrate a similar oscillatory nature as that observed in sham-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that multiple bilateral monitoring of cerebral blood flow over time can show effects of stem cell transplantation efficiently as well as functional tests in an animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
