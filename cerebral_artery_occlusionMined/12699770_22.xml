<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The possible neuroprotective effect of physical exercise was investigated in rats after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that physical exercise in the form of a 12-week treadmill running programme reduced the volume of infarction caused by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the runner had increased gene expression for nerve growth factor (NGF) over the nonrunner with or without MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the NGF receptors, p75, was increased only in the absence of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, runners showed a significantly higher number of cholinergic neurons, which constitutively expressed p75, in the horizontal diagonal band of Broca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that neuroprotection after physical exercise may be a result of an increase in an endogenous neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor and the proliferation of its receptive cholinergic neurons </plain></SENT>
