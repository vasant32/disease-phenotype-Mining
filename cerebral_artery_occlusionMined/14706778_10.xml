<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with (n=40) or without (n=40) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were trained under each of three conditions: (1) motor balance and coordination training on Rota-rod; (2) simple exercise on treadmill; and (3) non-trained controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor function was evaluated by a series of tests (foot fault placing, parallel bar crossing, rope and ladder climbing) before and at 14 or 28 days after training procedures in both ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume in ischemic animals was determined with Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with both treadmill exercised and non-trained animals, Rota-rod-trained animals with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly (P&lt;0.01) improved motor performance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tasks except for foot fault placing after 14 days of training, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats having better performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals trained for up to 28 days on the treadmill did not show significantly improved function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to foot fault placing task, performance on foot placing was improved in ischemic rats across the three measurements at 0, 14 and 28 days regardless of training condition, while the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group reached their best performance at the beginning of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were found in rats trained either with Rota-rod (47+/-4%; mean+/-S.E.), treadmill (45+/-5%) or non-exercised control (45+/-3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, no obvious difference could be detected in the location of the damage which included the dorso-lateral portion of the neostriatum and the frontoparietal cortex, the main regions supplied by the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that complex motor training rather than simple exercise effectively improves functional outcome </plain></SENT>
