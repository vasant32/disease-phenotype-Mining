<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of JTP-4819 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg p.o for 7 days) significantly prolonged passive avoidance latency, while the latency of rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> receiving the vehicle was significantly shorter than that of sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prolonged escape latency in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was also significantly reduced by administration of JTP-4819 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg p.o.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, administration of JTP-4819 (0.3-3 mg/kg p.o. for 15 days) restored the decreased cortical thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-like immunoreactivity content of rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but did not affect the cortical and hippocampal substance P- or arginine vasopressin-like immunoreactivity content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that JTP-4819 ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> due to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by restoring the cortical TRH content </plain></SENT>
