<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into eight groups randomly: (1) sham-operated group, (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, (3-5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion (MCAO/R) 12 h, 48 h, and 7 days) and 0.9% saline groups, (6-8) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (MCAO/R 12 h, 48 h, and 7 days) and Ang-1 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was assessed by Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of ZO-1, occludin, and VE-cadherin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was significantly decreased after Ang-1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of ZO-1, occludin, and VE-cadherin were increased after Ang-1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were in accordance with the results of immunohistochemistry assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PKCα and phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC) expressions were decreased after Ang-1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that Ang-1 may decrease the permeability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> in MCAO/R rat by upregulation of ZO-1, occludin, and VE-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased expressions of PKCα and p-MLC induced by Ang-1 also involved in this process </plain></SENT>
