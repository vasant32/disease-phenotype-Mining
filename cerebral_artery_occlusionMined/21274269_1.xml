<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It plays an important role in the prevention of brain damage induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, many animal studies have suggested that the Panax ginseng (PG) has neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effects that come from a combination therapy of SO and PG in rat models with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals with MCAO were assigned randomly to one of the following four groups: (1) control (Con) group, (2) SO group (3 mg/kg, intravenously), (3) PG group (200 mg/kg, oral feeding), and (4) SO + PG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were subjected to a neurobehavior test including adhesive removal test and rotarod test at 1, 3, 7, 10, and 15 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral ischemic volume was quantified by Metamorph imaging software after 2-3-5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuronal cell survival and astrocytes expansion were assessed by immunohistofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the adhesive removal test, the rats of PG or SO + PG group showed significantly better performance than those of the control group (Con: 88.1 ± 24.8, PG: 43.6 ± 11, SO + PG: 11.8 ± 7, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, the combination therapy group (SO + PG) showed better performance than the SO group alone (SO: 56 ± 12, SO + PG: 11.8 ± 7, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In TTC staining for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, cerebral ischemic areas were also significantly reduced in the PG group and SO + PG group (Con: 219 ± 32, PG: 117 ± 8, SO + PG: 99 ± 11, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistofluorescence staining results showed that the group which received SO + PG group therapy had neuron cells in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also had a low number of astrocytes and apoptotic cells compared with the control or SO group in the peri-infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During astrocytes staining, compared to the SO + PG group, the PG group showed only minor differences in the number of NeuN-positive cells and quantitative analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these studies showed that in MCAO rat models, the combination therapy with SO and PG may provide better neuroprotective effects such as higher neuronal cell survival and inhibition of astrocytes expansion than monotherapy with SO alone </plain></SENT>
