<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (HO) results in brain ischemic tolerance (<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>), reducing ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have attempted to determine the time course of HO-induced upregulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rodents comprised five groups, breathing room air (RA; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>=21%), or 95% oxygen (<z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, HO) for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h (RA, 4HO, 8HO, 16HO, 24HO respectively) in the same chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each main group was subdivided to MCAO-operated (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>), and intact (without any surgery) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, MCAO-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS), mortality rate, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured in MCAO-operated subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>48 h after pretreatment, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes activities were assessed in MCAO-operated, sham-operated, and intact subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with 16HO and 24HO decreased NDS, mortality rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and increased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes activities (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase) significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance, the prolonged HO seems to partly exert their effects via increase in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes activities </plain></SENT>
