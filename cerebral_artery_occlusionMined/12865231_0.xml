<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five Wistar rats were divided equally into 5 groups, namely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, sham-operated control group, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> group (MACO group), eukaryotic expression plasmid group (pUCCAGGS group) and gene therapy group (receiving pUCCAGGS/hVEGF165).Rat models of permanent MACO was established by ligation with nylon suture, and in the latter two groups, pUCCAGGS or pUCCAGGS/ hVEGF165 was directly injected into the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the infarction, the rats were killed to obtain the brain tissues for immunohistochemical detection of HSP70 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the rat brain cortex of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham-operated control group, similar low levels of HSP70 expression were detected (P &gt;0.05), while in the MCAO group and pUCCAGGS group, HSP70 levels were both significantly higher (P &lt;0.01), showing no differences between the latter two groups (P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most intense HSP70 expression was detected in the gene therapy group (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the penumbra of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, MCAO, pUCCAGGS, and gene therapy group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had high expression levels of HSP70, which were comparable in the former two groups (P &gt;0.05), with the highest expression levels occurring in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, similar expression pattern was observed (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The elevated HSP70 expression in response to VEGF165 gene therapy in the rats as observed in this study suggests the potency of VEGF165 gene to induce HSP70 expression </plain></SENT>
