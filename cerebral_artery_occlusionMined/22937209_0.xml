<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a rat model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we profiled microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-protein coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many miRNAs were confirmed by qPCR to be robustly upregulated 24 hours following MCAO surgery including miR-155, miR-297a, miR-466f, miR-466h, and miR-1224 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we treated MCAO rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA), a mood stabilizer and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This post-insult treatment was shown to improve neurological deficits and motor performance following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To provide mechanistic insight into the potential targets and pathways that may underlie these benefits, we profiled miRNAs regulated following this VPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two promising post-insult VPA-regulated candidates were miR-331 and miR-885-3p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>miR-331 was also regulated by VPA pre-treatment in rat cortical neuronal cultures subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, an in vitro ischemic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predicted targets of these miRNAs analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>) identified networks involved in hematological system development, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These predicted networks were further filtered using <z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi> and showed significant associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, damage to cerebral cortex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data support common disease mechanisms that may be under miRNA control and provide exciting directions for further investigations aimed at elucidating the miRNA mechanisms and targets that may yield new therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
