<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic time window for treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury with XQ-1h is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> anesthesia, transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by 2h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), followed by 24h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Saline as vehicle or XQ-1h at the doses of 31.2, 15.6 and 7.8 mg/kg i.v. was administered at 0.5, 1, 2, 3h after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 24h after MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurological deficits and cerebral blood flow were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administrations of XQ-1h at the doses of 31.2mg/kg at 0.5, 1, and 2h after reperfusion of MCAO significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate (%) by 75.6% (5.2 ± 1.7), 66.2% (7.2 ± 1.9), and 47.9% (11.1 ± 1.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>XQ-1h (31.2mg/kg) treatment, 0.5, 1, and 2h after reperfusion produced significant improvement in neurological score compared to vehicle-treated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administrations of XQ-1h at the doses of 31.2mg/kg and 15.6 mg/kg at 0.5, 1, and 2h after reperfusion of MCAO significantly increased cerebral blood flow (mv) by 16.9 ± 1.9, 11.7 ± 1.3, 9.5 ± 1.0, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the therapeutic time window of XQ-1h for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion injury is within 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also discovered that the therapeutic time window of XQ-1h is deeply related with the activity of scavenging <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be conducted more drug combination therapy programs in order to assess the potential clinical application of XQ-1h </plain></SENT>
