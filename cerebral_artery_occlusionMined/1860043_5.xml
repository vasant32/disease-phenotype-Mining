<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was given 30 min before occlusion and each hour thereafter for 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological status of the rats was estimated 2, 24 and 48 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 48 h after occlusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">Cresyl violet</z:chebi>-stained sections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(R)-Phenylisopropyladenosine did not significantly reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, nor did it modify the neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As there is considerable evidence of the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> in normotensive rats, the present results may be due to a more abrupt reduction in cerebral blood flow in the territory surrounding the ischemic core, where neuroprotection could be expected, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, neuroprotection may be more difficult when focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
