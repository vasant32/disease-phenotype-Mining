<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further understand the role of granulocytes in microvascular occlusions, the responses of the granulocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules P-selectin and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 during middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion were examined in a primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve adolescent male baboons were used for 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 3) or for 3-hour occlusion with 1-hour (n = 3), 4-hour (n = 3), and 24-hour (n = 3) reperfusion, and three separate unoperated primates served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative immunohistochemical study of the microvascular distribution of P-selectin and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 was performed using 10-microns frozen sections from basal ganglia analyzed with computerized light microscopy video imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant (P &lt; .05) persistent upregulation of P-selectin (beginning during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and transient upregulation of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (at 1 and 4 hours of reperfusion) were observed on endothelium of selected post-capillary microvessels of the ischemic lenticulostriate artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet accumulation also occurred in this territory and was responsible for a significant proportion of the nonendothelial P-selectin signal at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion stimulates endothelial P-selectin and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 expression in brain microvessels in the ischemic zone, which may contribute to enhanced leukocyte adherence and persistent activation </plain></SENT>
