<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is extremely important to distinguish penumbra from ischemic core in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> studies, because the penumbra contains viable tissue, which can be salvaged by appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated (*)OH production in both core and penumbra regions of ischemic striatum during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis probes were placed in striatal tissue of rats subjected to the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The (*)OH-trapping agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30763">4-hydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (4-HBA) was administered by both i.v. and probe infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dialysate levels of the 4-HBA oxidation products, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36062">3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (3,4-DHBA), were determined by HPLC-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After microdialysis probe delivery of 4-HBA, (*)OH production was significantly increased in the striatal core during both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Penumbra (*)OH production increased only during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations of 3,4-DHBA concentration in dialysate following i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4-HBA administration were likely related to alterations in tissue blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings were confirmed by a greater oxidation of dihydroethidium in the ischemic core than in the penumbra as determined by fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings of (*)OH production in ischemic striatum are the opposite of those reported for ischemic cortex and suggest critical regional variations in (*)OH production that may have significant clinical implications in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
