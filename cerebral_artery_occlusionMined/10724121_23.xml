<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial pathological alterations within ischemic tissue using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine the extent and duration of functional impairment using objective behavioral tests after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI signatures derived from specific anatomical regions of interest (ROI) were then appropriately correlated to the behavioral measures over the time course of the study (up to 28 days post-tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12) were initially trained on the following behavioral tasks before surgery: bilateral sticky label test (for contralateral neglect); beam walking (for hindlimb coordination); staircase test (for skilled forelimb paw-reaching) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were then randomly assigned to receive either tMCAO (90 minutes, n = 6), by means of the intraluminal thread technique, or sham-control surgery (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proton density, T2- and T2-diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were acquired at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days post-tMCAO that were then smoothed into respective proton density, T2 relaxation, and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apparent percent total lesion volume was assessed using T2W imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signatures were evaluated using the tissue maps by defining ROI for MCAO and sham-control groups, which corresponded to the caudate-putamen, forelimb, hindlimb, and lower parietal cortices both ipsilateral and contralateral to the occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests were undertaken daily from 1 to 28 days post-tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrate that apparent percent lesion volume reduced from 1 to 7 days (P &lt; 0.05) but then remained constant up to 28 days for the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes in the temporal profile of T2 and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> tissue signatures were significantly altered in specific ROI across the time course of the study (P &lt; 0.05 to &lt;0.001), reflecting the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cavitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both T2 and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> measures of ischemic pathology correlated with parameters defined by each of the functional tests (r &gt; or =0.5, P &lt; 0.05) across the time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The staircase test revealed bilateral impairments for the MCAO group (P &lt;0.001), which were best predicted by damage to the ipsilateral lower parietal cortex by means of hierarchical multiple regression analyses (R2 changes &gt; or =0.21, P &lt; or =0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Behavioral recovery was apparent on the beam walking test at 14 to 28 days post-MCAO, which was mirrored by MRI signatures within the hindlimb cortex returning to sham-control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This long-term study is the first of its kind in tracing the dynamic pathologic and functional consequences of tMCAO in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both serial MRI and objective behavioral assessment provide highly suitable outcome measures that can be effectively used to evaluate promising new antiischemic agents targeted for the clinic </plain></SENT>
