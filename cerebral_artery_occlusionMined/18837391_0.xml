<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the synergistically therapeutic effects of BDNF gene-modified MSCs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We transfected MSCs with the BDNF gene using a lentivirus-based system and investigated whether the BDNF-modified MSCs contributed to improved functional recovery in a rat transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to untreated rats, rats that received both MSCs and BDNF-MSCs showed significantly more functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in modified neurological severity score(mNSS) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery was better in BDNF-MSCs than in MSCs (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the second week and second month after the systemic delivery of blank vector-modified MSCs and BDNF-modified MSCs, the treated rats exhibited more significant recovery than the control, including the accumulation and living of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-positive cells in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and surrounding areas, neuron-like changes, expression of surface markers of neural cells, and a large amount of BDNF expression in the BDNF-MSCs-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that BDNF-gene-modified rMSCs can migrate to surrounding areas of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> lesion, differentiate into neural cells, and survive for extended periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the synergy of BDNF, they may promote the recovery of the neurological function following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and represent a new strategy for stem cell-based therapy </plain></SENT>
