<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Collateral channels (CCs) are recruited to provide alternatives to CBF to ischemic regions once the primary vessel is occluded during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the knowledge of the relationship between dynamic evolution of collateral flow and the distribution of regional blood flow remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, laser speckle imaging was used to assess dynamic changes of CCs and regional blood flow in a rat cortex with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that CCs immediately provided blood flow to ischemic territories after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More importantly, there were three kinds of dynamic changes of CCs during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: persistent CC, impermanent CC, and transient CC, respectively, related to different distributions of regional blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was the possible occurrence of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarization (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi>) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there was no obvious significance about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time and duration of CCs between rats with and without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the initial arising of CCs does not ensure their persistence, and that collateral flow could be varied with distribution of regional blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which may facilitate the understanding of collateral recruitment and promote the development of collateral therapeutics in the future </plain></SENT>
