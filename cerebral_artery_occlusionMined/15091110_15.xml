<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that during pro-estrus (high endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels), brain damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) but not in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effect of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> on brain damage after MCAO in SHRSP and WKY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (0.025 mg or 0.25 mg, 21 day release) or matching placebo pellet was implanted into ovariectomized WKY and SHRSP (3 to 4 months old) who then underwent distal diathermy-induced MCAO 2 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> levels for placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> groups were as follows: WKY 0.025 mg 16.4 +/- 8.5 (pg/mL, mean +/- SD) and 25.85 +/- 12.6; WKY 0.25 mg 18.2 +/- 9.0 and 69.8 +/- 27.4; SHRSP 0.25 mg 20.7 +/- 8.8 and 81.0 +/- 16.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SHRSP, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at 24 hours after MCAO were similar in placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> groups: SHRSP 0.025 mg 126.7 +/- 15.3 mm (n = 6) and 114.0 +/- 14.1 mm (n = 8) (not significant); SHRSP 0.25 mg 113.5 +/- 22.3 mm (n = 8) and 129.7 +/- 26.2 mm (n = 7) (not significant), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In WKY, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 65% with 0.025 mg dose [36.1 +/- 20.7 mm (n = 8) and 59.7 +/- 19.3 mm (n = 8) (P = 0.033, unpaired t-test)] and by 96% with 0.25 mg dose [55.9 +/- 36.4 mm (n = 8) and 109.7 +/- 6.7 mm (n = 4) (P = 0.017)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage in normotensive rats with no significant effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite being contrary to our hypothesis, our findings add substance to the recently reported negative effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
