<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether delayed treatment with the anti-oxidant and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> ebselen reduces the volume of infarction in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ebselen (10 or 30 mg kg-1) or vehicle was administered by gavage 30 min and 12 h after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> by permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 24 h following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and the volumes of ischaemic damage in the ebselen and control groups were evaluated by quantitative histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ebselen was quickly absorbed following oral (gavage) administration and reached peak levels in the plasma by 1 h post-administration (plasma <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level of 0.68 +/- 0.04 and 0.84 +/- 0.1 microgram ml-1 for 10 and 30 mg kg-1, respectively, compared to control level of 0.51 +/- 0.02 microgram kg-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the lower dose of ebselen (10 mg kg-1) significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced the volume of infarction in the cerebral hemisphere and cerebral cortex (by 31.8% and 36.7%, respectively compared with the placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective efficacy of the higher dose ebselen (30 mg kg-1) was less than that of the lower dose ebselen (10 mg kg-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The volume of ischaemic damage in the cerebral hemisphere was reduced by 23.7% (P &lt; 0.02), and cerebral cortex by 27.5% (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both doses of ebselen (10, 30 mg kg-1) had no therapeutic efficacy on the caudate nucleus, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was most severe, in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Free radical-mediated injury is normally associated with reperfusion of ischaemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that oxidative injury is also a significant contributor to brain damage in models of maintained (permanent) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and that ebselen is effective in attenuating this free radical-induced damage </plain></SENT>
