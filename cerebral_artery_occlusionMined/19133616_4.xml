<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the migration of transplanted neural stem cells co-labeled with superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (SPIO) and bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) using the 4.7T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system and to study the cell differentiation with immuno-histochemical method in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat neural stem cells (NSCs) co-labelled with SPIO mediated by poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were transplanted into the unaffected side of rat brain with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after MCAO, migration of the labelled cells was monitored by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At week 6, the rats were killed and their brain tissue was cut according to the migration site of transplanted cells indicated by MRI and subjected to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining and immunohistochemical staining to observe the migration and differentiation of the transplanted NSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three weeks after transplantation, the linear hypointensity area derived from the migration of labelled NSCs was observed by MRI in the corpus callosum adjacent to the injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six weeks after the transplantation, the linear hypointensity area was moved toward the midline along the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI findings were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining and immunohistochemical staining of the specimen at week 6 after the transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flourescence co-labelled immunohistochemical methods demonstrated that the transplanted NSCs could differentiate into astrocytes and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI can monitor the migration of SPIO-labelled NSCs after transplantation in a dynamical and non-invasive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NSCs transplanted into ischemic rats can differentiate into astrocytes and neurons during the process of migration </plain></SENT>
