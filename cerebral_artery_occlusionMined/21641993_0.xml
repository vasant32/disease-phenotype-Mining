<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> are associated with AQP4 expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, changes in AQP levels and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were examined in the brains of male and female mice subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation were markedly less in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AQP4 expression in the ischemic cortex of females was relatively well preserved, whereas it was significantly decreased in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects disappeared in ovariectomized females but were reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AQP4 expression was decreased with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in females treated with ICI182,780, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> effect on the reduction of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> is associated with the preserved level of AQP4 that is partly mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
