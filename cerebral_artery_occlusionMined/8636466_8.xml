<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immunoreactivity of leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> increased in the ipsilateral central nucleus of the amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amygdalar neurochemical changes are likely the result of damage to the insular cortex, although other cortical areas were also affected by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether damage to the insular cortex is essential in eliciting these changes, a localized lesion of the right or left insular cortex was produced by microinjection of D,L-homocysteic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals received injections of vehicle into the right or left insular cortex or D,L-homocysteic acid into the right primary somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurochemical changes were examined immunohistochemically with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction 5 days after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of neuropeptide Y increased locally after excitotoxic damage to the insular cortex or primary somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amygdalar neurochemical changes, including neuropeptide Y increase in the basolateral nucleus and leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> increase in the central nucleus, were seen only when the ipsilateral insular cortex was lesioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These neurochemical changes were similar to those seen 5 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that damage to the insular cortex is essential in eliciting the neurochemical changes in the ipsilateral amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the change in neuropeptide Y in the cortex appears to be a local reaction occurring irrespective of location of the lesion and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor activation may be involved </plain></SENT>
