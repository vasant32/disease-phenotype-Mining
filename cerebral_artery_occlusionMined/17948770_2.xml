<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the protective effects of puerarine (Pur) against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is associated with depressing the extracellular levels of amino acid transmitters in brain of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 60 min followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pur (50, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> rate were detected on TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>)-stained coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extracellular levels of amino acid transmitters were monitored in striatum of rats with ischemic/reperfusion injury using in vivo microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the protective effects of Pur against <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi>-induced apoptotic and necrotic cells in hippocampus were estimated by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin-V and PI labeling cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pur (100 mg/kg) significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 31.6% (P&lt;0.05), reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume (P&lt;0.05), and improved neurological functions (P&lt;0.05) following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these rats, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced extracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (Asp), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Glu), y-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (Tau) were significantly reduced in striatum of vehicle-treated animals by 54.7%, 56.7%, 75.8%, and 68.1% (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pur reduced the peak values of Glu and Asp more obviously than those of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and Tau, and the rate of Glu/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> during MCAO markedly decreased in Pur-treated MCAO rats, compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> induced by Glu in cultured hippocampal neurons were significantly reduced after Pur treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> treatment with Pur at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion significantly depresses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced efflux of amino acids, especially, excitotoxicity in the striatum, a mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect on cellular survival </plain></SENT>
