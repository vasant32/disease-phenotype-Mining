<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The introduction of endoscopic harvest of saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) for coronary artery bypass procedures over the past few years has reduced the morbidity and enhanced patient satisfaction associated with this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report introduces the use of the endoscopic SVG harvest for extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic SVG harvest has been performed in more than 4000 patients at Duke University Medical Center from 1998 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed 4 such procedures for EC-IC bypass, including 3 for the treatment of large or giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and 1 for symptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2-cm transverse incision is made to harvest 25- to 30-cm segment of SVG using a VasoView graft harvest system (Guidant Cardiac and Vascular Surgery, Menlo Park, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skin closure was performed using a 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic SVG harvest was possible in each of the 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No graft leaks were visualized microscopically with infusion pressure testing of the graft before graft anastomosis, and no postoperative graft harvest complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, dehiscence, etc) were encountered in either the immediate or long-term follow-up (mean, 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of endoscopic SVG harvest presents an attractive alternative to open SVG harvest for EC-IC bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high-quality long graft may be harvested with apparent decreased morbidity via this minimally invasive technique </plain></SENT>
