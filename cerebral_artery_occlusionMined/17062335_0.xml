<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established in adult rats by placement of an intraluminal filament at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ligustrazine was administered intraperitoneally at a daily dose of 80 mg/kg starting at 2 h after MCAO, and BrdU (50 mg/kg daily) was also injected intraperitoneally starting at 4 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BrdU-positive cells in the SGZ were counted 7, 14 and 24 days after MCAO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham operation group, ischemic ipsilateral BrdU-positive cells in the ischemic model group increased 7 days after MCAO, reaching the peak on day 14, and decreased on day 21 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of ischemic ipsilateral BrdU-positive cells in ligustrazine group was significantly greater than that in the ischemic model group on days 7, 14 and 21 (P&lt;0.01), and maintained the high level on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine possesses long lasting effect of promoting cell proliferation in the SGZ after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
