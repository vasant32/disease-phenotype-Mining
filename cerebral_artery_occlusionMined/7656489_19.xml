<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected from four patients with severe head injury and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> for periods of 4.5-67 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were analysed in the dialysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratios of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were calculated to partially allow for changes in microdialytic conditions over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On-line pH was measured for up to 3 days in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiments with spontaneous hypertensive rats we found that extracellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> became unmeasurable in the ischemic zone after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in 3 patients <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> became undetectable for several hours, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> tended to decrease during measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by high ICP in one patient, and by a hypoxic episode in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the two other patients <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> ratios showed a rising trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> ratio show some correlations with clinical course and are promising parameters for cerebral monitoring and therapeutic decision making </plain></SENT>
