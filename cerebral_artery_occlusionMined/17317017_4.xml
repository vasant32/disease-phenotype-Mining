<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that a potential mechanism for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a result of modulating <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory has shown that in male rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> injection (systemic or direct intracortical injection) resulted in an immediate depolarization of cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced depolarization of cortical neurons was required in mediating the early events associated with this neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by co-injecting selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (MK-801) or AMPA (DNQX) glutamatergic receptors with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the MK-801-induced decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and MK-801 were co-injected directly into the cortex, no neuroprotection was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> or MK-801 was injected centrally 10 min prior to the injection of the other drug, significant neuroprotection was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This led us to hypothesize that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection required an initial activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggest that this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection was also associated with a significant increase in m-calpain and activation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) specific caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the results of current clamp experiments showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> significantly depolarized cortical neurons as well as enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> pretreatment may activate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors resulting in modification of ER-associated molecular mechanisms involved in neuroprotection following MCAO </plain></SENT>
