<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amount of various free fatty acids increased as polyphosphoinositides decreased during 3 and 6 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the occluded middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 3 hours of reperfusion following 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, free fatty acids partially recovered while polyphosphoinositides did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Water content increased significantly after 3 and 6 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and a further increase was found after 3 hours of reperfusion following 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The change of polyenoic fatty acids in this occluded middle cerebral artery territory was much smaller than that in the case of decapitation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, although the amounts of polyphosphoinositides and monoenoic and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> showed almost identical changes in both cases, probably because polyenoic fatty acids may be washed out and/or peroxidatively consumed in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model due to its residual blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the area surrounding the occluded middle cerebral artery territory were similar to the above results, although less dramatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no change in free fatty acids, polyphosphoinositides, and water content in the contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel free radical scavenger (MCI-186), which prevents both nonenzymatic peroxidation and lipoxygenase activity in vitro, markedly attenuated the ischemic and postischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that free radical mechanisms may be involved in ischemic and postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
