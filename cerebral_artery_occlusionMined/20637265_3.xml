<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether morroniside could protect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced brain injury by minimizing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morroniside was intragastrically administered to rats in doses of 30, 90 and 270mg/kg/day, starting 3h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behavioral test was performed by using the Zea-Longa scores, Prehensile Traction score and Ludmila Belayer score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume of brain was assessed in the brain slices stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortex tissues were also used for determination of malondialdehyde levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment with morroniside significantly improved Zea-Longa scores and Prehensile Traction score at the doses of 30, 90 and 270mg/kg, increased Ludmila Belayer score and reduced the infarction volume at the doses of 90 and 270mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morroniside (30, 90 and 270mg/kg) treatment significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde and caspase-3 activity by colorimetric analysis in ischemic cortex tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morroniside (270mg/kg) treatment significantly increased the content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, enhanced the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, but decreased the caspase-3 expression by Western-blot analysis in ischemic cortex tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrated that morroniside could notably protect the brain from damage induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> which might be related to morroniside <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-apoptotic properties in the brain </plain></SENT>
