<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which ARBs protect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> injury is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, an ARB, on the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) in response to focal brain I/R and to determine whether the neuroprotective phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normotensive Wistar rats were pretreated for 14 days with 5mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, then subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2h followed by reperfusion (MCAO-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurobehavioral outcomes in rats subjected to MCAO-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> pretreatment significantly suppressed an increase in inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and sustained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of eNOS expression 24h after MCAO-R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated eNOS and Akt levels were much lower than those in the sham group at 24h after MCAO-R, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> pretreatment significantly preserved eNOS phosphorylation in response to the activated Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, blockade of PI3K activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, totally abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>-induced eNOS phosphorylation, providing the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> stimulates eNOS phosphorylation through PI3K/Akt signaling in the MCAO-R rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide a mechanistic basis underlying the benefits of using selective ARBs, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
