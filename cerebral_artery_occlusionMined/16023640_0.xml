<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of external carotid artery (ECA) transection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether isolated interruption of an arterial or a venous connection to the ECA territory was sufficient to induce masticatory hypoperfusion and lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated a direct access to the common carotid artery (CCA) with subsequent vascular closure with regard to its feasibility, frequency of masticatory lesions, complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral and masticatory lesions and perfusion deficits were assessed by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel patency was evaluated using computerized tomography angiography and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interruption of arterial blood flow led to masticatory hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Masticatory lesions occurred in 6% of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Access to and closure of the CCA were feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, leading to moderate or severe vessel stenosis in 20%, and intraarterial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 25% of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reproducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 24% of the rats, hyperintense MRI signal changes were observed in the ipsilateral temporal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the induction of masticatory hypoperfusion and lesions by arterial transection supports the role of the ECA in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Direct access to the CCA with subsequent vessel closure led to stenosis in most animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Preservation of ECA continuity was not suitable to fully prevent masticatory lesions </plain></SENT>
