<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, DETA-NONOate, increases endogenous ischemic brain SDF1 and BMSC CXCR4 and MMP9 expression, which promotes BMSC migration into ischemic brain and thereby enhances functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), and 24 hours later, the following were intravenously administered (n = 9 mice per group): (a) phosphate-buffered saline; (b) BMSCs (5 x 10(5)); (c) 0.4 mg/kg DETA-NONOate; (d) combination of CXCR4-inhibition BMSCs with DETA-NONOate; and (e) combination of BMSCs with DETA-NONOate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms underlying combination-enhanced BMSC migration, transwell cocultures of BMSC with mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) or astrocytes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment significantly improved functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with BMSC monotherapy and MCAo control, and it increased SDF1 expression in the ischemic brain compared with DETA-NONOate monotherapy and MCAo control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of BMSCs in the ischemic brain was significantly increased after combination BMSC with DETA-NONOate treatment compared with monotherapy with BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of engrafted BMSCs was significantly correlated with functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DETA-NONOate significantly increased BMSC CXCR4 and MMP9 expression and promoted BMSC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration to MBECs and astrocytes compared with nontreatment BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of CXCR4 or MMPs in BMSCs significantly decreased DETA-NONOate-induced BMSC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that DETA-NONOate enhanced the therapeutic potency of BMSCs, possibly via upregulation of SDF1/CXCR4 and MMP pathways, and increased BMSC engraftment into the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
