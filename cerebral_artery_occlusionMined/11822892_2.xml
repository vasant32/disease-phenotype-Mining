<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that angiopoietin system genes in SHRSP may follow unique patterns of expression after experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHRSP, hypertensive control rats (SHR), and normotensive controls (WKY) were subjected to experimental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and brain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was analyzed for expression of angiogenic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of angiopoietin-2 increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rat strains and was significantly enhanced in SHRSP compared with control strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of angiopoietin-1 and the angiopoietin receptor dropped markedly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in SHRSP animals, but was not different after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in SHR and WKY strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SHRSP brain elaborates a unique and specific pattern of angiopoietin system gene expression after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> susceptibility of these rats </plain></SENT>
