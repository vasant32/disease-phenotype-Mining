<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the mechanisms of further evolution that occurs from the early to late phase after initial changes in diffusion-weighted imaging after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, proton density-, T1- and T2-weighted imaging were performed on days 0, 2, and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination (IgG, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining) was done after scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) in the ischemic hemisphere were significantly decreased on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> increased over time and became significantly higher than the contralateral side by day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in basal ganglia occurred more rapidly than in cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proton density-, T1-, and T2-weighted scans showed maximal changes on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From day 0 to day 2, there are significant correlations between changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and changes in T1-weighted signals and T2-weighted signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic exam showed early neuronal injury on day 0, intense gliotic activity and protein leakage associated with infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on day 2, and cavitation in severely infarcted areas on day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After initial reduction of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, the subsequent increase in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values on day 2 may be associated with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Later elevations in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> may be related to cavitation of infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
