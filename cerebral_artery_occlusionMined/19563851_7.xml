<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that the fenamate, mefenamic acid, is neuroprotective in an in vitro and in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embryonic rat hippocampal neurons were cultured and maintained for up to 14 days in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 9 or 14 days, cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (5microM) or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (5microM) plus mefenamic acid (10-100microM) or the control agent, MK-801 (10microM) for 10min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>24h later, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined by measuring <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, male Wistar rats (300-350g) were subjected to 2h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals received either a single i.v. dose of MFA (10mg/kg or 30mg/kg), or MK-801 (2mg/kg) or saline prior to MCAO or, four equal doses of MFA (20mg/kg) at 1h intervals beginning 1h prior to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic damage was then assessed 24h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro, mefenamic acid (10-100microM) and MK-801 (10microM) significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-evoked cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with control cultures </plain></SENT>
