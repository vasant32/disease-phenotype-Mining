<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Ann Neurol 17 (1985) 497) for use in mice by refining the application route of the dye, illumination and stereotactic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After intraperitoneal injection of the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose bengal</z:chebi>, subsequent focal illumination of the brain with a cold light source through the intact skull led to focal cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of reproducible size, location and geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">Cresyl violet</z:chebi> histology displayed well-demarcated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that matured with time in a predictable manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microglial responses, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, against F4/80 and CD11b antigens were rapid and complete at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site, but delayed and incomplete in degenerating fiber tracts and ipsilateral thalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the rat, where the expression of CD4 and CD8 antigens discriminate distinct subpopulations of lesion-associated phagocytes, the expression of both markers was low to absent in the mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both rats and mice, cerebral photothrombosis shares essential <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may provide a useful model to study functional aspects of lesion-associated and remote molecular responses in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
