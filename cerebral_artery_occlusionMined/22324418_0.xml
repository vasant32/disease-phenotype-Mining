<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> molecule that has been shown to be associated with the proliferative capacity of endogenous neural precursor cells during embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown to regulate the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ), which are also upregulated in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of exogenous administration of intrathecal Shh protein were examined in the setting of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, with particular attention given to endogenous neural stem cell proliferation and migration as well as inducible differences in behavioral recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was created using the intraluminal suture method of reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with intrathecal administration of Shh protein at 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing was performed, and the animals were killed for measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was performed and measurements of cellular proliferation were obtained, with a focus on the proportion and distribution of neural progenitor cells in the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These values were compared across experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with intrathecal Shh protein resulted in significant improvement in behavioral function compared with the control group, with a significant reduction of ischemic tissue in the cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase of nestin immunoreactive cells was observed along the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal Shh <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> at doses that upregulate spinal cord GLI1 transcription increases the population of neural precursor cells after spinal cord injury in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration of Shh protein appears to have a neuroprotective effect in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and is associated with improved behavioral recovery, which may be related to its effects on neurogenesis in the SVZ and could be associated with improved functional recovery </plain></SENT>
