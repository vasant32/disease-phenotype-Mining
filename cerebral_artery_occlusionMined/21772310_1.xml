<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested if coexpression of angiopoietin-1 (ANG1) with VEGF improves blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity and VEGF neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects using a permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult CD-1 mice were injected with 2 × 10(9) virus genomes of adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors expressing VEGF (AAV-VEGF) or ANG1 (AAV-ANG1) individually or together in a 1:1 ratio into the ischemic penumbra 1 hour after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AAV-LacZ was used as vector control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with AAV-LacZ, coinjection of AAV-VEGF and AAV-ANG1 reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> volume (46%, P=0.004); injection of AAV-VEGF or AAV-ANG1 individually reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> volume slightly (36%, P=0.08 and 33%, P=0.09, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of VEGF reduced tight junction protein expression and increased Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with VEGF expression alone, coexpression of ANG1 with VEGF resulted in upregulation of tight junction protein expression and reduction of Evans blue leakage (AAV-ANG1/AAV-VEGF: 1.4 ± 0.3 versus AAV-VEGF: 2.8 ± 0.7, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coinjection of AAV-VEGF and AAV-ANG1 induced a similar degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> as injection of AAV-VEGF alone (P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, coexpression of ANG1 with VEGF improved <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity and resulted in better neuroprotection compared with VEGF expression alone </plain></SENT>
