<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of nimodipine, a calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-K+/MG+2 ATPase activity, Ca+2/Mg+2 ATPase, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and early ultrastructural findings were examined at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced by permanent unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group I, the rats which had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and not received medication were used for determining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-K+/Mg+2 ATPase, Ca+2/Mg+2 ATPase, the extent of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation by measuring the malondialdehyde content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrastructural findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group II, the rats which had only subtemporal craniectomy without occlusion and received saline solution were used for determining the effect of the surgical procedure on the biochemical indices and ultrastructural findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group III, the rats received saline solution following the occlusion in the same amount of nimodipine and in the same duration as used in Group IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group IV, nimodipine pre-treatment 15 min before occlusion (microgram kg-1 min-1 over a 10 min period) was applied i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-K+/Mg+2 ATPase and Ca+2/Mg+2 ATPase activities decreased significantly and promptly as early as 10 min and remained at a lower level than the contralateral hemisphere in the same group and at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level in Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine pre-treatment immediately attenuated the inactivation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-K+/Mg+2 ATPase (p &lt; 0.05) but there was no change on Ca+2/Mg+2 ATPase activity (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine pre-treatment decreased the malondialdehyde level in Group IV (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study supports the possibility that nimodipine pre-treatment effects the membrane stabilizing properties via inhibiting the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and subsequently restoring some membrane bound and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> dependent enzymes' activity such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-K+/Mg+2 ATPase and the ultrastructural findings </plain></SENT>
