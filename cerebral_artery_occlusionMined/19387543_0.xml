<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 2 h followed by 1 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caspase-12 immunohistochemistry was first increased in the penumbra 1 h after reperfusion, with a peak at day 1 to day 3, and then gradually decreased to basal level at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL-positive cells and ultrastructural observation of brain sections in the penumbra showed a similar change at the same time points </plain></SENT>
