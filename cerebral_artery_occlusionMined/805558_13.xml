<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears to be a useful drug in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extradural mass-forming lesions, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, respiratory <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>, and spinal cord injuries, in rhesus and squirrel monkeys, dogs, and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data from these studies suggest that in the experimental models used, DMSO is clearly superior to no treatment, and appears to be more generally effective than other comparable treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No satisfactory answer has yet been found to explain the beneficial effects of DMSO, but several hypothetical suggestions are offered; their validation hinges primarily on further confirmatory evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further experiments with our present models and alternative research lines are discussed </plain></SENT>
