<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning on blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in subsequent ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly divided into four groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham-operated, MCAO and EA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In EA group, rats received electroacupuncture stimuli at the Baihui acupoint (GV 20) 30 minutes/day for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after last treatment, the MCAO was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain water content and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability were measured 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 expression and activity were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the brain water content of ischemic hemisphere was lower in EA group (81.45 +/- 1.09%) compared with MCAO group (83.98 +/- 1.30%; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the Evans blue content in EA group (4.90 +/- 1.77 microg/g) was lower compared with MCAO group (9.41 +/- 2.87 microg/g; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protein expression and enzyme activity of MMP-9 increased and reached maximum at 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the protein expression was lower in EA group at 12 and 24 hours after reperfusion (p&lt;0.01, versus MCAO group), and enzyme activity was lower in EA group only at 24 hours (p&lt;0.01, versus MCAO group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: EA preconditioning could attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption caused by subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EA preconditioning could decrease MMP-9 expression and activity, which may be an important mechanism of cerebral ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
