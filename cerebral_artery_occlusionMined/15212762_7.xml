<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that NALP1 gene expression was induced in primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) upon injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of NALP1 was also observed in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the biological consequence of over-expression of NALP1 in both HeLa cells and in CGN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of recombinant NALP1 stimulated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in both HeLa cells and CGN by an apoptotic mechanism, demonstrated by the induction of apoptotic nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and activation of the apoptotic enzyme caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also described here are studies on the mechanism of action studies including deletion analyses and investigations of nucleotide binding, which begin to elucidate a regulatory function for NALP1 in neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
