<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We quantitatively evaluated the highly sensitive acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and local <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization 7 days after left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats with occlusion, the ipsilateral frontal cortex and the nucleus basalis Meynert developed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, whereas the subcortical striatum did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the frontal cortex on the occlusion side, the acetylcholinesterase-positive fiber density was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced; a computer-assisted image-analyzing system quantified approximately 1.0 m/mm3 brain cortex acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers in the ipsilateral frontal cortex layers II-IV and approximately 9.7 m/mm3 brain cortex acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers in the contralateral frontal cortex layers II-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was also significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased in the ipsilateral frontal cortex compared to the contralateral side and sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that functional disturbances and disruption of the cholinergic pathway between the frontal cortex and the nucleus basalis Meynert occur after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
