<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether PTHrP can be induced in brain in response to ischemic injury and whether PTHrP can act locally as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> in the cerebral vasculature, an effect that could be neuroprotective in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTHrP expression was examined by Northern analysis and immunohistochemical staining in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatory effects of superfused PTHrP(1-34) on pial arterioles were determined by intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of PTHrP(1-34) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> administration on MCAO infarction size reduction were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PTHrP expression was induced in the ischemic hemisphere as early as 4 h after MCAO and remained elevated for up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased immunoreactive PTHrP at sites of ischemic tissue injury was located in the cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Superfusion with PTHrP(1-34) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for up to 25 min increased pial arteriolar diameter by 30% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In animals with permanent MCAO, PTHrP(1-34) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (-47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, PTHrP expression increases at sites of ischemic brain injury in the cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This local increase in PTHrP could be an adaptive response that enhances blood flow to the ischemic brain, thus limiting cell injury </plain></SENT>
