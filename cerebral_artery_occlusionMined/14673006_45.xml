<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous work demonstrated that replacement with physiological concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protects the cortex against middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex exhibits caspase-dependent programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) in many models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> attenuates PCD during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study explored the temporospatial pattern of markers of PCD, their relationship to the evolution of injury, and their modulation by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were ovariectomized and treated with either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One week later, rats underwent MCAO, and brains were collected at 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed the temporospatial evolution of infarction volume, DNA fragmentation, and levels of spectrin cleavage products in ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> led to a delay and attenuation of injury-mediated DNA fragmentation as early as 8 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> also dramatically reduced the level of the 120 kDa caspase-mediated spectrin breakdown product (SBDP120) at 4 hr but not at 8 or 16 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SBDP150, produced by caspase and calpain, showed peak levels at 16 hr but was not altered by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> protects the ischemic cortex by attenuating PCD, thereby reducing caspase activity, DNA fragmentation, and subsequently, overall cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
