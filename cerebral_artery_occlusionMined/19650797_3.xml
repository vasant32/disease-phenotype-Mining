<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asialoerythropoietin (aEPO), a derivative of cytokine erythropoietin, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects without haematological complications when administered in single or repeated doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines our hypothesis that aEPO may provide neuroprotection against programmed apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when administered in a continuous low dose </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was introduced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery using a surgically placed intraluminal filament in young male Sprague Dawley rats (9 weeks old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 90 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, reperfusion was established by filament removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both study and control groups had implanted osmotic minipumps through which they received either aEPO (1 microL/h; 20 microg/kg per 24 h) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (1 microL/h) for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Day 4, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, the number of apoptotic cells and concentrations of activated caspase 3 and 9 were evaluated in the penumbra region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asialoerythropoietin was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of the study group, whereas none was detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there were no significant changes in haematocrit levels or behaviour scores (on Days 1 and 4) between the study and control groups, aEPO administration significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the study group compared with the control group (168 +/- 19 vs 249 +/- 28 mm(3), respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> nick end-labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells and the concentration of activated caspase 3 and 9 in the penumbra region were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that aEPO provides a short-term, possibly histological, protection in young adult male rats when administered immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
