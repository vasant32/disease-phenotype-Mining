<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recovery from the debilitating effects of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is variable and unpredictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To maximize patient recovery, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the repair processes affecting neuronal protection, particularly in the penumbra region, is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown, in human subjects, the increased expression of several growth factors soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, together with appearance of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, in particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK1/2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we demonstrate a relatively short-lasting (&lt; 12 h), but substantial increase in expression of phosphorylated proteins, in particular, p-JNK (phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p-ERK1/2 in both the grey matter penumbra and infarcted tissue of rats, following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p-ERK1/2 was associated with neurones and endothelial cells in the vicinity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> while p-JNK was mainly expressed in neurones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of both p-MEK3/6 and p-p38 MAP kinase was also increased in neurones and astroglia, within 1 h of infarction, p-p38 remaining elevated and associated with neurones and in particular with astroglia in the penumbra region for &gt; 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that short-term activation of these proteins may be detrimental to neuronal survival, while their transient nature makes them unlikely to support <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, revascularization and reperfusion over a period of days and weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, short-medium-term up-regulation of neuronal p-JNK, p-c-Jun, p-Stat-1 and p-p38 might be a factor in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic manipulation of phosphorylation/activation of these and other important signalling intermediates might form the basis of an appropriate treatment to maximize revascularization and neuronal protection after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
