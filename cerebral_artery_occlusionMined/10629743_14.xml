<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on increased neuronal levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> reductase (BVR) in response to ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BVR is an oxidoreductase, and is unique among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enzymes characterized to date in having dual pH/dual cofactor requirements--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> at 6.7 and 8.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BVR catalyses the final step in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> metabolic pathway and reduces the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> degradation product, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi>, to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> can be both a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50910">neurotoxicant</z:chebi> and an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> depending on its ratio to protein and concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> also has immunomodulatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other biologically active <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> degradation products are iron and CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study assessed time-dependent changes in the level of BVR, following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also examined correlation of the change in BVR expression with display of indices of ischemic tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia and normothermic conditions, 72 DNX inbred mice were subjected to MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A time-dependent enlargement of an ischemic lesion over the course of 24 h was observed and measured 55 +/- 5 mm3 at 6 h, 63 +/- 6.7 mm3 at 12 h, and 73 +/- 5 mm3 at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six hours after MCAo, increased immunoreactivity for BVR was noted in neurons in the peri-ischemic areas, intraischemic cortical layers 3 and 5, as well as in neurons in regions distant from the borders of vascular distribution of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, such as those in substantia nigra, in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and in the central nucleus of inferior colliculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAo, immunoreactivity for BVR remained increased in the peri-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points staining for BVR was decreased in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the 24 h time point there was an increase in Fe staining in the perimeter of the lesion and an increase in Schiff's staining for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation at the rim of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated a time dependent increase in BVR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> labeling in neurons of the peri-ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic hemisphere, when compared with the contralateral hemisphere, neither measurable decreases in BVR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or total protein levels nor a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-dependent BVR activity at pH 6.7 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As judged by Northern and Western blots and activity analysis, despite the apparent loss of BVR from the ischemic core, and its increase in the peri-ischemic region, when compared with the contralateral hemisphere, the overall capacity of the ischemic hemisphere to catalyze the reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> was unchanged throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Should, in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the conditions favor the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, then we suggest that increase in BVR expression in ischemic penumbra may present a cellular defense mechanism against free radical-mediated neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we interpret the apparent tightly regulated expression of BVR in the ischemic hemisphere as an important factor in protection against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Data suggest that pharmacological modulation of BVR expression is a possible new direction for protecting neurons against ischemic injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
