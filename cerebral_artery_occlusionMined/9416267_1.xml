<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF was measured by the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of red blood cells (RBC) and plasma in cerebral microvessels was determined by radioluminography using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-RBC and 125I-bovine serum albumin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean transit times of RBC and plasma, blood volume, and hematocrit were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The water content was measured by specific gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood flow was reduced to 2% of the control value in the central core, where the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was the most severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood volume decreased to 25% and the mean transit times of RBC and plasma increased about tenfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the outer periphery, where CBF was reduced to 39% but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was not induced, the blood volume was decreased to 76% while the mean transit time of RBC was increased 2.1-fold, being greater than the increase in the plasma transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has variable effects on the blood volume and flow velocities of RBC and plasma in the parenchymal microvessels depending on the depth of blood flow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease in blood flow is probably related to a reduction in the flow velocities of RBC and plasma in the surrounding ischemic tissue rather than to decreased number of perfused capillaries in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
