<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate underlying mechanisms in-vivo, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development was followed by ultra-high field MRI at 17.6 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was induced by transient-middle-cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery-occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) for 1 hour in C57/BL6 control mice (N = 10) and mice treated with 100 µg Fab-fragments of the GPIb blocking antibody p0p/B 1 h after tMCAO (N = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To control for the effect of reperfusion, additional mice underwent permanent occlusion and received anti-GPIb treatment (N = 6; pMCAO) or remained without treatment (N = 3; pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI 2 h and 24 h after MCAO measured cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) by continuous arterial-spin labelling, the apparent-diffusion-coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), quantitative-T2 and T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were registered to a standard mouse brain MRI atlas and statistically analysed voxel-wise, and by cortico-subcortical ROI analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-GPIb treatment led to a relative increase of postischemic CBF vs. controls in the cortical territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (2 h: 44.2±6.9 ml/100 g/min versus 24 h: 60.5±8.4; p = 0.0012, F((1,18)) = 14.63) after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subcortical CBF 2 h after tMCAO was higher in anti-GPIb treated animals (45.3±5.9 vs. controls: 33.6±4.3; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both regions, CBF findings were clearly related to a lower probability of infarction (Cortex/Subcortex of treated group: 35%/65% vs. controls: 95%/100%) and improved quantitative-T2 and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After pMCAO, anti-GPIb treated mice developed similar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> preceded by severe irreversible hypoperfusion as controls after tMCAO indicating dependency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protection on reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Blockade of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> by anti-GPIb-Fab-fragments results in substantially improved CBF early during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding was in exact spatial correspondence with the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and indicates in-vivo an increased patency of the microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, progression of infarction during early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion can be mitigated by anti-platelet treatment </plain></SENT>
