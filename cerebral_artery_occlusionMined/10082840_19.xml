<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> response element binding protein (CREB) is one of the most important mechanisms controlling various gene transcriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the phosphorylation of CREB was examined immunohistochemically at 24 h of recirculation following 1.5 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO was induced by the intraluminal suture method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core revealed a significant reduction in the number of immunoreactive cells with the anti-phosphorylated CREB and with the anti-CREB antibody, which binds to both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CREB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area exhibited a marked increase in the number of immunopositive cells as well as in the intensity of nuclear staining with each antibody, so that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cells expressing CREB demonstrated phosphorylation of CREB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, about half of the CREB immunopositive cells reacted weakly with the anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody in the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that the expression as well as phosphorylation of CREB protein was significantly activated in the regions surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since phosphorylation of CREB has recently been implicated in signal transductions that promote the survival and differentiation of neurons, the present data suggest that tissue repair mechanisms may be markedly activated in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
