<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present study investigated early recanalization rate of major occluded arteries after tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) infusion using serial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with t-PA within 3 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four serial MRA studies were conducted: before, immediately, 24 h and 5-7 days after t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial MRA demonstrated occluded brain arteries in 64 patients: M1 occlusion, 30 patients; M2, 12, and internal carotid artery (ICA), 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combining M1 and M2 occlusion, the recanalization rates (complete and partial) were 52.3% (19.0 and 33.3%) within 1 h, 80.9% (47.6 and 33.3%) at 24 h and 87.8% (73.2 and 14.6%) 7 days after t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the recanalization rate of ICA occlusion was 31.8% (4.5 and 27.3%) within 1 h, 51.1% (14.3 and 47.6%) at 24 h and 66.7% (38.9 and 27.8%) 7 days after t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization rate at 24 h and 7 days was lower in ICA occlusion than M1 and M2 occlusion (p = 0.014 and p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Within 1 h after t-PA infusion, approximately half the patients with major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> had early recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICA occlusion is resistant to intravenous t-PA therapy compared with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
