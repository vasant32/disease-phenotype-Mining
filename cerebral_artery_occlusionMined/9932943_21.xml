<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of an antileukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> antibody (anti-CD18) as an adjuvant for delayed (2 hours and 4 hours) thrombolytic therapy (recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator [rt-PA]) in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA is limited in its application by a short therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO by a single fibrin-rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were assigned to the following experimental groups: Experiment 1 (treatment 2 hours after embolization), 1) rt-PA, 2) anti-CD18 antibody, 3) rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody, 4) immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and 5) vehicle; Experiment 2 (treatment 4 hours after occlusion), 1) rt-PA alone, 2) rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody, and 3) nontreated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits, infarction volume, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and brain myeloperoxidase (MPO) immunoreactivity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Administration of rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody 2 hours later reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.05) the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurologic deficits compared with the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rt-PA alone improved neurologic deficits significantly and reduced mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with anti-CD18 antibody neither reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume nor improved neurologic deficits compared with the IgG-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody treatment at 4 hours reduced significantly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and MPO immunoreactive cells compared with rt-PA treatment alone at 4 hours, and reduced neurologic deficits compared with rt-PA treatment alone and compared with the nontreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of antileukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> antibody and thrombolytic therapy may increase the therapeutic window for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
