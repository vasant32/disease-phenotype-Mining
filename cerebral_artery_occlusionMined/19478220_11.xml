<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To elucidate how the motor pathways rewire the denervated tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated remodeling of the corticospinal tract (CST) in transgenic mice with yellow fluorescent protein CST labeling in conjunction with transsynaptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudorabies</z:e> virus retrograde tracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male CST-yellow fluorescent protein mice were subjected to permanent right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n=8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Foot-fault test was performed to monitor functional deficit and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudorabies</z:e> virus tracer was injected into the left forelimb muscles at 1 or 4 weeks after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (4 days before euthanasia), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third group of CST-yellow fluorescent protein mice without middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The yellow fluorescent protein labeling of CST in the cervical cord and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudorabies</z:e> virus labeling of pyramidal neurons in the bilateral cortices were measured on vibratome sections using a confocal imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, axonal density in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-affected side of the cervical cord was significantly decreased at 11 days (P&lt;0.001) and significantly increased at 32 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with the Day 11 values (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudorabies</z:e> virus labeling was significantly decreased in the ischemic hemisphere 11 days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a significant increase was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033839" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudorabies</z:e> virus labeling of bilateral cortices 32 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with 11 days (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CST axonal density in the denervated spinal cord and pyramidal neuron labeling in the bilateral cortices were significantly correlated with behavioral recovery (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may, at least in part, be attributed to neuronal remodeling in the corticospinal system </plain></SENT>
