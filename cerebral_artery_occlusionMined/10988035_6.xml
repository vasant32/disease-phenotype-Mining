<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The possible persistence of a microvascular deficit at long time intervals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induction is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rats, we have generated in vivo maps of the regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) at different time intervals after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) with the aim to evaluate the persistence of a rCBV deficit in the damaged area or in the surrounding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at different time intervals, starting from the first day until three months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and postmortem histological and ultrastructural correlation was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MRI experiments were carried out using an imager-spectrometer equipped with a 4.7 Tesla magnet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To produce the susceptibility-weighted rCBV images, a suspension of superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>-25) was injected to the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a control group (nonoperated or sham-operated rats), a symmetrical distribution of rCBV values was found between the two hemispheres (differences between left and right cortex below 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rats with MCAo an evident vascular asymmetry was found 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (differences between left and right ranging from 22 and 77%) and reduced rCBV values were evident in the ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a time range following the 15th day most of the rats showed a complete recovery of the lesion while only four animals still had a small residual lesion, as probed by T2-weighted (T2W) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three of these four cases, the reduction of rCBV in the ipsilateral cortex with respect to the contralateral was greater than 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation was found (Y &gt; 0.8) between late rCBV measurement and the initial volume of the lesion (hyperintense region in T2W images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postmortem measurements correlate much better with the rCBV data than with the T2W ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that cortical lesions may result in a deficit of rCBV for long periods and that a mismatch between T2w and rCBV data can be present during the repair process </plain></SENT>
