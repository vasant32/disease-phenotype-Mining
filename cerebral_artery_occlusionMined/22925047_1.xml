<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression profiling in the brains of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) was comparatively analyzed by gene chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed gene RFK was further verified by q-PCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protective role of RFK-regulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30527">flavins</z:chebi> (including <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24041">flavin mononucleotide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24040">flavin adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30527">flavins</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD)-treated neurons was examined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 76 differentially expressed genes, 41 genes were upregulated, and 35 genes were downregulated in SHRSP as compared with SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RFK was significantly downregulated in SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30527">Flavins</z:chebi> markedly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in MCAO mice, inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in OGD-treated neurons, and decreased Bax protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physiological downregulation of RFK may be a new potential risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which probably affects the absorbance and utility of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> and further destroys the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30527">flavins</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RFK might act as a therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
