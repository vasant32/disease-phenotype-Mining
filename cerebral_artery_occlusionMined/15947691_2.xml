<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms in bladder overactivity induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CI was induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in female Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bladder activity was monitored with continuous infusion cystometrography of conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were obtained from the pontine tegmental area (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) 1, 3, 5, 12 and 24 hours after CI or sham operation (SO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg intravenously), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>) glutamatergic receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on bladder activity, and on COX-1 and 2 mRNA expression following MCAO were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the effects of CI on gene expression in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 (0.01 to 10 mg/kg intravenously) on bladder activity were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bladder capacity of CI rats was significantly decreased 1 to 24 hours after MCAO compared with that of SO rats (p &lt;0.05 or 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One and 3 hours after MCAO mean COX-2 mRNA expression +/- SE had increased significantly to 22.4 +/- 3.5 in terms of its expression relative to the outer control in a sample obtained immediately after MCAO, in contrast to that in SO rats (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression level returned to the control level within 12 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COX-1 expression was not influenced by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK-801 inhibited the development of bladder overactivity and significantly decreased the expression of COX-2 mRNA in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NS398 before MCAO prevented the development of bladder overactivity in a dose dependent manner and did not influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the development of bladder overactivity following MCAO is accompanied by an increase in COX-2 mRNA expression in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>COX-2 in the brain may be a new target for the treatment of neurogenic voiding dysfunction after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
