<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of hyperthermic pretreatment on infarcted volume after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), as well as the contribution of A1 receptors, to the responses in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized animal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: An animal research laboratory in a medical university </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> during each pretreatment, as well as for MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were assigned as follows: (i) sham-control group (n = 8), which was maintained at normothermia (37 +/- 0.2 degrees C pericranial temperature) for 15 mins, then kept in an awake state for 0.5, 3, 6, 18, 24, or 48 hrs before 2-hr MCAO; (ii) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> group (n = 8), which was subjected to 42 +/- 0.5 degrees C for 15 mins, and then received the same treatment as the sham group; (iii) DPCPX (a selective central <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>)-treated control group, which was given the agent before normothermia pretreatment, then kept for a recovery time of 0.5 or 24 hrs (n = 8 in each group) before MCAO; (iv) DPCPX plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>-treated group, which was administered the agent at the same dose as the control before hyperthermic exposure, then selected for each recovery time (n = 8 in each group) before MCAO; (v) DPCPX-ischemic group, to which the agent was administered before MCAO (n = 8); and (vi) vehicle-ischemic group, in which peanut oil as a vehicle, instead of DPCPX, was injected before MCAO (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Values are expressed as mean +/- se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done by analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's F test, Mann-Whitney U test, or the chi-square test as appropriate (p &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The infarcted volume in hyperthermic animals kept for 18 or 24 hrs before the occlusion procedure was significantly smaller than in the sham controls, but not in rats kept for 0.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 48 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPCPX partially reversed the reduction in infarcted volume that was induced by hyperthermic preconditioning after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas the agent itself did not affect the volume after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that hyperthermic pretreatment reduces the effects on MCAO-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, possibly via a partial mediation of the central <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptors in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest a need for further studies to define the relationship between heat shock proteins and central <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptors in preconditioning </plain></SENT>
