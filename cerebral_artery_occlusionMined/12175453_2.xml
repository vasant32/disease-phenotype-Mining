<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg ip) was administered twice-once at the time of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and again at the time of reperfusion-and evaluated for its protective effect by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (30 min after reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the DWI experiments, one group of animals was euthanized 2 h after reperfusion for the estimation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, while in another group, neurological deficit was assessed 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-treated group, percent hemispheric lesion area (%HLA) in DWI was significantly attenuated (11.7+/-5.2) as compared to vehicle-treated group (21.4+/-4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) (301.8+/-22 nmol/g wet tissue) in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-treated group was significantly decreased as compared to that in the vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats (420+/-20 nmol/g wet tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An insignificant change was observed in the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> in both the vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was significantly improved in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-treated group (1.8+/-0.06) as compared to the vehicle-treated (2.9+/-0.38) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> using DWI in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded rats </plain></SENT>
