<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the possible protective effect of TASK-1 (TWIK-related acid-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel-1, kcnk3) and -3 potassium channels during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TASK-1 and TASK-3, members of the two pore domain (K2P or kcnk) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel family, form hetero or homodimers and help set the resting membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used male TASK-1 and TASK-3 knockout mice in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured 48 h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TASK-1 knockout brains had larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (P=0.004), and those in TASK-3 knockouts were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the TASK-1 gene is expressed in adrenal gland, heart and possibly blood vessels, the higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in the TASK-1 knockout mice could be due to TASK-1 regulating blood vessel tone and hence blood pressure or influencing blood vessel microarchitecture and blood flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that male TASK-1 knockout mice had <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp>, likely explaining the increased brain injury seen after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus to make precise conclusions about how TASK-1 protects neurons, neural- or organ-specific deletions of the gene will be needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a consequence of having TASK-1 channels expressed (in various non-neuronal tissues and organs) is that neuronal damage is lessened when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurs </plain></SENT>
