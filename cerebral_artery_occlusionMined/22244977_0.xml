<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Delayed activation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can lead to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), resulting in hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we focused on tight junction proteins (TJPs), occludin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> occludens (ZO)-1, and claudin-5, which are important structural components of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, and investigated whether inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) provides a protective effect against hemorrhagic complications induced by tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We subjected mice to 6-h filamental middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with vehicle, delayed tPA alone, or combined tPA (10 mg/kg, i.v.) plus GM6001 (100 mg/kg, i.p.), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and the expression of MMP-9 and TJPs by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM6001 significantly reduced tPA-elevated brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, MMP-9, and inhibited the degradation of occludin and ZO-1 induced by tPA, but not claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GM6001 also significantly prevented the decrease in the survival rate and the reduction in locomotor activity caused by tPA at 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GM6001 treatment also significantly prevented cell damage, determined by release of lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and the decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) induced by tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that GM6001 prevented the hemorrhagic complications and improved the behavioral abnormalities induced by tPA, partly via protection of TJPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that GM6001 may be a useful candidate for combination therapy against the hemorrhagic complications induced by tPA </plain></SENT>
