<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of delayed treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a pan HDAC inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA), on white matter injury and neurogenesis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of VPA at a dose of 100mg/kg for 7 days starting 24h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats significantly improved neurological outcome measured 7-28 days post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the VPA treatment significantly increased oligodendrocyte survival and newly generated oligodendrocytes, which was associated with elevation of myelinated axonal density in the ischemic boundary 28 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VPA treatment also increased the expression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter 1 (GLT1) in the ischemic boundary after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and increased acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 expression in neuroblasts and the number of new neurons in striatal ischemic boundary region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study provides new evidence that the delayed VPA treatment enhances white matter repair and neurogenesis in ischemic brain, which may contribute to improved functional outcome </plain></SENT>
