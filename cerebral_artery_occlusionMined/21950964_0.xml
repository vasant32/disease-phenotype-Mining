<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the role of autophagy in thalamic β-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> after cerebral cortical infarction in hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 7 and 14days after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and β-amyloid deposits were evident in the ipsilateral ventroposterior nucleus, and the activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1, required for β-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> generation, was elevated in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In correlation, both the number of cells showing punctate microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 3 fluorescence and levels of light chain 3-II protein, an autophagosome marker, were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, most of the cells that over-expressed β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 displayed punctate light chain 3 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> significantly reduced the thalamic neuronal damage, β-amyloid deposits, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that autophagosomes accumulate within thalamic cells after cerebral cortical infarction, which is associated with thalamic β-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> via elevation of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 level </plain></SENT>
