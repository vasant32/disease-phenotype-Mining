<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study 40 adult rats were submitted to periods of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of 30, 60 and 90 min without reperfusion and animals submitted to a sham procedure were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the levels of ATP, malondialdehyde and caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the biochemical measurements were observed between the right and left brain hemispheres of the same animal in each experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced ATP levels were observed after the three periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared to the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in malondialdehyde or caspase-3 levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite significant changes in ATP levels, the results indicated cell viability in the ischemic region as shown by the low rates of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, findings probably related to the lack of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
