<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate whether the therapeutic effects of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> could be monitored by serial ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO)-enhanced MRI in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice received a three-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> treatment (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 12) after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>USPIOs were administered 5 h post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed before, 24 h and 48 h post-USPIO administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI endpoints were the extent of signal abnormalities on R2 maps (=1/T2) and quantitative R2 changes over time (∆R2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem brains were prepared either for immunohistology (n = 16) or for iron dosage (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, blood-brain barrier permeability and F4/80 immunostaining for microglia/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas of R2 maps &gt; 35 ms(-1) also appeared significantly decreased in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>-treated mice (ANOVA for repeated measures, P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a fair correlation between these areas and the amount of iron in the brain (R(2) = 0.69, P = 0.010), but no significant difference in ∆R2 was found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the extent of signal abnormalities on R2 maps can be used as a surrogate marker to detect <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> effects in a murine experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
