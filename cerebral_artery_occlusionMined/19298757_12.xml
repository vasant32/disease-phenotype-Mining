<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats were examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) non-treatment and MCAO with G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced with the suture occlusion method for 90 minutes, and treatment was given at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed 24 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment included neurological scores, infarction volumes, histology, immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: G-CSF significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ameliorated the early neurological outcome scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that G-CSF treatment significantly elevated the cIAP2 levels and decreased the activation of caspase 3 in the ischemic cortex compared with the non-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent works also showed that G-CSF treatment inhibited both neuronal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">glial tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interleukin 1beta expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The neuronal anti-apoptotic action of G-CSF may be mediated in part by the anti-apoptotic protein cIAP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-CSF also exerts anti-inflammatory actions after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by preventing both neuronal and glial pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions </plain></SENT>
