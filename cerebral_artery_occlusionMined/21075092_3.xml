<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) system is currently recognized as the major cellular defense mechanism under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, but the involvement of the Keap1-Nrf2 system in the ischemic brain injuries has not been fully investigated to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated temporal changes of Keap1, Nrf2, and their downstream antioxidative proteins in post-ischemic mice brains with respect to spacial differences between the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions and the regions destined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, a steady level of Keap1 showed a decremental expression started at 2h of reperfusion after 60 min of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Nrf2 began to show a significant increase at 2h with a peak at 8h of reperfusion after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both Keap1 and Nrf2 are mainly expressed in neuronal cells but not in glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, downstream antioxidative proteins such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 showed significant increases at later time-points of 24-72 h of reperfusion after tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the regions destined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, a similar trend of expression changes to those in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions was observed in Keap1, Nrf2, and 3 downstream antioxidative proteins with much less reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes found in this study suggest that the induced antioxidative stress proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may play an important endogenous neuroprotective response under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
