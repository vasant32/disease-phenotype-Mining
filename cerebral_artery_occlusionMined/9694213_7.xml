<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a modified method of focal ischemic preconditioning (FIP) followed by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), we studied the effects of ischemic tolerance on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FIP was achieved by obstructing the blood flow into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using miniature clamps at two points simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first point was proximal to its origin and the second was where it intersects the middle cerebral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats subjected to three short conditioning periods (3 x 3 min with 7 min reperfusion between occlusions), there were significant reductions in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the cerebral cortex induced by the subsequent MCAO in FIP-treated rats compared with sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This rapid FIP-induced ischemic tolerance to subsequent MCAO occurred within 1 day and lasted for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in the cortex was significantly reduced for up to 2 days after FIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation increased rapidly after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in this increase was observed in FIP-treated rats, suggesting a correlation with the subsequent reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
