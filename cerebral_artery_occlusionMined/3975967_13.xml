<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural history of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion has become increasingly important since the surgical option of EC/IC bypass surgery has been available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of 24 patients with angiographically-demonstrated occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> artery was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients presented with a major disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and five of these died during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of this ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 19 patients were followed for a mean of 54.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in follow-up and two of these were due to subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients manifested a benign course: one of these had a further minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period (2 fatal, 1 minor) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were in the territory of the artery known to be occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those patients who survived their presenting ischemic event, 12 (63%) remained completely functional in terms of activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion does not necessarily carry a poor prognosis with medial therapy alone and the role of bypass surgery hopefully will be clarified by the ongoing clinically randomized trial </plain></SENT>
