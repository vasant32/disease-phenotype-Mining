<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> repair of implanting central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) stem cells together with mesenchyme, because <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> stem cells can be expected to adapt and survive in the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was induced by the Koizumi-Longa method, using the adult male spontaneous hypertensive rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was performed an hour after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rat mesencephalic neural plate at the early somite stage (embryonic day 10.5) together with the adjacent ventral mesenchymal tissues was dissected out under the microscope and immediately implanted into the ischemic rat striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One month later, the cognitive function was evaluated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic and immunohistochemical examinations of the graft were made with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (H&amp;E), neurofilament-200, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the water maze study, mean latency times required to reach an escape platform in the implanted animals with surviving grafts were found to be shorter than in those without grafts, but longer than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the spatial probe trial, the number of animals seen to cross the area in the pool where the platform had been located was greater in the implanted rats with surviving grafts than in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple vascularization in the grafted area was observed histologically in H&amp;E-stained tissues, and neurofilament-200-positive cells were recognized in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TH staining revealed within the graft many immunoreactive neuron-like cell bodies with long dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that grafted <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> stem cells with mesenchyme may survive and differentiate into mature <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue within the adult ischemic rat brain, constructing vessels in and around the grafts, and may therefore have the potential to be effective in the recovery of the cognitive function of the rat model </plain></SENT>
