<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rasagiline, as the mesylate salt (TVP-1012), is a selective, potent, non-reversible MAO-B inhibitor of the propargylamine type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current cellular and whole animal studies suggested a potential for neuroprotection by rasagiline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rasagiline in repeat ip doses of 1-3mg/kg within 16h, or by sustained iv infusion to maintain a 3-h steady-state at corresponding levels, improved the outcome of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five independent studies using different protocols, rasagiline improved neurological severity score (NSS) with respect to saline from a high of 8.96 +/- 2.18 (n = 94) at 24h, and 7.64 +/- 2.52 (n +/- 49) at 48h, to a low of 7.13 +/- 2.32 (n = 88) at 24h, and 4.99 +/- 2.31 (n = 68) at 48h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under the same conditions, there was a decrease in the volume of necrotic brain region determined at 48h by triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC), from a high of 240 +/- 66 (n = 54) to a low of 176 +/- 77 mm(3) (n = 55); and by MRI scan at 48h, from a high of 297 +/- 62 (n = 25), to a low of 209 +/- 63 mm(3) (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement in NSS was more obvious at 48h post MCAO, at the higher dose, when timing of drug administration was within the interval -30 min to 3 h from MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 3-h iv infusion of rasagiline caused a maximal reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of about 49% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The (S)enantiomer of rasagiline TVP-1022, not a MAO inhibitor, was less effective, but still significantly different from saline, NSS at 48h 5.6 +/- 2.5 (n = 24) vs. 7.5 +/- 2.5 (n = 24), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 200 +/- 64 (n = 24) vs. 240 +/- 55 mm(3) (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9086">Selegiline</z:chebi> (n = 19) at corresponding ip doses was not different from saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dizocilpine decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 277 +/- 65 (n = 20) to 203 +/- 52mm(3) (n = 21) but could not improve NSS at 24 or 48h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this model, rasagiline could have exerted a neuroprotective effect independent of MAO inhibition </plain></SENT>
