<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study to determine whether the inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) gene containing the sequence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-responsive enhancer (HRE) was an HIF-1 target after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and iNOS western blot analysis were performed in the ischemic core, in the area surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and in the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, both HIF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were examined in the ischemic core, in the area surrounding the ischemic core and in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that pMCAO up-regulates iNOS protein in the ischemic core, in the area surrounding the ischemic core and in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the lesion, and that the activation of iNOS expression is mediated by HIF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HIF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels increased in the ischemic core and in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the lesion compared with the levels obtained in the corresponding areas of sham-operated controls or in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Particularly in the area surrounding the ischemic core, HIF-1alpha protein accumulated during pMCAO although <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the activation of HIF-1 might be involved in the mechanisms whereby iNOS promotes cell survival and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
