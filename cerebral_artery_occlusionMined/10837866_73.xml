<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have validated the use of TaqMan RT-PCR for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> localisation studies in human and rat tissues, and for the investigation of gene expression changes in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human brain, D(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was enriched in caudate nucleus and putamen, whilst in rat brain, highest levels of D(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were observed in striatum and nucleus accumbens, consistent with the known distribution of this receptor in basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), endogenous interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated over 30-fold at 24 h post-lesion in both striatum and cortex ipsilateral to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was transiently upregulated 3.7-fold at 3 h, but not at 24 h or 3 days after induction of cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our observations in these two animal models using TaqMan RT-PCR were consistent with previous reports using other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TaqMan RT-PCR assays provide a rapid and reliable method for semi-quantitative analysis of gene expression in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
