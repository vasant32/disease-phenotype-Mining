<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared these staining techniques using the mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL6 mice were subjected to a 90 min transient MCAO and sacrificed at 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham operated mice served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two millimeters coronal brain slices were cut at +1.3, -0.7, -2.7 and -4.7 mm from bregma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sections were stained with 2% TTC for 20 min and the caudal face of each slice was scanned with a flatbed scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sections were kept in 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> solution for 4 weeks (the solution was changed every week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The slices were cryosectioned (40 microm thick), mounted on slides and stained with CV and scanned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and area were measured by the image-J program for both the staining techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area or volume between the TTC and CV stained sections (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TTC and CV staining showed a high degree of correlation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and volume indicating that both methods are suitable for producing accurate measurements of cerebral experimental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
