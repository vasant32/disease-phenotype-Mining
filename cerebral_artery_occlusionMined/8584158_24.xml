<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a single, compact, fiberoptic sensor has become available for measuring oxygen, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, pH and temperature in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have adapted this instrument for continuous use in brain tissue to measure oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension (pCO2), pH, and temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this new technique, we produced <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increase</z:e>, and hypoxemia in seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an additional six animals, sensors were placed within a zone of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced by occluding the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensor readings were compared with cerebral blood flow measurements, intracranial pressure, and brain histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An in vitro experiment was also performed using human blood to test the accuracy of the sensor over a wide range of pCO2 and oxygen tension values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After careful precalibration and rigid cranium fixation, stable measurements could be obtained throughout the 6- to 8-hour experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, brain oxygen was 42 +/- 9 mm Hg, brain <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> was 59 +/- 14 mm Hg, brain pH was 7.0 +/- 0.2, and brain temperature was 36.7 +/- 0.7 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>Hypocapnia</z:mp> and hypoxemia produced a significant decline in tissue oxygen (&lt; or = 30 +/- 3 mm Hg; P &lt; 0.001), whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increase</z:e> produced a significant increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi>(&gt; or = 74 +/- 4 mm Hg; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced a rapid 42% decline in brain oxygen (25 +/- 7 mm Hg) and a 25% increase in tissue pCO2 (71 +/- 23 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain oxygen further decreased to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg toward the end of the experiment, 4 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the regional cerebral blood flow decreased to 10 +/- 5 ml per 100 g per minute, within the 1st hour, from a baseline value of 65 +/- 15 ml per 100 g per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It then gradually increased to 15 +/- 5 ml per 100 g per minute by the end of the 4-hour experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Brain pH was closely and inversely related to brain <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The brain temperature in the focally ischemic tissue decreased from 36.7 +/- 0.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6 degrees C by the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The in vitro experiment demonstrated good linear correlation between the sensor readings and the blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Continuous monitoring of oxygen, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, pH, and temperature in damaged or at-risk brain tissue using a single sensor is now feasible and will, thus, allow improved continuous monitoring of neurosurgical patients who are at risk of significant secondary brain damage </plain></SENT>
