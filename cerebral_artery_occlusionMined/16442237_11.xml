<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> is released after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and produces cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been described that after ischemic preconditioning, the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown that an in vitro model of ischemic preconditioning produces upregulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters which mediates brain tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now decided to investigate whether ischemic preconditioning-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter upregulation takes also place in vivo, its cellular localization and the mechanisms by which this upregulation is controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A period of 10 min of temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was used as a model of ischemic preconditioning in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EAAT1, EAAT2 and EAAT3 <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters were found in brain from control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning produced an up-regulation of EAAT2 and EAAT3 but not of EAAT1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic preconditioning-induced increase in EAAT3 expression was reduced by the TNF-alpha converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> BB1101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral administration of either anti-TNF-alpha antibody or of a TNFR1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide also inhibited ischemic preconditioning-induced EAAT3 up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies suggest that, whereas the expression of EAAT3 is located in both neuronal cytoplasm and plasma membrane, ischemic preconditioning-induced up-regulation of EAAT3 is mainly localized at the plasma membrane level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, these results demonstrate that in vivo ischemic preconditioning increases the expression of EAAT2 and EAAT3 <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters the upregulation of the latter being at least partly mediated by TNF-alpha converting enzyme/TNF-alpha/TNFR1 pathway </plain></SENT>
