<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the efficacy and limitations of the intra-arterial local infusion of a high-dose fibrinolytic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we analyzed the results of 44 patients and compared them with those of 51 patients treated with intracarotid (18 patients) or intravenous (33 patients) infusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten megaunits of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or 24 x 10(4) IU of urokinase were administered through a microcatheter placed into or proximal to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> for 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When arterial recanalization was not achieved, a second or third infusion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of complete and partial recanalization just after the local infusion were 52 and 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were high in middle cerebral and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and low in internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (69, 78, and 20%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our use, there was no difference between tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase in restoring blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to recanalization in patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showing marked improvement was 4.8 hours, and it was 5.8 hours with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of infarction was reduced, and the outcome was good in patients with complete recanalization achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction within 24 hours was 22%, and only one patient clinically deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the intracarotid infusion group (20 x 10(4) IU of urokinase for 30 min), only two patients showed partial recanalization without clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction was 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcome in this group and the intravenous infusion group (18 x 10(4) IU of urokinase a day for 1 wk) was poor compared with that in the local infusion group showing complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study appears to suggest that intra-arterial local fibrinolytic therapy could be a new strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
