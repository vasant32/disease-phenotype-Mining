<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the impact of the location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (internal carotid artery, proximal M1 segment, distal M1 segment, M2 segment, and M3 segment of the middle cerebral artery) in predicting the clinical outcome of patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy (&lt;3 h) in a retrospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was detected with computed tomography angiography in 105 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical and radiological information was collected and entered into logistic regression analysis to predict favorable clinical outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale from 0 to 2 was a primary outcome measure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there was a significant increase in mortality (32% vs. 3%, P &lt; 0.001) and functional dependency (82% vs. 29%, P &lt; 0.001) in patients with internal carotid artery or proximal M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> compared to a more distal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the regression analysis, after adjusting for National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-treatment time, the clot location was an independent predictor of good clinical outcome (P = 0.001) and exhibited dose-response type behavior when moving from a proximal vessel position to a more distal one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the location was dichotomized, a cutoff between the proximal and the distal M1 segments best differentiated between good and poor clinical outcome (OR = 16.0, 95% CI 3.9-66.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid artery or proximal M1 segment of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is generally poor even if treated with intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternative revascularization strategies should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular imaging at the admission is required to guide this decision </plain></SENT>
