<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Gingko biloba extract (GBE) on the changes of connexin 43 (Cx43) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of rat cortex and hippocampus induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion and astrocyte gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-reoxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 24 hours of reperfusion, there was obvious neurological deficit in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of rat cortex and hippocampus in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> hemisphere were decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When GBE at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight was administrated by p.o. daily for 7 days, the neurological deficit was improved, and lower Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion were recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The i.p. injection of nimodipine (0.7 mg/kg weight body) also showed improvement on neurological deficit and Cx43 expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte GJIC was measured by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>-reoxygenation induced a significant decrease in GJIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with GBE (100 mg/l) and nimodipine (1.6 mg/l) significantly prevented the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-reoxygenation inhibition of GJIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that GBE could exert its neuroprotective effects by improvement of Cx43 expression and GJIC induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reoxygenation/ reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
