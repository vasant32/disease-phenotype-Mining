<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of an endothelin-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>, CGS 26303, on neurological deficit, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid arteries (triple vessel occlusion) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the pretreatment study, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 90-minute triple vessel occlusion, and CGS 26303 was administered intravenously 30 minutes before triple vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The compound was subsequently administered at 6, 12 and 18 hours post-triple vessel occlusion, and neurological status was evaluated 1, 12 and 24 hours after triple vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at 24 hours post-triple vessel occlusion, brains were perfusion-fixed, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were reduced when compared with vehicle-treated animals by 48%, 50%, and 57% in rats receiving CGS 26303 at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, while the neurological score was significantly improved in the highest-dose CGS 26303-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another study, CGS 26303 treatment was initiated 1 hour after triple vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were reduced by an average of 42-50% in the CGS 26303 treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores of animals treated with CGS 26303 at 10 mg/kg were decreased by 59% and 45% upon evaluation at 12 and 24 hours post-triple vessel occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that CGS 26303 may have potential for the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
