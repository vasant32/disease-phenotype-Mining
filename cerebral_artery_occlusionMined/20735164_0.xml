<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These factors were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-l), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups: a vehicle group, BMSC group, EPC group and BMSC combined with EPC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) then implanted intravenously with 3 × 10(6) BMSC, EPC, BMSC/EPC or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic functional deficits were measured on days 1, 7, 14, 28 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 7 after transplantation, quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of VEGF, SDF-1, bFGF, IGF-l, TGF-β, PDGF-BB, BDNF, GDNF and NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurologic evaluation found that the neurologic severity scores were no different between the four groups on day 1, and the scores of rats in the BMSC/EPC group were significantly lower than those of rats in the other groups on days 7, 14 and 28 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of bFGF, VEGF and BNDF were significantly higher in the BMSC/EPC group compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intravenous transplantation of BMSC combined with EPC could promote the functional rehabilitation of rats with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the mechanism may be related to the enhanced expression of factors </plain></SENT>
