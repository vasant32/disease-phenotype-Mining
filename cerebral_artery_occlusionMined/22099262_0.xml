<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK protein and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> combined therapy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male SD rats were subjected to 120min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with intraluminal thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into 4 groups: 1) 37°C vehicle administration (37V); 2) 37°C <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK administration (37F); 3) 35°C vehicle administration (35V); and 4) 35°C <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK administration (35F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK protein was intravenously administered 60min after the induction of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> (35°C) was applied during 120min MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 24h later; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured, and Bax, Bcl-2, TUNEL and caspase-12 immunostaining was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction in 37F, 35V, and 35F groups compared to 37V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant difference between 37F and 35F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> enhanced the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found in neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caspase-12 and TUNEL staining showed a significant difference between 37F and 35F; however, Bax and Bcl-2 staining failed to show a difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study we showed an additive protective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>-FNK treatment, and immunohistological results showed that the protective mechanisms might involve the inhibition of apoptotic pathways through caspase-12, but not through Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
