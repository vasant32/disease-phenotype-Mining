<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in the hematopoietic system has been well studied; however, its role in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) response to injury is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated increased immunoreactivity for SHP-1 in a subset of reactive astrocytes that do not appear to enter the cell cycle following deafferentation of the chicken auditory brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether mammalian astrocytes also upregulate SHP-1 immunoreactivity following <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> injury, a mouse model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was utilized to study SHP-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains of 3-week-old mice were analyzed at four time points following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO): 1, 3, 7, and 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes within surgical groups, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes decrease as a function of time from 1 day (maximum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume) to 14 days (minimum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume) post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, SHP-1 protein levels are upregulated following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and this increase peaks at 7 days post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of confocal images further reveals that immunoreactivity for SHP-1 occurs predominantly in GFAP+ reactive astrocytes, although a small percentage of F4-80+ microglia are also double labeled for SHP-1 at early times post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These SHP-1+ reactive astrocytes do not appear to enter the cell cycle (as defined by PCNA immunoreactivity), confirming our previous studies in the avian auditory brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SHP-1 plays an important role in the regulation of glial activation and proliferation in the ischemic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
