<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While a number of studies have investigated transmitter outflow in anesthetized animals after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) performed by craniectomy, studies have never been performed after MCAO induced by intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been reported that after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume correlates with functional outcome and with transmitter outflow, although there are no studies that demonstrate a direct correlation between transmitter outflow and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess excitatory amino acids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> outflow in awake rats after intraluminal MCAO and to determine whether, in the same animal, outflow was correlated with neurological outcome and histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vertical microdialysis probes were placed in the striatum of male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours, permanent MCAO was induced by the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transmitter concentrations in the dialysate were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAO, neurological deficit and histological outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> transmitters significantly increased after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the rats showed a severe sensorimotor deficit and massive ischemic damage in the striatum and in the cortex (9+/-2% and 25+/-6% of hemispheric volume, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found between the efflux of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transmitters, neurological score, and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, for the first time, amino acid and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> extracellular concentrations during MCAO by the intraluminal suture technique were determined in awake and freely moving rats, and a significant correlation was found between transmitter outflow and neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of neurological deficit, histological damage, and transmitter outflow in the same animal may represent a useful approach for studying neuroprotective properties of new drugs/agents against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
