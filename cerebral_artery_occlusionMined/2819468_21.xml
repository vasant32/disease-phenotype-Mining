<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the rat is an excellent model for focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats are readily available, inexpensive and their neuroanatomy and brain function have been studied extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increases in plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and myocardial damage have been observed in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined autonomic and myocardial changes in two rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one model only the middle cerebral artery was occluded (MCAO) while the other model involved occlusion of both the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the common carotid artery (MCAO/CCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously in 25 male rats (326-430 g) that underwent one of the following procedures: (1) MCAO only; (2) MCAO/CCAO; (3) CCAO only; and (4) sham occlusions (SHAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood samples (0.5 ml) for radioenzymatic assay of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (E) were taken twice before the occlusions and at 90 and 180 min after the occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The animals were perfused at the end of the experiment and the heart removed and examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tetrazolium salts were reacted with oxidative enzymes to delineate the region of inadequate perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean blood pressure and pulse pressure of the SHAM, MCAO/CCAO and CCAO groups significantly declined from initial values (from an average of 78 to 53 mm Hg) during the course of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the mean blood pressure and pulse pressure of the MCAO rats did not change during the experiment, so that the final mean blood pressure and pulse pressure were significantly higher than in the other 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The levels of both NE and E increased significantly (NE, 1443 +/- 285.9 to 4095 +/- 929 pg/ml; E, 2402 +/- 623 to 3741 +/- 1166 pg/ml) following occlusion in the MCAO group only while the other 3 groups did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of 6 hearts in the MCAO group were abnormal, showing evidence of subendocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, ischemic damage or subendocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MCAO also resulted in a consistent region of the brain with inadequate perfusion including the insular cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These autonomic and myocardial changes appear to mimic some of the changes seen clinically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and provide the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model for studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
