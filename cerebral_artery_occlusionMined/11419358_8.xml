<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rat model of reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was developed to assess the role of neutrophils and prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) on cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the ipsilateral caudate putamen nucleus was reduced by approximately 50% during 2 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, but unaffected on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil accumulation in brain was documented as myeloperoxidase concentration, which was elevated in both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres at 1 and 46 h after occlusion/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HBO2 administered before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at 2.8 atm abs for 45 min, as well as antibody-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, reduced neutrophil accumulation, functional neurologic deficits, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that one mechanism for benefit of HBO2 is related to its ability to ameliorate post-ischemic injury by inhibiting neutrophil sequestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mechanism should be taken into consideration when choosing partial pressures of oxygen for investigational clinical protocols </plain></SENT>
