<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because of their beneficial effects in patients with hemorrhagic shock and multiple-system trauma, hypertonic saline solutions are increasingly being used perioperatively for volume resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> effects of hypertonic saline on brain are well documented in a variety of brain injury paradigms, its effects on the water content on other organs has not been studied rigorously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a) hypertonic saline when given as an intravenous bolus and continuous infusion attenuates water content of small bowel, lung, and brain in rats without neuro-injury; and b) attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated increases in lung water is dependent on achieving a target serum osmolality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In rats without neuro-injury that received intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion, lung water content was significantly reduced with hypertonic saline (73.9+/-1.1%; 359+/-10 mOsm/L) (mean+/-sd) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline treatment (76.1+/-0.53%; 298+/-4 mOsm/L) as was water content of small bowel (hypertonic saline, 69.1+/-5.8%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, 74.7+/-0.71%) and brain (hypertonic saline, 78.1+/-0.87%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, 79.2+/-0.38%) at 48 hrs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between serum osmolality and attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated increases in lung water content (r=-.647) CONCLUSIONS: Bowel, lung, and brain water content is attenuated with hypertonic saline when serum osmolality is &gt;350 mOsm/L without adverse effect on mortality in animals with and without neuro-injury </plain></SENT>
