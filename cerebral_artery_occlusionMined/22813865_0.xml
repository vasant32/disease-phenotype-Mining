<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage that occurs within the thrombolytic time window is increasingly appreciated to negatively impact the safety and efficacy profiles of thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the spatiotemporal evolution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage in this early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stage and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the topographical distribution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage and its association with tissue injury within the first 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the roles of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 1, 2, or 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 10 min reperfusion with fluorescence-labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> tissue infarction was evidenced by staining defect with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP-2/9 were assessed by gel and in situ zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2-h MCAO, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> leakage was seen in the ischemic ventromedial striatum and the preoptic area which showed ~70% CBF reduction, and expanded to other <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> regions including the cortex after 3-h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, high (2000 kDa) and low (70 kDa) molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> displayed almost identical leakage patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage, tissue infarction was first seen in the ischemic dorsal striatum and the parietal/insular cortex which experienced ~90% CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased gelatinolytic activity colocalized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> leakage, and MMP-2 was found to be the major enzymatic source on gelatin zymograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MMP inhibitor GM6001 significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> leakage induced by 2-h and 3-h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings reveal substantial differences in the topographic distribution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage and tissue infarction within the first 3 h after MCAO <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike ischemic neuronal damage, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage appears to develop faster in brain regions with moderately severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and MMP-2 contributes to this early ischemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage </plain></SENT>
