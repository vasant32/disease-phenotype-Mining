<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes local immune responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The temporal and spatial pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> was characterized immunocytochemically using monoclonal antibodies against CD5, a pan T cell marker, against CD4 and CD8 for subtyping of T lymphocytes, and ED1, a marker for macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD5+ T cells were present in some animals on the pial surface at day 1 and with increasing numbers mainly at the edges of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at days 3 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By day 14 their number had significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subtyping of T lymphocytes revealed that CD4+ helper/inducer T cells were rare, while CD8+ lymphocytes were abundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD8+ lymphocytes outnumbered CD5+ T cells indicating the presence of CD5-/CD8+ natural killer (NK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ED1+ macrophages primarily infiltrated the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> starting on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infiltrating leukocytes expressed leukocyte function associated antigen-1 and MHC class I and II antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early after infarction, increased expression of the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 was found on vessels and leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows that lymphocytes enter the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, but also in response to primarily 'non-immune' neuronal damage such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
