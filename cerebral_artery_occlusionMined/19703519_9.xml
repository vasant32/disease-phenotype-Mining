<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the concentration of BDNF in the Ad5HRE:BDNF-transfected culture media was 28-fold greater in a hypoxic condition than under normoxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of Ad5HRE:BDNF on ischemic brain injury in vivo, Ad5HRE:BDNF was injected into right caudate putamen of adult mice 7 days prior to 60 min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that exogenous BDNF expression was increased in the Ad5HRE-BDNF-treated group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the Ad5HRE:BDNF-treated group at 3 days after MCAO was significantly smaller than that of vehicle- or AdNull-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Ad5HRE:BDNF injection resulted in significantly improved sensorimotor scores 7 days after MCAO and induced a reduction in the number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons and TUNEL-positive cells, compared with vehicle- or AdNull-injection </plain></SENT>
