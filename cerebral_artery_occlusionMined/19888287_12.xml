<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n=41) were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), followed 1 day later by administration of magnetically labeled NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats with MCAo were assigned to one of three treatment groups targeted for cell transplantation intra-arterially (IA), intracisternally (IC), or intravenously (IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements consisting of T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo imaging were performed 24 h after MCAo, 4 h after cell injection, and once a day for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining was used to identify the labeled cells, 3D MRI to detect cell migration and distribution, and T2 map to assess lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial (IA) administration showed significantly increased migration, a far more diffuse distribution pattern, and a larger number of transplanted NPCs in the target brain than IC or IV administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, high mortality with IA delivery (IA: 41%; IC: 17%; IV: 8%) poses a serious concern for using this route of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals with smaller lesions at the time of transplantation have fewer grafted cells in the parenchyma </plain></SENT>
