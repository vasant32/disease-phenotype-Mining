<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We isolated Curculigoside A, the major bioactive compound present in Curculigo orchioides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of Curculigoside A on cultured neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y in vitro and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated SH-SY5Y cell line in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with Curculigoside A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For in vivo experiment, rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h, then followed by reperfusion for 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Curculigoside A reduced the oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, blocked TNF-α-induced NF-κB and IκB-α phosphorylation, and decreased HMGB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At doses higher than 10 mg/kg, Curculigoside A produced a significant neuroprotective potential in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Curculigoside A (20 mg/kg) demonstrated significant neuroprotective activity even after delayed administration at 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Curculigoside A 20 mg/kg attenuated histopathological damage, decreased cerebral Evans Blue extravasation, inhibited NF-κB activation and reduced HMGB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that Curculigoside A protects brain against I/R injury with a favorable therapeutic time-window by alleviating cerebral I/R injury and attenuating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown, and its protective effects may involve HMGB1 and NF-κB signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
