<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Oxymatrine, extracted from a traditional Chinese herb, Sophora flavescens Ait, has shown a variety of pharmacological actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have proved that oxymatrine protected brain from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the exact mechanisms of this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is to investigate the potential neuroprotection of oxymatrine and explore the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxymatrine was administered immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after MCAO, brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX), p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), phosphorylated p38 MAPK (phospho-p38 MAPK), and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) was measured by immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with MCAO group, oxymatrine dramatically reduced brain water content (P&lt;0.05) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these indices, the overexpressions of 12/15-LOX, phospho-p38 MAPK, and cPLA2 were significantly decreased in oxymatrine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But the expression of p38 MAPK was not affected at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oxymatrine protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO; this effect may be through down-regulation of 12/15-LOX, phospho-p38 MAPK, and cPLA2, but not through down-regulation of p38 MAPK </plain></SENT>
