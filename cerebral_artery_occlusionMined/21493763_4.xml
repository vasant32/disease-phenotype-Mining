<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unsuitable for IV thrombolysis may be considered for endovascular revascularization, particularly when baseline imaging suggests proximal cerebral vessel occlusion associated with minimal established infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective review describes the use of a self-expanding retrievable intracranial stent (Solitaire AB) for thrombectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated endovascularly by using the Solitaire stent were identified, followed by detailed review of data extracted from their imaging and clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization (TIMI grade ≥2) was achieved with Solitaire thrombectomy as the single treatment technique in 16 patients and in combination with urokinase or the Penumbra device in 9 of the remaining 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A favorable clinical outcome (mRS score of ≤2) was seen in 3 of 5 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 6 of 11 (55%) patients with ICA occlusion, and 2 of 10 patients with BA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy by using the Solitaire stent appears to be safe and is capable of achieving a high rate of recanalization and favorable clinical outcomes in patients presenting with proximal cerebral vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
