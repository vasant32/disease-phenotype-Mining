<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations on transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> suggested recovery of energy metabolism during early reperfusion, but followed by secondary energy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As disturbances of energy metabolism are reflected by changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water, the aim of the current study was to follow the dynamics of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> during 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and 10 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded in male Wistar rats inside the magnet using a remotely controlled thread occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T2-weighted images were performed repetitively, and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, perfusion, and T2 maps were calculated and normalized to the respective preischemic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume at each time point was defined by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> &lt; 80% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of 1-hour MCAO the hemispheric lesion volume was 22.3 +/- 9.0%; it decreased to 6.4 +/- 5.7% in the first 2 hours of reperfusion (P &lt; 0.01), but then increased again, and by the end of 10 hours of reperfusion reached 17.3 +/- 9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the end ischemic lesion volume significantly improved within 2 hours of reperfusion (from 65.7 +/- 1.2% to 90.1 +/- 6.7% of control), but later declined and decreased to 75.4 +/- 7.3% of control by the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pixels with secondary deterioration of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> showed a continuous increase of T2 value during the first 2 hours of reperfusion in spite of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> improvement, indicating improving cytotoxic, but generation of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of the perfusion level was not observed during 10 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the improvement of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the early phase of reperfusion may be followed by secondary deterioration that was not caused by delayed hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
