<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age is the most important nonmodifiable risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, yet many preclinical models continue to examine only young male animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear how experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes change with aging and with biologic sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If sex differences are present, it is not known whether these reflect an intrinsic differing sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or are secondary to the loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We subjected both young and aging mice of both sexes to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young female mice had smaller <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> compared with age-matched males, an effect that was reversed by ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> damage increased with aging in female mice, whereas male mice had decreased damage after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability changes are correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, aging mice had significantly less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, an effect that was independent of sex and histologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in the cellular response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occur across the life span in both male and female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences need to be considered when developing relevant therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the majority of whom are elderly </plain></SENT>
