<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Slices cut in the coronal plane at the level of the anterior commissure were equilibrated for 1 h at 35 degrees C in a submersion chamber perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 4M K <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-filled glass microelectrode (15-30 M omega) was used to penetrate each slice at multiple sites in order to record spontaneous neuronal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the presence of an area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the slices was confirmed using tetrazolium salt stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous neuronal activity, mainly as spike discharges or depolarisation, was observed in slices prepared from lesioned (6), sham-operated (6) and control (6) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bursts of discharges were more consistently obtained and of larger amplitude and duration in the slices with focal areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> when compared with the shams and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations may be of relevance to the hypothesis that excitotoxic discharges of disinhibited neurones contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
