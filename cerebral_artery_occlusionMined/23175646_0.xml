<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although inflammatory immune cells clearly contribute to the development of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice, the failure to block neutrophil-associated injury in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials has discouraged further development of immunotherapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is renewed interest in a possible protective role for regulatory T- and B-cells that can suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and limit central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system damage induced by infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our failure to implicate CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T-cells in limiting brain lesion volume after MCAO turned our focus towards regulatory B-cells known to mediate protection against other inflammatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly demonstrated that B-cell deficient mice developed larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, higher mortality and more severe functional deficits compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, and had increased numbers of activated T-cells, macrophages, microglial cells, and neutrophils in the affected brain hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These MCAO-induced changes were completely prevented in B-cell-restored mice after transfer of highly purified WT B-cells but not IL-10-deficient B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our novel observations are the first to implicate IL-10-secreting B-cells as a major regulatory cell type in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and suggest that enhancement of regulatory B-cells might have application as a novel therapy for this devastating neurologic condition </plain></SENT>
