<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study establishes a therapeutic time window for combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to permanent intraluminal thread MCAO and animals were treated 2, 4 or 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> infusion (360 micromol/kg, then 120 micromol/kg/h) and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (35 degrees C) or with vehicle for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the 2 h time point, treatment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> alone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> alone were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 48 h after MCAO induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After permanent MCAO, combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by 54% at 2 h (P = 0.048) and by 39% at 4 h (P = 0.012), but there was no treatment effect detected at 6 h or in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> alone groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support our earlier work highlighting the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> when combined with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, even when treatment is delayed by several hours </plain></SENT>
