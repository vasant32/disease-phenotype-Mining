<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because cathepsin B is a prominent lysosomal protease found in brain parenchyma, the authors hypothesized that it may contribute to neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors measured the expression and spatial distribution of cathepsin B within the ischemic brain in 43 animals by means of immunohistochemical analysis in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin B activity was also measured within specific ischemic brain regions by using an in vitro assay (22 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors tested the therapeutic effect of preischemic intraventricular administration of stefin A, a cysteine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, on the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (15 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased cathepsin B immunoreactivity was detected exclusively within the ischemic neurons after 2 hours of reperfusion following a 2-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin B immunolocalization in the ischemic region decreased by 24 hours of reperfusion, but then increased by 48 hours of reperfusion because the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was infiltrated by inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased immunolocalization of cathepsin B in the inflammatory cells located in the necrotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core continued through 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cathepsin B enzymatic activity was significantly increased in the ischemic tissue at 2, 8, and 48 hours, but not at 24 hours of reperfusion after 2 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continuous intraventricular infusion of stefin A, before 2 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (15 animals), significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with control animals (12 animals): the percentage of hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 20+/-3.9 compared with 33+/-3.5 (standard error of the mean; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that neuronal cathepsin B undergoes increased expression and activation within 2 hours of reperfusion after a 2-hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and may be a mechanism contributing to neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular infusion of stefin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin B, significantly reduces cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats </plain></SENT>
