<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 72 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham-operated group , Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) group, Vehicle group and ADSC-treated group (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCAO model was established with the modified Longa's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after right MCAO, 30 μL of cell suspension containing 1×10(6); cells were injected into the lateral ventricle of ADSC-treated group and the same dose of PBS was given to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuron was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method and the expression of Bcl-2 and caspase-12 in ischemic region was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic region of ADSC-treated group were less than that in MCAO group and Vehicle group at 4 d, 7 d and 14 d post MCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with MCAO group and Vehicle group, the expression of Bcl-2 significantly up-regulated while caspase-12 expression significantly decreased in ADSC-treated group at any time point post MCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transplantation of ADSCs can reduce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of rats with cerebral ischemic injury partly by promoting the expression of Bcl-2 which participates in apoptotic signals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage and inhibiting the expression of caspase-12 which mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
