<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated whether intravenously (noninvasively) administered, GFP-labeled BMSCs would migrate into damaged brain tissue and improve neurological function after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after injury, the rats received an i.v. injection of culture medium or BMSCs isolated from adult Wistar rats expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours after injury and 1, 3, and 7 days after cell transplantation, neurological function was evaluated using a neurological severity scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 7, the brain scar size was determined using tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, and the implanted cells were identified using confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischemic region, as well as the spatial distribution of the implanted BMSCs relative to the native neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Implanted BMSCs migrated throughout the territory of the middle cerebral artery by 7 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most implanted cells were located in the scar area and border zone of the ischemic region, and some expressed the neuronal marker NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rats receiving BMSC transplantation exhibited reduced scar size, limited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and enhanced angiogenic factor expression and vascular density in the ischemic region relative to the control group, as well as significant improvements in the neurological severity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravenously administrated BMSCs facilitated the structural and functional recovery of neural tissue following ischemic injury, perhaps mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
