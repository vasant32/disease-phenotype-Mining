<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At this time, the pathophysiology of macrophage involvement and their role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> progression are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, T2- and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron-oxide</z:chebi> particles, have been used to understand the inflammatory cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies report that image enhancement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is from iron-laden macrophages; however, they do not account for potential blood-brain barrier disruption and nonspecific contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, spontaneously hypertensive rats were preloaded with Feridex 7 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, permitting the labeling of bone-marrow-derived macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional gradient-echo imaging showed average signal decreases of 13% to 23% in preloaded animals, concentrated on the lesion periphery and reaching a maximum on days 2 to 4 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed ED-2+, PB+, MHC-II+ and TNF-alpha+ perivascular macrophages (PVM), meningeal macrophages (MM), and choroid plexus macrophages (CPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ED-1+ and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="46645">IBA</z:chebi>+ tissue macrophages and/or activated microglia were located throughout the lesion, but were PB- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the following: (1) Feridex preloading permits tracking of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>)-resident macrophages (PVM, MM, and CPM) and (2) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-resident macrophages likely play an integral role in the inflammatory cascade through antigen presentation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further refinement of this method should permit noninvasive monitoring of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and potential evaluation of antiinflammatory therapies in preclinical models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
