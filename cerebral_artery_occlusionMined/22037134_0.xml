<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after transient and after permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats and to test the hypothesis that VNS-induced neuroprotection is due to changes in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced by either temporary proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (TMCAO) or permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulating electrodes were implanted on the cervical part of the right vagus nerve, and electrical stimulation was initiated 30 minutes after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and delivered for 30 seconds every 5 minutes for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the procedures were duplicated but no stimulus was delivered in control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was continuously monitored with laser speckle contrast imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A neurologic evaluation was undertaken after 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and animals were euthanized and neuronal damage evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic lesion volume was smaller in VNS-treated animals in both the temporary and permanent ischemic groups (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VNS-treated animals in TMCAO had better functional scores at 24 hours as compared with control animals (P&lt;.01), but there were no statistically significant differences in the neurobehavioral scores in PMCAO (P=.089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow changes in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not differ between the VNS-treated animals and control animals in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VNS offers neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both temporary and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism of this effect remains to be determined, alterations in cerebral blood flow do not appear to play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VNS could readily be translated to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
