<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the underlying neural cues may provide the basis for improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the contribution of brain macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral cortex, MIF is predominantly found in neurons, particularly in parvalbumin interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following pMCAo, MIF increases around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core, where it is located to neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Housing rats in an EE after pMCAo resulted in a decrease of MIF protein levels in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, which was accompanied by an increase in parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that MIF is part of a signaling network involved in brain plasticity, and elevated neuronal and/or astrocytic MIF levels repress the recovery of sensory-motor function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Downregulating MIF could constitute a new therapeutic approach to promote recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
