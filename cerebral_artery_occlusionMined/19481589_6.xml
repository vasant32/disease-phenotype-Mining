<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytokine transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) has proangiogenic and proneurogenic effects and can potentially reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we administered TGF alpha or vehicle directly into the area surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in female mice that received gender-mismatched bone marrow transplants from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing males prior to undergoing permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newborn cells were tracked with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunohistochemistry at 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied the ingress of bone marrow-derived cells into the ischemic brain to determine whether such cells contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> or neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured at 90 days poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that TGF alpha led to significant increments in the number of newborn neurons and glia in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TGF alpha also led to significant increments in the number of bone marrow-derived cells entering into the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of these cells did not label with BrdU and represented endothelial cells that incorporated into blood vessels in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced in animals treated with TGF alpha compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TGF alpha can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, neurogenesis and neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At least part of the pro-angiogenic effect appears to be secondary to the incorporation of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells into blood vessels in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone </plain></SENT>
