<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that reduction of leukocytes in an ischemic lesion reduces ischemic brain damage, we measured the effect of administration of an anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody on ischemic brain damage after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 expression increased in the ischemic lesion, and the lesion volume was significantly reduced by 41% in the anti-ICAM-1 antibody group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly reduced in the cortices of the anti-ICAM-1 antibody group compared with the control animals (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that administration of anti-ICAM-1 antibody results in a significant reduction of ischemic brain damage concomitant with a reduction of PMNs in the lesion after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
