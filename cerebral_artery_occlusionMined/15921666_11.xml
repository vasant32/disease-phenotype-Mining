<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the effect of dantrolene, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on ER stress response and ischemic brain injury, we investigated changes in ER stress-related molecules, that is phosphorylated form of double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (p-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>), phosphorylated form of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (p-eIF2alpha), activating transcription factor-4 (ATF-4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) in the peri-ischemic area and ischemic core region of rat brain after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and TUNEL-positive cells were significantly reduced at 24 h of reperfusion by treatment with dantrolene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivities for p-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>, p-eIF2alpha, ATF-4, and CHOP were increased at the ischemic peripheral region after MCAO, which were partially inhibited by dantrolene treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that dantrolene significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and provided neuroprotective effect on rats after transient MCAO by reducing ER stress-mediated apoptotic signal pathway activation in the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
