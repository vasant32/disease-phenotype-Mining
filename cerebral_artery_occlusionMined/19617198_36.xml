<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) promote recovery in animal models with delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via a number of indirect bystander effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive knowledge of how transplanted NPCs exert their therapeutic effects is still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effects of a delayed transplantation of adult syngenic NPCs--injected intravenously 72 h after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>--on neurological recovery, histopathology and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPC-transplanted mice showed a significantly improved recovery from 18 days post-transplantation (dpt) onwards, which persisted throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A small percentage of injected NPCs accumulated in the brain, integrating mainly in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> boundary zone, where most of the NPCs remained undifferentiated up to 30 dpt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis revealed a hitherto unreported very delayed neuroprotective effect of NPCs, becoming evident at 10 and 30 dpt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue survival was associated with downregulation of markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, glial scar formation and neuronal apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data highlight the relevance of very delayed degenerative processes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brain that are intimately associated with inflammatory and glial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These processes may efficaciously be antagonized by (stem) cell-based strategies at time-points far beyond established therapeutic windows for pharmacological neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
