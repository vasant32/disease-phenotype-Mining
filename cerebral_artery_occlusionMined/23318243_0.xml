<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated previously that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52288">lysophosphatidic acid</z:chebi>-1 (LPA1) receptor plays a crucial role in the initiation of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain through the alternation of pain-related genes/proteins expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by left transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) for 15 min causes the hypersensitive responses (paw withdrawal) to the nociception by electrical stimuli to the paw by use of Neurometer <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypersensitivity or neuropathic pain was only observed by the stimulation with 250 and 2000, but not 5 Hz, which are the characterized sine-wave frequencies of Aδ-, Aβ- or C-fibers respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significant neuropathic pain was observed from day 2 through week 2 on the right paw after tMCAO, while there was slight but significant pain sensitivity on the left paw at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropathic pain on the contralateral side at week 2 after tMCAO was completely abolished in LPA1-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LPA1 receptor signaling plays key roles in the development of central neuropathic pain following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as well as the peripheral neuropathic pain following partial sciatic nerve injury </plain></SENT>
