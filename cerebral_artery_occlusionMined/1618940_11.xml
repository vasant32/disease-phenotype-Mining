<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured in the cortical barrel fields bilaterally by laser Doppler blood flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) whole mount preparations was used to verify the surgical lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, rCBF was equivalent on the two sides in shams, after selective sensory denervation, or in parasympathetically sectioned animals exhibiting small decreases (less than or equal to 30%) in immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (VIP)-containing fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> parasympathetic denervation, decreases in perfusion pressure were accompanied by greater reductions in rCBF on the lesioned side; changes in vascular resistance were also attenuated on that side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (PaCO2 50 mm Hg), however, was symmetrical and robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of impaired neurogenic vasodilation on the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured 24 h following tandem <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in denervated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was larger after selective parasympathetic sectioning (sham, 156 +/- 27 vs. 196 +/- 32 mm3, respectively) but only in those denervated animals demonstrating greater than or equal to 40% decrease in immunoreactive VIP-containing fibers within the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower than expected blood flow/perfusion pressure in the cortex distal to an occluded blood vessel may relate the observed blood flow responses to the occurrence of larger cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in parasympathetically denervated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If true, the findings suggest a novel role for neurogenic vasodilation in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in rCBF regulation within the periinfarction zone </plain></SENT>
