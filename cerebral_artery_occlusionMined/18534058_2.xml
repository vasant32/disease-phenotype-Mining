<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of intraventricular pre-treatment with recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors encoding VEGF (rAAV-VEGF) on early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: rAAV-VEGF, rAAV-null or physiologic saline was delivered into the lateral ventricle of 93 Wistar rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks later, the rats were subjected to tMCAO for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the early stage following ischemic reperfusion, intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain water content were measured to make a correlation analysis, T2-weighted MRI was performed to observe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> volume, and TTC-derived cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and modified neurological severity scores (NSS) were determined to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rAAV-VEGF in tMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four hours following tMCAO, the rAAV-VEGF group, with VEGF overexpression in the rats brain, showed a significantly increase in ICP, brain water content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> volume compared with two control groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ICP significantly correlated with the brain water content in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups during 24 hours following tMCAO (r=0.93, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours following tMCAO, a 1.3-fold larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and 1.3-fold higher NSS were observed in the rAAV-VEGF group than both control groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that intraventricular rAAV-VEGF pre-treatment can result in deleterious intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and augment secondary ischemic insults at the early stage of tMCAO, and pre-ischemic VEGF gene transfer via intraventricular approach may not be a favorable therapeutic strategy for tMCAO which should be adopted with caution or avoided in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
