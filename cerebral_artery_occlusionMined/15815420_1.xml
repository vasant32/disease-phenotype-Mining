<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats were given one of the following doses of intrathecal L-644,711 during 180 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 120 min of reperfusion: control, vehicle only; dose I, 100 microg/kg: dose II, 200 microg/kg; dose III, 250 mug/kg; or dose IV, 320 microg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the 5-h period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, the brains were analyzed for brain injury with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by microgravimetry (specific gravity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no between-group differences in specific gravity (brain water content) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain injury (% of the hemisphere ipsilateral to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) was less (p &lt;0.05) in rats that received the 250 (35 +/- 5%, mean +/- SD) or 320 microg/kg (36 +/- 6%) doses of L-644,711 vs. the control group (47 +/- 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>L-644,711 has been hypothesized to affect brain injury by improving the neuronal acid-base state, inhibiting astroglial swelling, decreasing neutrophil aggregation, or reducing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microgravimetric data do not support astroglial swelling as a primary mechanism of decreased brain injury </plain></SENT>
