<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their proliferation is up-regulated by growth factors or cytokines under some pathological conditions, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> orthovanadate (SOV), a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, can up-regulate tyrosine kinase-linked growth factor receptor signaling via the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residue</z:chebi> dephosphorylation, it may be capable of enhancing progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of SOV on progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ), we injected rats intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 12.5 or 25 mM SOV or BrdU and saline (control) on days 1 to 7 after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of BrdU-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ showed a significant SOV dose-dependent increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was found only in the ipsilateral and not contralateral SVZ, and it was not found in nonischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double immunolabeling with BrdU and double cortin, a marker of migrating neuroblast, revealed that the density of double-positive cells increased significantly in an SOV dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling staining suggested that the SOV-induced increase was not due to antiapoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SOV also significantly increased the density of cells positive for BrdU and phosphorylated Akt and BrdU and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We postulate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> triggers off the proliferation of SVZ cells by bioactive factors such as growth factors and that SOV enhances the proliferation of only triggered-off SVZ cells with Akt and ERK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that SOV may aid in the self-repair of the postischemic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
