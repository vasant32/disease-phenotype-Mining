<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the mechanism of neuroprotection is the inhibition of 'secondary phase' peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi>), recently shown to recur 6--24 h post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were implanted with intrathecal (i.t.) catheters for drug delivery and DC-compatible electrodes for continuous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> monitoring and subjected to transient (2 h) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two groups (C(40)C and C(20)C), continuous infusion of CGX--1007 was administered over 8--24 h post-occlusion at 0.1 microg/h (0.04 nmol/h) following either a 40- or 20-nmol bolus dose at 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another group (C(40)S) received the 40-nmol bolus followed by saline infusion, and a control group received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal drug treatment reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes relative to controls by 61%, 31%, and 10% in C(40)C, C(40)S, and C(20)C groups, respectively, but also induced dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and elevated mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats had <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> rates similar to the control group prior to treatment, but following treatment secondary phase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> were reduced by 47--57% in each drug group compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because several animals exhibited <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> inhibition but no neuroprotection, there was no significant correlation between these endpoints across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, drug-treated animals that did not exhibit secondary phase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PIDs</z:chebi> prior to treatment had significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and reduced subsequent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8066">PID</z:chebi> activity than corresponding control rats </plain></SENT>
