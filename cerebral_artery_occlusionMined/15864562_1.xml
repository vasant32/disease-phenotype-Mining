<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of CRF, CRF-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and the CRF broad spectrum <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> DPhe</z:chebi>-CRF on CBF have been investigated under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic conditions and in the margins of focal ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experiments were carried out in anaesthetised and ventilated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in CBF after subarachnoid microapplication of CRF and related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were assessed with a laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ischaemic animals, agents were injected approximately 60 minutes after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microapplication of CRF and related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats into the subarachnoid space produced sustained concentration-dependent increases in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was attenuated by co-application with<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> DPhe</z:chebi>-CRF, which did not alter CBF itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second microapplication of CRF 30 min after the first failed to produce increases in CBF in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microapplication of CRF in the subarachnoid space overlying the ischaemic cortex effected minor increases in CBF whereas<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> D-Phe</z:chebi>-CRF had no significant effect on CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of the CRF peptidergic system increases CBF in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeated activation of CRF receptors results in tachyphylaxis of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CRF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response is still present after MCAo in the ischaemic penumbra, suggesting that the CRF peptidergic system may modulate CBF in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
