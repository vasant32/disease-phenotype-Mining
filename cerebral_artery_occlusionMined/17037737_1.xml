<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SD male rats were randomly divided into three group: sham operation group, ischemic model group and Ligustrazine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was established by placement of an intraluminal filament at the origin of left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ligustrazine was administered intraperitoneally with a dose of 80 mg/kg daily starting at 2 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BrdU (50 mg/kg) was injected once a day intraperitoneally starting at 4 hours after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Number of BrdU-positive cells and expression of doublecortin (DCX) in subventricular zone (SVZ) were measured by immunohistochemistry on day 7, 14, 24 after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham operation group, BrdU-positive cells in ischemic model group increased on day 7, reached the peak on day 14, then decreased on day 21 after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 7 and 14, the numbers of BrdU-positive cells in Ligustrazine group were markedly augmented and significantly more than those in ischemic model group (P &lt; 0.01), but decreased on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressions of DCX in SVZ in ischemic model group were enhanced on day 7 with lasting into day 14, and reduced on day 21, but still higher than those in sham operation group on day 7, 14, and 21, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressions of DCX in SVZ in Ligustrazine group increased gradually along with prolong of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and kept the high level up to day 21 after operation, and were higher than those in ischemic model group on day 14 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Ligustrazine may promote the cells of SVZ, which the adult rats suffer from the focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, to go into cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
