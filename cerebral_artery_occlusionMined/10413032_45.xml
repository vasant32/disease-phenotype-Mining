<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of lesioned pyramidal neurones found in the hippocampal CA1 region of gerbils subjected to bilateral carotid occlusion for 5 minutes decreased from 92+/-10% in vehicle-treated animals to 7+/-6% after mNBA (400 mg/kg intraperitoneally, three times at 1, 30, and 180 minutes after occlusion) or to 10+/-11% after Ro 61-8048 (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally, three times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes also was found when the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> hydroxylase inhibitors were given to rats after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (from 207+/-111 mm3 in vehicle-treated rats to 82+/-18 and to 62+/-57 mm3 in rats treated with mNBA, 400 mg/kg intraperitoneally, or with Ro 61-8048, 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The administration of mNBA (400 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or Ro 61-8048 (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to gerbils with a dialysis probe in their dorsal hippocampus or to rats with a dialysis probe in their parietal cortex significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18344">kynurenic acid</z:chebi> concentration in the dialysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> hydroxylase could be a new avenue to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
