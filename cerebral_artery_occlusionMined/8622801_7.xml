<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen rats were imaged before and during 30 min of endovascular middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at 15 min, and 23.5 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both hemisphere and basal ganglia signal intensity ratio increased significantly from baseline during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, decreased significantly from ischemic levels during early reperfusion, and increased again at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, signal intensity ratio during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or after 45 min of reperfusion did not correlate statistically with diffusion-weighted-signal intensity ratio at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both hemisphere signal intensity ratio and basal ganglia signal intensity ratio at 15 min of reperfusion correlated, but only moderately, with diffusion-weighted-signal intensity ratio at 24 h (r = 0.52, p &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although lesion areas during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were comparable to those observed at 24 h, lesion areas at both 15 and 45 min of reperfusion were significantly smaller than those observed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 24 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, sequential imagining demonstrated partial resolution and delayed recurrence of magnetic resonance-defined ischemic lesions during reperfusion after brief focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
