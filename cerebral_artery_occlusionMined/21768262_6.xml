<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complex cellular interactions leading from thromboembolic vessel occlusion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development within the brain parenchyma in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are poorly understood, which translates into only one approved effective treatment, thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, however, patients can develop progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite reperfusion of previously occluded major intracranial arteries, a process referred to as 'reperfusion injury' which can be reproduced in the mouse model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although pathological platelet and coagulant activity have long been recognized to be involved in the initiation of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, their contribution to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> maturation remained elusive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further experimental work indicates that these pathways in conjunction with coagulation factor XII (FXII)-driven processes orchestrate a 'thrombo-inflammatory' cascade in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that results in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
