<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gene therapy may show promise for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, but invasive techniques such as intraventricular or intracerebral injection of therapeutic genes may have limited applicability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to develop systemic gene therapy using macrophages infiltrating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to deliver and express the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats, an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid conjugate in liposomes was injected via the femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also constructed a bicistronic plasmid vector for fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) as well as EGFP, administering it in other rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGFP expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain was absent but was strong in macrophages accumulating along the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FGF-2 protein production was induced in macrophages along the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border after injection of bicistronic FGF-2 and EGFP plasmid vector; this stimulated proliferation of neural progenitors in the subventricular zone in the ischemic hemisphere compared with control plasmid vectors (61.7+/-5.2 versus 42.2+/-5.5 cells per mm2, n=4 each, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic gene transfer by liposome to macrophages infiltrating an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may prove useful for gene therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
