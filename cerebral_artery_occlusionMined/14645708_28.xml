<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that induction of mucosal tolerance to E-selectin, a cytokine-inducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule restricted to activating blood vessels, prevents ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in spontaneously hypertensive, genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone (SHR-SP) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now examine whether mucosal tolerance to E-selectin has protective effects in ischemic brain damage after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in SHR-SP rats and whether these effects are related to generation of regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to intranasal administration of E-selectin every other day for 10 days (single tolerization group) or on two tolerization schedules separated by 11 days (booster tolerization group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control groups received PBS on corresponding schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO was performed 48 h after the last dose of E-selectin or PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 45.8% and 37.9% (P &lt; 0.05) decreases of infarction volume in the E-selectin booster group compared with the PBS group at 6 and 48 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single tolerization with E-selectin had only a slight trend toward a decrease in infarction volume (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD8-positive cells were decreased in brains of E-selectin booster animals (46.6%, P &lt; 0.01) compared with controls; splenocyte-culture supernatant levels of IL-10 were increased (59.3%, P &lt; 0.05) in E-selectin booster animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A decrease of infarction volume (34%, P &lt; 0.05) was also observed in SHR-SP rats subjected to MCAO after adoptive transfer of splenocytes from E-selectin-tolerized compared with PBS-tolerized donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that, in addition to preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, mucosal tolerance to E-selectin is cytoprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, immunomodulation targeted to activated blood vessel segments can both reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence and attenuate brain damage if a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> supervenes </plain></SENT>
