<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of patients with and without early CT findings treated with IV versus intra-arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initial and 24-hour CT scans of the head were evaluated in 83 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (66 on IV rtPA, 17 on IA rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time permitting, a CT angiogram was performed immediately after the initial CT scan to ascertain major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics and etiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, times to thrombolysis and CT scan, baseline (prethrombolysis) and 24-hour National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) score, discharge NIHSS score and 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial CT of these patients was examined for early signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour scan was reviewed for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and persistence of HCMAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A favorable outcome, indicated by a significant improvement in the discharge NIHSS score, was noted with IA rtPA, irrespective of the presence (p = 0.001) or absence (p = 0.01) of HCMAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A less favorable outcome in discharge NIHSS score was noted with IV rtPA in patients with HCMAS (p = not significant) than those without the sign (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar proportion of patients with HCMAS exhibited a neurological improvement at 24 h as those without the sign in the IA rtPA group (p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a smaller proportion of patients with HCMAS exhibited a neurological improvement at 24 h than those without the sign in the IV rtPA group (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results were similar using 90-day mRS &lt;/=1 as an indicator of significant persistent improvement (p = 1.0 for IA rtPA and 0.04 for IV rtPA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, patients with HMCAS appeared to respond better to IA than IV rtPA </plain></SENT>
