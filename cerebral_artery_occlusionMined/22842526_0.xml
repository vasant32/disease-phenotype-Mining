<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been proved that pre-treatment with leonurine could protect brain tissue against ischemic injury by exerting <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effects and regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this protective effect applies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of leonurine and the underlying mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leonurine was administered intraperitoneally at 7.5 or 15 mg/kg/d at 2h after surgery, then once daily thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, brain water content, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured at 24h, 72 h, and 7d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content were also measured by spectrophotometer to evaluate oxidative reactions, and the expression of uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4), Bcl-2, and Bax were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemical staining (IHC), and western blot, while the ultrastructure of the mitochondria were observed under transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Leonurine significantly alleviated neurological deficit, decreased brain water content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, which was accompanied by decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and Bax, increased activities of SOD, CAT, UCP4, and Bcl-2, and restored ultrastructure of mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The results showed that leonurine protected brain injury by increased activities of UCP4, SOD, CAT and Bcl-2, decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and Bax, and ameliorated ultrastructure of mitochondria in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
