<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral circulation, endothelin-A receptor activation mediates marked prolonged vasoconstriction whereas endothelin-B (ETB) receptor activation effects dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to some peripheral vascular beds, ET(B) receptor-induced vasoconstriction has not yet been demonstrated in brain vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study in chloralose-anesthetized cats, with perivascular microapplications of ET(B) selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (BQ-3020) and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (BQ-788), we investigated whether ET(B) receptor-mediated constriction could be uncovered in cortical arterioles in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dilator response to ET(B) receptor activation is preserved in postischemic cerebral arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first microapplication of the selective ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> BQ-3020 (1 micromol/L) onto a pial cortical arteriole elicited marked dilation (caliber increased by 26.3 +/- 15.1% from preinjection baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second application of BQ-3020 (10-minute interval) onto the same vessel failed to evoke any significant vasomotor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent (third and fourth) adventitial microapplication of the ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> on the same arteriolar site effected a significant constriction of cerebral arterioles (-15.3 +/- 12.7% and -9.7 +/- 6.3% from preinjection baseline, respectively, at 20 and 30 minutes after the first application) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pial arterioles did not display tachyphylaxis to repeated applications of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (10 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perivascular application of the ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> BQ-788 (0.001 to 1 micromol/L) had no effect on arteriolar caliber per se but blocked both BQ-3020-induced dilation (inhibitory concentration approximately 5 nmol/L) and vasoconstriction elicited by repeated activation of ET(B) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, most of the arterioles examined displayed a sustained dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The microapplication of BQ-3020 into the perivascular space surrounding postischemic dilated arterioles elicited a constriction of a similar magnitude to that induced by application of CSF (-17 +/- 7% and -17 +/- 7% from preinjection baseline, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The adventitial microapplication of the ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (BQ-788, 0.1 micromol/L) on postocclusion dilated pial arterioles effected no change in the arteriolar caliber when compared with preinjection baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This BQ-788-induced response was significantly different from that induced by perivascular microinjection of CSF (P &lt; 0.001, analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These investigations indicate that (1) repeated activation of ET(B) receptors displays tachyphylaxis of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response but also uncovers significant constriction of cerebral arterioles in vivo; (2) the ability of BQ-3020 to elicit dilation is lost within 30 minutes of induced focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; and (3) ET(B)-mediated contractile tone contributes in a small but significant manner in limiting postischemia dilation of cortical pial arterioles </plain></SENT>
