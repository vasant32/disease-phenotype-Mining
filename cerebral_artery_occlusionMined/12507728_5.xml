<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Filipin and Nile Red stainings were performed to detect mainly FC and NLs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double stainings for Nile Red plus ED1, MAP2, or GFAP were performed in order to identify cell type of positive stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Filipin stanining decreased during 1-7 day and lost at 21 day after transient MCAO in the ischemic core, but did not change in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nile Red positive droplets reached the maximum at 7 day after transient MCAO and gradually decreased in the core, while the peak time delayed in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAP2 immunoreactivity lost at 7 day in the core, and increased in the penumbra during 7-56 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most Nile Red positive droplets were double positive for ED1 in the core, and were localized within GFAP positive cells in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that changes of FC and NLs are different temporally and spatially between the core and penumbra in relation to degenerative and regenerative neural processes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
