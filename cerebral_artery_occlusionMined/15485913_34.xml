<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces a highly conserved homeostatic response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eukaryotic cells, termed the unfolded-protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the characterization of stanniocalcin 2 (STC2), a mammalian homologue of a calcium- and phosphate-regulating hormone first identified in fish, as a novel target of the UPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of STC2 gene is rapidly upregulated in cultured cells after exposure to tunicamycin and thapsigargin, by ATF4 after activation of the ER-resident kinase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, STC2 expression is also activated in neuronal cells by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> but not by several cellular stresses unrelated to the UPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of another homologue, STC1, is only upregulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> independent of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> or ATF4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies revealed that rat cortical neurons rapidly upregulate STC2 after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, siRNA-mediated inhibition of STC2 expression renders N2a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells and HeLa cells significantly more vulnerable to apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after treatment with thapsigargin, and overexpression of STC2 attenuated thapsigargin-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, induced STC2 expression is an essential feature of survival component of the UPR </plain></SENT>
