<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ROS cause <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are deleterious to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So diminishing the production of free radicals and scavenging them may be a successful therapeutic strategy for the protection of brain tissue in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of sesamin (Sn) to reduce brain injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of adult male Wistar rat was occluded for 2h and reperfused for 22h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sesamin is the most abundant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25036">lignan</z:chebi> in sesame seed oil is a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sesamin (30 mg/kg) was given orally twice, 30 min before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 12h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial investigations revealed that sesamin reduced the neurological deficits in terms of behavior and reduced the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive species (TBARS), and protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> (PC) in the different areas of the brain when compared with the MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly depleted level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and its dependent enzymes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase [GPx] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase [GR]) in MCAO group were protected significantly in MCAO group treated with sesamin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that sesamin may be able to attenuate the ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and plays a crucial role as a neuroprotectant in regulating levels of reactive oxygen species in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, sesamin may be a potential compound in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
