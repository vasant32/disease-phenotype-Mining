<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By 24 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion there was little expression of NGFI-A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the core of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, but the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was still induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of cortex outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion also induced this gene in subcortical structures: ipsilateral medial striatum; most of thalamus including medial and lateral geniculate nuclei; substantia nigra; and hippocampus at 4 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion which generally disappeared by 24 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of these structures, except for the striatum, are not supplied by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that changes in brain gene expression can occur in many regions remote from an infarction </plain></SENT>
