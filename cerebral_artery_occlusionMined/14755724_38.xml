<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PWI volume is typically substantially larger than the DWI volume shortly after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, that is, a diffusion/ perfusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to follow the evolution of the diffusion/ perfusion mismatch in permanent and 60- minute temporary focal experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models in Sprague-Dawley rats using the intraluminal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI and arterial spin-labeled PWI were performed at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes after occlusion and lesion volumes (mm(3)) calculated At 24 hours after MCAO, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO group, the lesion volume on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps was significantly smaller than that on the cerebral blood flow maps through the first 60 minutes after MCAO; but not after 90 minutes of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>, the diffusion/perfusion mismatch was similar, but after reperfusion, the lesion volumes on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and cerebral blood flow maps became much smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in 24- hour <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes between the permanent and temporary occlusion groups </plain></SENT>
