<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effects of scutellarin (Scu) on liver function after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were pretreated with Scu for 7 d and then subjected to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase (XOD), alanine transaminase (ALT), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST) in serum or liver tissues and the activities of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi>-dependent monooxygenases (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYPs</z:chebi>) in liver tissues after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vehicle-treated rats, XOD, ALT, and AST activities (P&lt;0.01) in serum and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level (P&lt;0.05) in liver tissues were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elevated but were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) by Scu pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NO levels in serum and liver tissues were decreased (P&lt;0.01) dramatically in vehicle-treated rats and returned to the levels in the sham-operated animals when pretreated with Scu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SOD (P&lt;0.05) and GSH-PX (P&lt;0.01) activities in cytosol fraction were increased significantly by Scu pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a loss of CYP3A activity (P&lt;0.01), but no changes of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 activities in liver were observed after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scu had no effect on them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that pretreatment with Scu could attenuate hepatocellular damage elicited by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats and this protection is in major part by its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
