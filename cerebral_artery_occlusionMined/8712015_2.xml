<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug has protective action against ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effect of NBP on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and neurological deficits after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by permanent occlusion of the proximal portion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) according to the technique of Tamura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of neurological deficits was evaluated by the method of Bederson </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological changes in neuronal change after MCAO in rats were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and the score of neurological deficits after MCAO were reduced significantly following intraperitoneal pretreatment or pre- and post-treatment with NBP 20 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>kg-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment with NBP 10 or 20 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>kg-1(i.p.), or 20,40 or 80 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>kg-1 (po) 15 min and even 2 h (20 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>kg-1, i.p.) after MCAO also markedly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and the score of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, no effect was found when NBP (20 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>kg-1) was injected intraperitoneally 4 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (0.5 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>kg-1, i.p.), a non-competitive <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor, significantly reduced the size of infarction and the score of neurological deficits in rats subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The potency of NBP in reducing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and neurological deficits was found to be quite similar to that of MK-801 (0.5 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>kg-1, i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>No neuroprotective effect of nimodipine (1.0 mg  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>kg-1, sc) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Generally, the potency of NBP in protecting rats from ischemic neurological damage is equal to that of MK-801 and is more powerful than that of Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Side effects of NBP in behavior was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NBP seems to be a hopeful drug for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
