<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased intracellular calcium accumulation is known to potentiate ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether endogenous calcium-binding proteins can attenuate this injury has not been clearly established, and existing data are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calbindin D28K (CaBP) is one such intracellular calcium buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether CaBP overexpression is neuroprotective against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bipromoter, replication-incompetent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus vectors that encoded the genes for cabp and, as a reporter gene, lacZ were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral striatal injections of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector 12 to 15 hours before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the use of an intraluminal occluding suture, animals were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 47 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were harvested and stained with X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> (to visualize beta-galactosidase, the gene product of lacZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of remaining virally transfected, X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>-stained neurons in both the ischemic and contralateral striata were counted and expressed as the percentage of surviving neurons in the ischemic striatum relative to the contralateral nonischemic striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Striatal neuron survivorship among cabp-injected animals was 53.5+/-4.1% (n=10) versus 26.8+/-5.4% among those receiving lacZ (n=9) (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector-mediated overexpression of CaBP leads to neuroprotection in this model of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that CaBP overexpression protects neurons in a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
