<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> were given as pre-treatment, the effect of treatment being evaluated by 2,3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining after 3 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both FK506 and CsA reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to less than 1/3 of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of CsA's known effect as a blocker of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transition (MPT) pore, it failed to give a more robust effect than FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If anything, FK506, which lacks an effect on the MPT pore, had a more pronounced anti-ischemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in this model of infarction, an MPT may not play a major pathogenetic role </plain></SENT>
