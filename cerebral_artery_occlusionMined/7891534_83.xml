<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the trace of a tensor is invariant upon rotation, measurement of this trace can reduce the orientation effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A family of imaging pulse sequences is presented in which the signal intensity is weighted by the trace of the diffusion tensor in a single scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methods are demonstrated for chicken gizzard in several orientations with respect to the gradient frame of reference, and for ischemic injury in cat brain after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the techniques to the presence of background gradients is measured and discussed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, pulse sequences are suggested that provide reliable diffusion constants in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of the techniques for clinical application is also evaluated </plain></SENT>
