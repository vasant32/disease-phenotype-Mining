<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and hemodynamics in a well-defined 3-vessel occlusion model of the rat by using diffusion- (DWI), perfusion-, and T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were subjected to 60 minutes of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI and T2WI were used to characterize the extent of the ischemic lesion from 4.5 hours to 14 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery method and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI were used to evaluate the temporal changes in relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly selected and killed at each time point for investigation of vascular density and for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic lesions developed in the ipsilateral cortex, as demonstrated by DWI and T2WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF was significantly increased in the ipsilateral cortex, especially in the cortical outer layer from day 1 to day 14, and peaked on day 7 (P&lt;0.05), while CBV was significantly increased on day 7 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vascular density on the ipsilateral brain surface was gradually increased from day 1 to day 5, peaked on day 7, and then decreased on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histology study showed pannecrosis in the cortex from day 1 to day 5 and partial liquefaction of the necrotic tissues on days 7 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A delayed increase in both CBF and CBV is documented in the ipsilateral cortex after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and such an increase may be associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
