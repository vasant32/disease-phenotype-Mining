<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An infarction model was induced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: physical exercise group (n = 30) undergoing running wheel exercise daily after MCAO, control group (n = 30) and sham-operated group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter two groups were fed in standard cages without any special training exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were scarified at Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 35 for the evaluation of neural function by neurological severity scores (NSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And the synaptic ultrastructures at peri-infarction region were examined by specific marker synaptophysin (SYN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Synaptic ultrastructures at peri-infarction region were observed in both the control and exercise training groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes were relatively intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And the presynaptic membranes had more synaptic vesicles from Day 7 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of SYN positive cells significantly increased in the exercise training group (21 d: 0.8 ± 0.1; 35 d: 0.7 ± 0.1) versus those in the control group (21 d: 0.4 ± 0.1; 35 d: 0.5 ± 0.1) at Days 21 and 35 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neurological severity scores in the exercise training group (7 d: 7.8 ± 0.8; 14 d: 5.6 ± 0.8; 21 d: 3.3 ± 0.8; 35 d: 3.0 ± 0.8) showed a quicker declination versus those in the control group (7 d: 8.8 ± 0.7; 14 d: 7.7 ± 0.9; 21 d: 6.9 ± 0.8; 35 d: 4.2 ± 0.8) from Day 7 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exercise training plays an important role in the recovery of damaged neural function and synaptic plasticity after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
