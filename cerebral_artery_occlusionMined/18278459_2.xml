<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by temporary middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental rats induced by MCAO were sacrificed on 7th and 14th day after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain was taken out at 7th and 14th day after injury, and the expression of Cyclin D1, E, A and B1 in neurons of cerebral cortex or hippocampal CA1 region was detected by immunofluorescence and confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that after MCAO, in the ipsilateral CA1 subfield of hippocampus the expression of Cyclin D1, E, A and B1 in neurons was significantly gradually up-regulated at 7th and 14th day after reperfusion (P&lt;0.05) as compared with that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ipsilateral cerebral cortex the expression of Cyclin D1 and B1 in neurons was notably gradually down-regulated at 7th and 14th day, and that of Cyclin E and A was significantly up-regulated at 14th day after reperfusion as compared with that in control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that there was a differential sensitivity among neurons from different brain regions to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them re-enter into cell cycle after MCAO </plain></SENT>
