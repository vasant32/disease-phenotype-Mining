<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its efficacy, however, might be limited because of massive grafted-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transplantation, and its insufficient capability for tissue repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, interleukin 6 promotes a pro-survival signalling pathway through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether cellular reprogramming of neural stem cells with interleukin 6 facilitates the effectiveness of cell transplantation therapy in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neural stem cells harvested from the subventricular zone of foetal mice were preconditioned with interleukin 6 in vitro and transplanted into mouse brains 6 h or 7 days after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 6 preconditioning protected the grafted neural stem cells from ischaemic reperfusion injury through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-mediated upregulation of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, interleukin 6 preconditioning induced secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor from the neural stem cells through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, resulting in promotion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the ischaemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transplantation of interleukin 6-preconditioned neural stem cells significantly attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and improved neurological performance compared with non-preconditioned neural stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This interleukin 6-induced amelioration of ischaemic insults was abolished by transfecting the neural stem cells with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that preconditioning with interleukin 6, which reprograms neural stem cells to tolerate <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> after ischaemic reperfusion injury and to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, is a simple and beneficial approach for enhancing the effectiveness of cell transplantation therapy in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
