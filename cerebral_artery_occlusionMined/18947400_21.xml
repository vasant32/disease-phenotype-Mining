<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas IL-1beta is primarily neurotoxic in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, TNF-alpha may have neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether IL-1beta and TNF-alpha are synthesized by overlapping or segregated populations of cells after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to examine cellular co-expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha at 6, 12 and 24 hours after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice, validating the results by the use of bone marrow chimeric mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were expressed in largely segregated populations of CD11b+CD45dim microglia and CD11b+CD45high macrophages, with cells expressing both cytokines only rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of Gr1+ granulocytes producing IL-1beta or TNF-alpha was very low, and we observed no IL-1beta- or TNF-alpha-expressing T cells or astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results show that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha are produced by largely segregated populations of microglia and macrophages after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide evidence of a functional diversity among different subsets of microglia and macrophages that is potentially relevant to future design of anti-inflammatory therapies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
