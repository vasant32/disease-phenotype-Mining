<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The liver X receptors (LXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and act as transcriptional regulators of cholesterol metabolism in several tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work also has identified LXRs as potent antiinflammatory molecules in macrophages and other immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combined changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and inflammatory profiles are likely mediating the protective role of LXRs in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> injury like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These beneficial actions, however, have not been illustrated in other models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in which <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is an important pathophysiological feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We have studied LXR expression and function in the course of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that administration of the synthetic LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> GW3965 or TO901317 after the ischemic occlusion improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome as shown by decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume area and better neurological scores in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection observed with LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> correlated with decreased expression of proinflammatory genes in the brain and with reduced nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of function studies using LXRalpha,beta(-/-) mice demonstrated that the effect of LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> is receptor specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, infarcted brain area and inflammatory signaling were significantly extended in LXRalpha,beta(-/-) mice compared with control animals, indicating that endogenous LXR signaling mediates neuroprotection in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the transcriptional action of LXR as a protective pathway in brain injury and the potential use of LXR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> as therapeutic agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
