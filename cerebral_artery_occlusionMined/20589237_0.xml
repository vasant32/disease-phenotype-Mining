<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of oral administration of lysine (a basic amino acid), arginine, and their combination on ischemic insults (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and infarction) and hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining were performed 2 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control animals, the major edematous areas were observed in the cerebral cortex and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volumes associated with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were significantly reduced by lysine (2.0 g/kg), arginine (0.6 g/kg), or their combined administration (0.6 g/kg each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protective effects of these amino acids on infarction were comparable to the inhibitory effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these amino acids, even at low dose (0.6 g/kg), were effective to reduce hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the effects of in vivo microiontophoretic (juxtaneuronal) applications of these amino acids on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-evoked neuronal activity in the ventromedial hypothalamus were investigated in awake rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neuronal activity was robustly inhibited by microiontophoretic applications of lysine or arginine onto neuronal membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of oral ingestion of lysine and arginine against ischemic insults (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and infarction), especially in the cerebral cortex, and suggest that suppression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced neuronal activity might be the primary mechanism associated with these neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
