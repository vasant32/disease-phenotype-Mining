<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we focus on the flow monitoring technique: diffuse correlation spectroscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Representative clinical and pre-clinical studies from our laboratory illustrate the potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> blood flow indices in human brain and muscle is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> with arterial spin-labelled MRI, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT and Doppler ultrasound shows good agreement (0.50&lt;r&lt;0.95) over a wide range of tissue types and source detector distances, corroborating the potential of the method to measure perfusion non-invasively and in vivo at the microvasculature level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-optical measurements of cerebral oxygen metabolism in both rat brain, following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and human brain, during functional activation, are also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both situations, the use of combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> and diffuse optical spectroscopy/near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor changes in oxygen consumption by the tissue is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, recent results spanning from gene expression-induced angiogenic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment monitoring are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the research illustrates the capability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> to quantitatively monitor perfusion from bench to bedside, providing results that match up both with literature findings and with similar experiments performed with other techniques </plain></SENT>
