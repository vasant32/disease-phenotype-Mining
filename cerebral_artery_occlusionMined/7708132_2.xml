<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Light emitting diodes were used as light source which made the recording probe small and flexible enough to be placed on the brain surface tightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stable and reliable recording of the tissue oxygen saturation and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was ascertained in the experimental studies using middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model of rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the clinical studies, monitoring during bypass surgery detected rapid changes of local oxygen metabolism and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in ischaemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous and continuous monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration enables more practical analysis of brain circulation and oxygen metabolism in experimental and clinical situations </plain></SENT>
