<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that Stat3 is induced following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there is no evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> stimulates the expression of phosphorylated-Stat3 (p-Stat3), which can activate cytokine-mediated signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the changes in p-Stat3 expression following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in the p-Stat3 protein in the peripheral part of the ischemic area, starting from 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p-Stat3 immunoreactivity was detected only in neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglia, and p-Stat3-positive neurons were increased in number in the peripheral part of the ischemic area at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining with aTdT-mediated biotinylated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit and the p-Stat3 antibody indicated that p-Stat3-positive neurons were also TUNEL-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent immuno-electron microscopic observations showed that p-Stat3-positive neurons were at different stages of degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that the increased expression of p-Stat3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could play a crucial role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
