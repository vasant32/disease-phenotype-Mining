<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Persephin (Pspn), a recently cloned member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily (TGF-beta) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) subfamily, is distributed throughout the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system at extremely low levels and is thought to function as a survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic and spinal motor neurons in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that mice lacking Pspn by homologous recombination show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and behavior, but are hypersensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 300% increase in infarction volume was observed after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced Ca(2+) influx, thought to be a major component of ischemic neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, can be regulated directly by the Persephin protein (PSP) and that PSP can reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/reperfusion cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> can be prevented or markedly attenuated by administration of recombinant human PSP in vivo before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both mouse and rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that PSP is a potent modulator of excitotoxicity in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system with pronounced neuroprotective activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the view that PSP signaling can exert an important control function in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-mediated neurotoxicity, and also suggest that future therapeutic approaches may involve this novel trophic protein </plain></SENT>
