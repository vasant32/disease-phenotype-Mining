<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A combined therapeutic approach has been advocated repeatedly for treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clinical example of combined therapy is administration of nimodipine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> during temporary occlusion of a cerebral artery in neurovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated outstanding neuroprotective properties of a combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), tirilazad (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>), and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (MTH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we compared this treatment strategy with the customary treatment options in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (n=120) were subjected to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by an intraluminal filament (n=10 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, the customary treatment options (nimodipine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi>) were evaluated as monotherapy and in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, the customary and the new combination therapy (MTH) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33 degrees C) was maintained for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations were performed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was assessed histologically after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In experiment 1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was attenuated by 34% at maximum, with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> being the most effective drugs given as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, combined administration of the customary treatment options had no additive effect (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume -36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with MTH reduced total infarction by 73% and almost completely abolished cortical infarction (-91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the animals of this group had any residual neurological deficit at the end of the observation period (P&lt;0.05 versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of drugs (monotherapy or in combination) most commonly used for neuroprotection during neurovascular surgery is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The newly proposed combination therapy (<z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, tirilazad, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>), which is based on pathophysiological considerations, seems to be a promising alternative for neuroprotection in cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
