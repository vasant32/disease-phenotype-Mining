<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Platelet aggregation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> are key events leading to microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and progressive impairment of downstream microvascular perfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of platelet function with a GP IIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> would increase the efficacy and safety and increase the time window for thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with full- and half-dose tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, rats were treated with 7E3 F(ab')2 (6 mg/kg) in combination with tPA at doses of 10 and 5 mg/kg, tPA alone at a dose of 10 or 5 mg/kg, 7E3 F(ab')2 (6 mg/kg) alone, or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 and tPA (full- or half-dose) significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 or tPA (full- or half-dose) alone did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements of cerebral microvessels perfused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> revealed that combination treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 and full-dose tPA significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the percentage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-perfused vessels compared with saline and full-dose tPA-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 in combination with full-dose tPA significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased microvascular platelet accumulation and matrix metalloproteinase 9 immunoreactivity and protected against loss of collagen IV immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 with full- and half-dose tPA at 4 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improves neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of patency and integrity of cerebral microvessels most likely contributes to the benefits observed with this combination therapy </plain></SENT>
