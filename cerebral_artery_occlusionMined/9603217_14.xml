<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation is triggered during reperfusion, the cytotoxic oxidant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> could be formed, but it is not known if this occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dot blot and immunohistochemistry studies were performed on the magnitude and time course of tyrosine nitration and inducible NO synthase (NOS2) in the postischemic rat pup brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by permanent left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in association with 1-h occlusion of the left common carotid artery in 7-day-old Wistar pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitrotyrosine (NT) immunoreactivity was evident in the blood vessels close to the cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 48-72 h of recovery, and T lymphocytes were involved with this production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NOS2 immunoreactivity was seen in neutrophils in the same vessels and in the parenchyma at 72 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas NT staining decreased with time, NOS2-positive neutrophils could be still detected in arachnoid vessels at 14 days of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that perivascular reactions mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> are important in the cascade of events that lead to brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NO-related species may serve as a signaling function instead of directly mediating toxicity </plain></SENT>
