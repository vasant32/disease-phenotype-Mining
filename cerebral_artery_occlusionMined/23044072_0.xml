<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the neurogenic and therapeutic potentials of human neural stem cells (NSCs) overexpressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (HB1.F3.BDNF) following transplantation into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F3.BDNF human NSCs (F3.BDNF) were transplanted into the contra-lateral side of striatum at 7 days after MCAo, and the transplanted animals were monitored up to 8 weeks using animal MRI and various behavioral tests before they were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, animal MRI results indicate that the majority of contra-laterally transplanted neural stem cells were migrated to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, showing a patho-tropism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplanted animals exhibited significant behavioral improvements in stepping, rotarod and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the transplanted human cells were co-localized with Nestin, DCX, MAP2, DARPP-32, TH, GAD65/67-positive cells, of which results can be correlated with neural regeneration and behavioral recovery in the transplanted animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we were able to detect high levels of human BDNF protein expression, presumably derived from the transplanted F3.BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that human neural stem cells (F3.BDNF) are effective in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animal models </plain></SENT>
