<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aprotinin, a nonspecific serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, has been used to decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and reduce the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have variably linked aprotinin administration with both improved as well as adverse cerebral consequences after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed this study to determine whether an antiinflammatory dose of aprotinin could improve the histologic and functional neurologic outcome in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After surgical preparation, the animals were randomized into 2 groups: an aprotinin group (60,000 kIU/kg IV) and a control group (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normothermic CPB was performed for 60 minutes during which time a partial overlapping 60 minutes of right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10) were measured at baseline, the end of CPB, then 2 and 24 hours after CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 3, the animals underwent functional neurologic testing and histologic assessment of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a reduction in systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the aprotinin group compared with the control group, demonstrated by lower levels of IL-1beta (P = 0.035) and IL-6 (P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aprotinin group also had a better functional neurologic performance (median [interquartile range]: aprotinin 27 [8] vs control 32 [6]; P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (aprotinin 306 [27] mm(3) vs control 297 [52] mm(3); P = 0.599) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring during CPB, aprotinin decreased the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there was no difference in the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, there was a small improvement in the short-term functional neurologic outcome in the aprotinin group </plain></SENT>
