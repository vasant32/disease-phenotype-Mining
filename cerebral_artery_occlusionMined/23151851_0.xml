<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI), an arterial input function (AIF) is usually obtained from a time-concentration curve (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>) of the cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at developing an alternative technique for reconstructing AIF from <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCCs</z:chebi> of multiple brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIF was formulated by a multi-exponential function using four parameters, and the parameters were determined so that the AIF curves convolved with a model of tissue response reproduced the measured <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCCs</z:chebi> for 20 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systematic simulations were performed to evaluate the effects of possible error sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSC-MRI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) studies were performed on 14 patients with major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) images were calculated from DSC-MRI data, using our novel method alongside conventional AIF estimations, and compared with those from (15)O-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulations showed that the calculated CBF values were sensitive to variations in the assumptions regarding cerebral blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, AIFs were reasonably reconstructed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in CBF values between DSC-MRI and PET was -2.2 ± 7.4 ml/100 g/min (r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.01) for our method, versus -0.2 ± 8.2 ml/100 g/min (r = 0.47, p = 0.01) for the conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in the ratio of affected to unaffected hemispheres between DSC-MRI and PET was 0.07 ± 0.09 (r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.01) for our method, versus 0.07 ± 0.09 (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.01) for the conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The contrasts in CBF images from our method were the same as those from the conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the feasibility of assessing CBF without arterial blood signals </plain></SENT>
