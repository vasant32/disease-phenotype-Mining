<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As assessed at 1 week after 30 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the order of vulnerability was projection neurons &gt; parvalbumin-expressing interneurons &gt; nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase-containing interneurons &gt; cholinergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the ischemic lesion, projection neurons were almost completely lost whereas cholinergic interneurons were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calretinin-immunoreactive interneurons also seemed resistant to the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of p75(NTR) was induced in cholinergic interneurons within the lesioned area, raising the possibility of a protective action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the number of cholinergic interneurons was unaffected in p75(NTR) knockout mice subjected to the same ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These quantitative data demonstrate that striatal neurons in the mouse are differentially susceptible to ischemic damage and argue against a significant role of p75(NTR) for the high resistance of cholinergic interneurons </plain></SENT>
