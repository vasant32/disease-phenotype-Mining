<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seven days after unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats, peripheral type <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> binding sites (PTBBS), using [3H]PK 11195 as a specific radioligand, were greatly increased in the cortical and striatal regions surrounding the focus of infarction with smaller increases in the ventrolateral and posterior thalamic complexes and in the substantia nigra, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, PTBBS increases were observed in the caudate nucleus and entorhinal cortex of cats likewise subjected to prior unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intrastriatal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (250 nmol) in the rat resulted in a dramatic ipsilateral increase in PTBBS levels in the striatum and in the deeper laminae of the ipsilateral frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intrastriatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> administration (12 nmol) also elicited PTBBS increases ipsilaterally in rat striatum and cortex; a bilateral elevation of PTBBS levels was observed in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these interventions there existed a good spatial correlation between the PTBBS increase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> as assessed either histologically or by the autoradiographic detection of the putative neuronal marker [3H]SCH 23390 (a D1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptor ligand) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a glial proliferation of non-neuronal cells (macrophage and glial cells) was observed in brain regions noted to have increased PTBBS levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PTBBS autoradiography thus constitutes a suitable technique for the localization of damaged areas in several experimental models of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTBBS label not only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> but also functionally related areas and could further our understanding of phenomena such as partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of PTBBS could be envisaged for the detection, localization and quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neuropathological situations which engender a glial reaction or macrophage invasion and is potentially applicable to both experimental and human subjects, in which both autoradiographic and tomographic approaches could be undertaken </plain></SENT>
