<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TIPE2 is a very recently identified negative regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that maintains immune homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether TIPE2 is expressed in the brain and contributes to the regulation of cerebral diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the potential roles of TIPE2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TIPE2(-/-) mice were used to assess whether TIPE2 provides neuroprotection following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and in vitro primary cerebral cell cultures were used to investigate the expression and regulation of TIPE2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that genetic ablation of the Tipe2 gene significantly increased the cerebral volume of infarction and neurological dysfunction in mice subjected to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis revealed more infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the ischemic hemisphere of TIPE2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The responses to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly increased in TIPE2(-/-) mouse brain after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further observed that TIPE2 was highly induced in WT mice after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and was expressed mainly in microglia/macrophages, but not in neurons and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that regulation of TIPE2 expression was associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that TIPE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and suggest that TIPE2 plays an essential role in a signal transduction pathway that links the inflammatory immune response to specific conditions after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Targeting TIPE2 may be a new therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
