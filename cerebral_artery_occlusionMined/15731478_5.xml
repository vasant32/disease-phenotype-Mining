<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to design a simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale that requires minimal training but reflects initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and is predictive of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale assessed 3 parameters: (1) level of consciousness, (2) gaze, and (3) motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each item was graded 0 to 2, where 0 indicated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings and 2 severe abnormalities (ie, profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> or worse, forced gaze deviation, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a study period of 11 months, patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt; or =6 hours) were examined by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist assessing the new scale as well as the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 83 patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> magnetic resonance angiography (MRA; as part of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale was strongly associated with the NIHSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver reliability of the new scale was high (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.947) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using post hoc analysis, a score of &gt; or =4 predicted proximal vessel occlusion (T-segment or M1-segment occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on MRA) almost as accurately (overall accuracy 0.86) as an NIHSS score of &gt;or =14 (overall accuracy 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale reflects <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity well and predicts proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with reasonable accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical scale needs further evaluation before it can be recommended as a tool for the triage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
