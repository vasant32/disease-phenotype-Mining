<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg/h) post-conditioning provided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (up to 24 h) neuroprotection in rats with transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extend these data by examining long-term protection and exploring underlying mechanisms involving AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit internalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg/h after 60 min of occlusion (beginning of reperfusion for 4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> post-conditioning reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved spatial memory deficiencies (up to 28 days) induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> post-conditioning promoted neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine and neuron-specific nuclear protein immunofluorescence-double staining at day 28 after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> post-conditioning increased the surface expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit, thus inhibited the internalization of this part until 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> post-conditioning provides long-term protection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit internalization may contributed to this long-term neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
