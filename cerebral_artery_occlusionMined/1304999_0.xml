<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the sham-operated rats, both SOD and GSH-Px activity in the ischemic area (striatum and fronto-parietal cortex) were significantly reduced by 30 min. of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, GSH-Px activity in the peri-ischemic area (parieto-parasagittal) was significantly reduced as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that in the striatum the GSH-Px activity was much higher than that in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to our data, it was suggested that in the ischemic condition, cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">Hydrogen Peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>) were accumulated, and thus the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> in the neuronal membrane were trapped by these free radical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And such a process resulted in neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It implicated that the oxygen free radical might be involved in the neuronal damage induced by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi>, since the <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> were excessively generated during the oxidative deamination of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> and the free radical scavengers, SOD and GSH-Px were decreased concomitantly in the cerebral ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
