<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombolysis is the only approved therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is a severe complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are believed to increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, thrombolysis is usually contraindicated in patients on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether thrombolysis in a thromboembolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats pretreated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> increases secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and whether substitution of coagulation factors before thrombolysis prevents hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats were anticoagulated using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in drinking water (0.4 mg/kg per 24 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strength of anticoagulation was monitored using benchside international normalized ratio (INR) coagulometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (9 mg/kg) was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of 5 groups of animals received prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC, 50 U/kg) 15 minutes before thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed 20 minutes, 2.5 hours, and 24 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was quantified on T2* magnetic resonance images as previously established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severity of hypoperfusion on initial perfusion-weighted imaging -magnetic resonance did not differ among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis resulted in successful reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulated animals had significantly more secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and a higher mortality rate compared with nonanticoagulated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PCC rapidly reversed the increased international normalized ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although PCC failed to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the strongly anticoagulated, it reduced the incidence of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in moderately anticoagulated rats (INR, 2-3) to the level of nonanticoagulated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preceding anticoagulation increases risk and extent of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reversal of moderate anticoagulation using PCC may allow thrombolytic therapy without increasing the risk of secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
