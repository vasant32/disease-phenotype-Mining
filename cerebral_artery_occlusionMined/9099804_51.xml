<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats causes overexpression of interleukin-1, and that administration of the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> protein (IL-1ra) reduces ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to determine whether a recombinant adenovirus vector carrying human interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> cDNA (Ad.RSVIL-1ra) could be used to overexpress IL-1ra in mouse brain and to evaluate its effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation and infarction after permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ad.RSVIL-1ra, control adenovirus containing the lacZ gene (Ad.RSVlacZ), or saline was injected into the right cerebral ventricle in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain IL-1ra concentrations were measured 1 to 13 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the fifth day after virus injection, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain water content was determined and a histological technique was used to measure the infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of human IL-1ra protein in whole brain was confirmed by immunoassay in the Ad.RSVIL-1ra injected mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It began on the first day, peaked at 5-7 days, and was sustained for 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were significantly reduced following 24 h of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice transfected with Ad.RSVIL-1ra compared to Ad.RSVlacZ or saline 5 days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that adenoviral vectors can be used to deliver genes to small animals such as mice and also suggest the feasibility of gene therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of human IL-1ra attenuated ischemic brain injury, suggesting that IL-1 may play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
