<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rats were divided into five groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, model control group, sham group and two LP groups (fed with 5 mg/kg bw or 20 mg/kg bw of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> daily for 15 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury was established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The score of neurological behavior was evaluated at the 3rd and 24th hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were put to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activities of iNOS, SOD, CAT and the contents of NO and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in brain and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Bcl-2 mRNA and HIF-1alphamRNA in cortex were examined by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with the model group, the neurological deficits were milder, the volumes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were smaller, the activities of SOD, CAT in brain tissue were higher, the activities of iNOS as well as the contents of NO, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in brain tissue and serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> were lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">Lycopene</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the model group and control group, the expression of HIF-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of cortex in the high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg bw) group was up-regulated; while the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA of cortex was up-regulated only in the low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg bw) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were some protective effects of oral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injuries induced by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanism may be related with increasing activities of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, inhibiting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, decreasing activities of iNOS,and up-regulating the expression of HIF-1alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as Bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
