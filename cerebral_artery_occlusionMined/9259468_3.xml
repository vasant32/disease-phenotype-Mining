<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This methodology has been now applied to ex vivo preparations (brain slices) in order to study diverse neurotransmitter activities in various brain regions ipsilateral and controlateral to a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion performed in anaesthetised adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data demonstrated that significant changes of voltammetric <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> levels related to the ischaemic state were monitored within the ipsilateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion frontal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus which were the brain area studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it appeared that voltammetric catecholaminergic and 5-hydroxy indolaminergic values measured within the nucleus accumbens controlateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion differ significantly from the results monitored with the same technique in brain slices obtained from sham rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In various studies, the brain regions contralateral to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion are generally considered as control areas, however, the present data suggest that the nucleus accumbens contralateral to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion side is specifically affected by the ischaemic state </plain></SENT>
