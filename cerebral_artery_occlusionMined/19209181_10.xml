<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They expressed CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105, CD166 and nestin, but not CD34, CD45, CD106 SSEA-4 or Oct3/4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty million eMSCs in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the femoral veins of spontaneously hypertensive rats after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The migration and differentiation of the eMSCs in the ischemic brain were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that eMSCs migrated to the infarction region and differentiated into neurons, which were positive for beta-tubulin III, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), HuC, neurofilament and human nuclear antibody, and to vascular endothelial cells, which were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transplanted cells survived in the infarction region for at least 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adhesive removal function significantly improved in the first week after cell transplantation, and rotarod motor function significantly improved starting from the second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume in the eMSC group was significantly smaller than that in the PBS control group at 4 weeks after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that when administered intravenously, eMSCs differentiated into neuronal and endothelial cells, reduced the infarction volume, and improved behavioral functional outcome significantly in transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
