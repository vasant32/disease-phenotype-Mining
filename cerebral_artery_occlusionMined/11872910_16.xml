<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The spontaneously hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rat (SHRSP) is an animal model for a complex form of cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI provides an efficient and noninvasive tool for studying the time course of brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to gain new insights into the pathological phenomena responsible for the occurrence of brain injury in SHRSP with the use of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), one of the most efficient MRI parameters for detecting brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, the pattern of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> variation observed in SHRSP was compared with that of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced in both SHRSP and Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups of animals were studied: SHRSP developing spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> fed with a salt-loaded (n=15, group 1) or standard diet (n=3, group 2) and Sprague-Dawley rats (n=8, group 3) and SHRSP (n=8, group 4) with permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps and T2-weighted images of brains were performed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the rats were killed, the brains were removed and histologically processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no decrease in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> during spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the SHRSP fed with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or salt-enriched diet, while both the SHRSP and Sprague-Dawley rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showed a marked decrease that lasted for 24 to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> cannot be considered a major factor in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in SHRSP, which show only vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after the beginning of the damage with no evidence of metabolic impairment </plain></SENT>
