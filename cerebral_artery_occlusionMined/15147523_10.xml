<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, induction of TG-2 was studied in rats following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alterations in 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining revealed maximum infarction 3 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcript levels by real-time PCR analysis showed both forms of TG-2 mRNA peaking on day 5 after injury in ipsilateral cortex, with greater induction of the full-length TG-2 (TG-L) transcript than the truncated form of the TG-2 (TG-S) transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the ipsilateral hippocampus, peak induction of both forms of TG-2 mRNA peaked 1 day after injury and to a lesser extent than observed in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that TG-L protein expression progressively increased from 1 to 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with greater expression in cortex than hippocampus (525 +/- 10% vs. 196 +/- 8% of control, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, expression of TG-S was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that increased TG-2 mRNA and protein expression occurs in a delayed fashion following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of TG-2 induction after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was similar to that observed after traumatic brain injury (previously described), suggesting a similar role of TG-2 in both pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
