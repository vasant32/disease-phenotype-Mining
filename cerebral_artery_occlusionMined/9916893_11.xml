<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel rat chemokine, termed ST38, was identified through its upregulation in ischemic brain tissue using a biased differential display technique targeting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> with regulatory AUUUA-motifs typically found in transcripts of cytokine and immediate early genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ST38 transcripts were transiently induced in ischemic cortex between 4 and 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ST38 is a member of the CC chemokine family, closely related to human Exodus-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene of the mouse ST38 homologue was mapped to the central region of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In experimental autoimmune panencephalomyelitis ST38 expression correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and was significantly reduced by TNF-neutralization in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory stimuli induce ST38 transcription in astrocyte, microglia and macrophage cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a role of ST38 in the control of neuroinflammatory tissue responses </plain></SENT>
