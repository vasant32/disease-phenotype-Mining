<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early noncontrast computed tomographic scans may visualize a hyperdense middle cerebral artery before the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> becomes visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sign disappears within a few days, corresponds to the clot itself, and might be associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine its prevalence, diagnostic value, relationship to demographic data, ability to separate embolic from nonembolic causes, short-term prognostic value, evolution over time, and relationship to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed this study using computed tomographic scans performed within 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 272 consecutive unselected patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three subjects had the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign, leading to a prevalence of 26.8% in the whole group and 41.2% in patients with a middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 100%, but sensitivity was only 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This sign was not dependent on cerebrovascular risk factors, but was more likely to occur in cortical and in large, deep, middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It provided only a 3.5% gain in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and one fifth of patients with the sign recovered within 2 weeks; this sign was not an independent variable of poor outcome on multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It spontaneously disappeared within a few days and was always related to an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in patients who underwent early angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign is useful in the diagnosis of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but does not always predict a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
