<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug with a promising preclinical profile involving both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> and antiepileptogenic effects in kindling models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter stimulated the present study to compare its neuroprotective properties with the potent and selective, non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801, in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after a transient occlusion of 90 minutes the animals were sacrificed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and lesion distribution were determined from stained coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LEV was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus injections of 5.5, 11, 22 and 44 mg x kg(-1), 30 minutes before occlusion followed by a continuous 24 hour i.p. infusion of 1.25, 2.6, 5.1 and 10.2 mg x kg(-1) per hour, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LEV administration did not alter body temperature but reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 33% (P&lt; 0.05) at the highest dose tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An i.p. bolus injection of 0.04, 0.12 and 0.4 mg x kg(-1) of MK-801 followed by continuous i.p. infusion of 0.036, 0.108 and 0.36 mg x kg(-1) per hour, reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 49, 51 and 74% (P&lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only the highest dose of MK-801 induced a significant reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt; 0.05) and this was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LEV possesses neuroprotective properties which may be relevant for its antiepileptogenic action </plain></SENT>
