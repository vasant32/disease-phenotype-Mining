<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: cDNA microarray chips containing 512 cDNAs were made by Biostar Genechip Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with an filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Saline or BYHWT was given p.o. after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and brains were removed after 24 h of recirculation for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A differential measurment of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> from post-ischemic and BYHWT treated animals was performed with microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Up-and down-regulated genes were 69 and 80 in ischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Up-and down-regulated genes were 25 and 6 in BYHWT treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BYHWT regulates the differential expression genes after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in rats, due to its mechanism of protecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
