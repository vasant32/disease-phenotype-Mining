<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have showed that ginsenoside (GS)-Rd, a mono-compound isolated from traditional Chinese herb panax ginseng, has the neuroprotective effects following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our latest study showed that GS-Rd could block calcium influx in cultured cortical neurons after excitotoxic injury, indicating that GS-Rd may act on <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore this possibility, in this study, we used a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model to examine the effects of GS-Rd on the expression of non-selective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels, including transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) and acid sensing ion channels (ASIC), and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptors, which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> play essential roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that both TRPM and ASIC channels were expressed in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h following MCAO insult, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of TRPM7, ASIC1a and ASIC2a were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of 10 mg/kg GS-Rd attenuated MCAO-induced expression of TRPM7 and ASIC1a but promoted that of ASIC2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GS-Rd had no significant effects on the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that GS-Rd neuroprotection following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be at least due to its effects on the expression of TRPM7, ASIC1a and ASIC2a </plain></SENT>
