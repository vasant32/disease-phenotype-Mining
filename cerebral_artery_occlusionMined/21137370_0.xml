<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 96 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into four groups (n = 24): control group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) model group, low dose TSG (60 mg/kg) group and high dose TSG (120 mg/kg) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 6 days' administration of TSG or natural saline (model group), reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model was established by intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in control group were operated while middle cerebral artery were not blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 6, 24, 48 h and 7 d after reperfusion, behavior test was used to evaluate the neurological deficiency of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of NGF and GAP-43 in the cortex were measured by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with model group, both dose of TSG could decrease the grade of the rat neurological defects except at 6 h of ter reperfusion and increase the protein expressions of NGF and GAP-43 after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TSG can improve the neurological function through increasing the expressions of NGF and GAP-43 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion rats </plain></SENT>
