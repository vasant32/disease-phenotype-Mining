<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient occlusion of right middle cerebral artery in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 35) was induced with an intraluminal filament followed by three training conditions, 1. motor skill training on Rota-rod requiring balance and coordination skills, 2. simple exercise on treadmill, and 3. nontrained controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synaptic plasticity in brain was evaluated by synapotophysin immunocytochemistry at 14 or 28 days after training procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined in Nissl stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both at 14 and 28 days after Rota-rod training, intense synaptophysin immunoreactivity was present in the right but not the left mediodorsal and ventromedial nuclei of thalamus of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In treadmill-trained animals, however, similarly intense synaptic plasticity in these two thalamic nuclei was seen only at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was found also in other brain regions adjacent to or remote from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that motor training, particularly motor skill training involving balance and coordination, facilitates a uniquely lateralized synaptogenesis in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
