<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the intraluminal suture occlusion model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either permanent MCAO (Group A, n = 6), reperfusion after 1 h (Group B, n = 5), or reperfusion after 3 h (Group C, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI and Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> enhanced T1-weighted images were performed at six time points from 0.5 to 6 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume increased progressively in group A, decreased significantly in group B (P&lt;0.01), and only showed a tendency toward reduction in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted MRI delineated severe perfusion deficits in the ischemic core, confirmed early and late reperfusion, and was able to demonstrate postischemic hyperperfusion in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> extravasation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals with permanent MCAO and initially became grossly visible between 4.5 and 6 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While only 2 animals demonstrated contrast enhancement in group B, widespread <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> changes were detected immediately following late reperfusion (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that with advanced MRI techniques, alterations of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> can be correlated with the hemodynamic and biophysical consequences of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
