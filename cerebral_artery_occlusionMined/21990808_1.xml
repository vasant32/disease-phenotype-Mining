<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed to estimate with more precision the effect of IAT on several key clinical endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized trials of IAT in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified by PUBMED search and by hand search of potentially relevant references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trial methodologies were assessed for compatibility in study protocols and statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed evaluating the effect of IAT on functional outcome at 90 days and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SICH) within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three trials met the criteria for the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IAT treated patients were significantly more likely to have a modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤ 1 (31% vs 20%, OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4, p=0.01); mRS ≤ 2 (43% vs 31%, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0, p=0.01); and NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 0 or 1 (23% vs 12%, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4, p=0.007) at the 90 day follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on mortality at 90 days (20% vs 19%, OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of SICH was significantly increased in the active treatment arms (11% vs 2%, OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 16, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> standard functional endpoints for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials were substantially improved in the active treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite an increased risk of SICH, there was no effect on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion with intra-arterial thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
