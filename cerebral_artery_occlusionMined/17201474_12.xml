<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The assessment of both histological and functional long-term outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is increasingly recommended for preclinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas correlations between behavioral impairments and primary ischemic lesion are documented, little is known about their relationships with remote nonischemic regions that undergo secondary degeneration, such as the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized rats were subjected to mild (30 min) or severe (60 min) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, sensorimotor behavior was assessed according to the neurological score, limb-placing, adhesive-removal, and staircase tests; the final histological lesion was measured after this assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical damage was correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transient and long-lasting sensorimotor deficits, whereas striatal lesion was more consistently reflected by the forelimb-placing reflexes and adhesive-removal motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was not correlated to early neurological impairment, but rather to the late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> at the adhesive-removal test and to the skilled forepaw reaching alteration at the staircase test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that thalamus contributes, albeit moderately, to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced long-lasting sensorimotor deficits, some of which represent relevant targets for therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
