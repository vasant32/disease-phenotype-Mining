<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied an alternative drug delivery strategy, by injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> phosphate-containing liposomes in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, and tested the hypothesis that this approach improves behavioral recovery and reduces lesion growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with a blood clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 h, animals were intravenously injected with rtPA plus empty long-circulating liposomes (LCL), free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> phosphate (DXP), or DXP-containing LCL (LCL-DXP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated with different behavioral tests up to 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion development was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging of tissue and perfusion parameters from 0-2 h until 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of brain inflammatory markers was measured with RT-PCR at post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rtPA plus LCL-DXP resulted in significantly improved behavioral outcome as compared to treatment with rtPA plus empty LCL or free DXP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and final brain lesion sizes were comparable between treatment groups; however a predictive algorithm revealed a significantly larger salvaged tissue area after treatment with LCL-DXP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> phosphate via LCL in combination with rtPA-induced thrombolysis can significantly improve outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging-based predictive algorithms provide a sensitive means to measure treatment effects on lesion development </plain></SENT>
