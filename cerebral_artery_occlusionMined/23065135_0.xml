<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both assays, migration of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> moiety produced no significant differences, but removal of the group increased potency of the compound for inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chloro and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi> substitution of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> moiety in the meta and para positions increased potency by ≤160%, but fluoro substitutions had no effect </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microglial migration assays also showed that p-BrDPhG is more potent than o-DTG in this marker for microglial activation, which is also linked to neuronal injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
