<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were subjected to 2 h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and treated with or without Niaspan alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> alone and combination Niaspan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> starting 24 h after MCAo and daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Axonal damage and density were evaluated by Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nogo66 Receptor (NgR) expression and immunoreactive microglia (Iba-1) were also measured in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Niaspan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> monotherapy and combination treatment significantly promote functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) compared to MCAo control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment with Niaspan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> induces additive but not synergetic effects when compared to Niaspan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> monotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment significantly decreased APP expression and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1389790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bielschowsky</z:e> silver expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NGR and Iba-1 expression were significantly decreased in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that treatment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with combination of Niaspan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly improves functional outcome, reduces axonal damage and increases axonal density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of the NGR and reduced activated microglia may contribute to functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
