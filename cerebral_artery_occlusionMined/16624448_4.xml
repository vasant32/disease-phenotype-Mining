<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic window for B(2) receptor inhibition determining its potential clinical use has not been investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the effect of delayed B(2) receptor inhibition on morphological and functional outcome following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) by an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> or 1.0mg/kg/day Anatibant (LF 16-0687 Ms), a selective bradykinin B(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for 3 days beginning at different time points after MCAo: 1, 2.5, 4.5, or 6.5h (n=10 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological recovery was examined daily, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on day 7 after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> was not influenced by B(2) receptor inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement of functional outcome was observed when treatment was delayed up to 4.5h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.05 versus vehicle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of B(2) receptors during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, i.e. when the inhibitor was given 1h after MCAo, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the basal ganglia and in the cortex by 49% (p&lt;0.05) and 26% (p&lt;0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of B(2) receptors at later time points (2.5, 4.5, or 6.5 after MCAo) reduced penumbral damage, i.e. cortical infarction, by 19-26% (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the current study shows that the therapeutic window of B(2) receptor inhibition extends for up to 6.5h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data therefore suggest that inhibition of kinin B(2) receptors represents a treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> which may warrant clinical validation </plain></SENT>
