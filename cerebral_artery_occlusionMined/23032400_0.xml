<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, neurobehavioral scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of rats were evaluated after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in ovariectomized rats (Ovx-2), Sham-operated rats (Sham-2), ovariectomized female rats administered 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (Estr-2), and ovariectomized rats administered both 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and stereotactic injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (Estr+G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the Kir6.2 and SUR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in the brain cortices of female ovariectomized rats were lower than those in Sham rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the expression levels of Kir6.2 and SUR1 in brain cortices of ovariectomized rats recovered after supplementation with 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> were abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, a K(ATP) channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> significantly upregulates the expression of K(ATP) channel subunits and channel activity in the brain cortices of ovariectomized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This regulation is associated with the neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
