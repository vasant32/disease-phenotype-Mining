<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain osmolality was determined with a vapor pressure osmometer, brain water content by wet-dry weight, and tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> contents by flame photometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was tested by Evans blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made from the ischemic cortex within 14 days of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain osmolality increased from 311 +/- 2 to 329 +/- 2 mOsm/kg by 6 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum osmolality did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The osmotic gradient between blood and brain peaked at approximately 26 mOsm/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain osmolality then decreased to 310 +/- 2 mOsm/kg by 12 h after occlusion and remained at about that same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Water content increased progressively within 1 day of occlusion, then gradually decreased by 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> content did not increase within 6 h of occlusion, and Evans blue extravasation was not seen within that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that an osmotic pressure gradient contributes to the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> only during the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in brain osmolality is not related to tissue electrolyte change or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption to protein </plain></SENT>
