<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study reports a repeated longitudinal imaging for cellular-scale changes of neuro-glia-vascular unit at the boundary of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mouse cerebral cortex in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy was used to trace the longitudinal changes of cortical microvasculature and astroglia following permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52274">sulforhodamine 101</z:chebi> (SR101), a previously-known marker of astroglia, provide a bright signal in the vessels soon after the intraperitoneal injection, and that intensity was sufficient to detect the microvasculature up to a depth of 0.8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5-8 h from the injection of SR101, cortical astroglia was also imaged up to a depth of 0.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 day from MCAO, some microvessels showed a closure of the lumen space in the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, leading to a restructuring of microvascular networks up to 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the regions of the distorted microvasculature, an increase in the number of cells labeled with SR101 was detected, which was found as due to labeled neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical results further showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> provokes neuronal uptake of SR101, which delineate a boundary between dying and surviving cells at the peripheral zone of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, reproducibility of the MCAO model was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a different animal group, which showed the consistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory over the subjects </plain></SENT>
