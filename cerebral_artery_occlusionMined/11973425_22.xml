<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Western blot technique was used to define the collagen type IV protein content in various brain regions, whereas immunohistochemistry identified microvascular basal lamina loss (anticollagen type IV staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of damage was quantified by automatic morphometric video-imaging analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was based on the Mann-Whitney test and the paired Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic hemisphere showed a reduction of the collagen type IV protein content after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in the Western blot (reduction compared with the nonischemic side: total hemisphere, 33% +/- 6%; basal ganglia, 25% +/- 7%; cortex 49% +/- 4%; P &lt; 0.01) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a decrease in the number of cerebral microvessels between the ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres (20% +/- 2%), cortical (8% +/- 3%), and basal ganglia areas (31% +/- 3%) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides a reduction of the vessel number, there was also a loss in basal lamina antigen-positive stained area in ischemic areas (hemisphere, 16% +/- 3%; cortex, 14% +/- 3%; basal ganglia, 21% +/- 4%; P &lt; 0.01) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical areas had a less pronounced basal lamina loss than basal ganglia (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the first time, microvascular basal lamina damage, indicated by collagen type IV loss, is proven in rats by biochemical and morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes are comparable with those found in nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors report novel data regarding microvascular ischemic changes in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide a basis for future experiments to determine the mechanisms of ischemic microvascular damage and to devise new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
