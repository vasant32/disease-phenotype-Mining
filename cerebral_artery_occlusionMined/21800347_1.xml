<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Maslinic acid (MA), a natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35191">triterpene</z:chebi> from Olea europaea L., is a well-known inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase and elicits multiple biological activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of MA on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult rats were made hyperglycemic by intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> and were given MA (50 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) intragastrically for 14 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion was then induced by a suture insertion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that diabetic rats pretreated with high-dose MA had lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, but both doses reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and improved neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> overflow was also observed in MA-treated rats after 2 hr of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 24 hr and 72 hr reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MA treatment enhanced the glial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter GLT-1 expression at the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the injection of dihydrokainate, a GLT-1 glutamate transporter inhibitor, reversed the effect of MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that suppression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake via nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation is an important contributory factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-triggered <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> excitotoxicity, and inhibition of NF-κB could prevent ischemic suppression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake and GLT-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed that MA pretreatment attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that, in addition to showing promising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> properties, MA has a direct beneficial effect in cerebral ischemic injury, which may be correlated with the promotion of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> clearance by NF-κB-mediated GLT-1 up-regulation </plain></SENT>
