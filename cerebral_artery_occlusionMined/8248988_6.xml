<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">Arachidonate</z:chebi> metabolites have been implicated in the development of cerebral injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particular importance has been placed on the balance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi> because of its regulative activity on platelet functions and arterial tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> in postischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the effects of S-1452, a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas, and survival rate in rats with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model was produced by inserting a piece of silicon-coated nylon thread into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratio of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> to 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> significantly rose at 0 hour (P &lt; .05), 1 hour (P &lt; .01), 3 hours (P &lt; .05), and 12 hours (P &lt; .05) and then nearly returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 24 hours after reperfusion following 1-hour occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with S-1452 (5, 10, or 50 mg/kg PO) significantly attenuated the increase in postischemic water content in the cerebral cortex perfused by the anterior cerebral artery and the cerebral cortex perfused by the middle cerebral artery in a dose-dependent manner but slightly attenuated it in the caudate putamen 24 hours after reperfusion following 1-hour occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with S-1452 (10 mg/kg PO) also significantly decreased the areas of infarction in the front parts of the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of animals after 2 hours of occlusion tended to be improved by treatment with S-1452 (10 mg.kg-1.d-1 PO), although there was no statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> is closely related to postischemic brain injury in the early phase of recirculation and that S-1452 may have a protective effect on postischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
