<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a rare complication of basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, and, to our knowledge, this complication has not been previously described in otherwise healthy patients with unruptured basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old woman was found to have an unruptured 1.6 x 1.0-cm basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, as revealed by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She elected to undergo surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Transsylvian dissection, exposure, and uneventful clipping of the basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring after the repair of an intact basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has several possible causes, including retraction injury and direct surgical injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Awareness of this complication is important for the early recognition and management of the occlusion before infarction is established </plain></SENT>
