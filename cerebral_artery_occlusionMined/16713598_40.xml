<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective mechanism of human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) in the rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the inflammatory sequelae that occur following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we investigated whether HUCBC protection could be derived from the modulation of this immuno-inflammatory event, suggested by the attraction of the HUCBC to the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that, following MCAO, rat spleen size was reduced concomitantly with their CD8+ T-cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, MCAO-induced spleen size reduction correlated with the extent of ischemic damage, however, HUCBC treatment rescued the spleen weight, splenic CD8+ T-cell counts, as well as the amount of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, splenocyte proliferation assays demonstrated that HUCBC treatment opposed MCAO-associated T-cell proliferation by increasing the production of IL-10 while decreasing IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest a novel immunomodulatory mechanism by which HUCBC mediate protection in the rat MCAO model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
