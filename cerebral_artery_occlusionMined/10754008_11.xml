<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously showed that the intravenous administration of the potent final sigma(1)-receptor ligand 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1-(4-phenylbutyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidine</z:chebi> (PPBP) provides neuroprotection against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that the protection depends on treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that PPBP would provide neuroprotection in a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 7 days of reperfusion in the rat as assessed with neurobehavioral outcome and infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under the controlled conditions of normoxia, normocarbia, and normothermia, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with the intraluminal suture occlusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used laser Doppler flowmetry to assess MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 60 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a blinded fashion and received a continuous intravenous infusion of control saline or 0.1, 1, or 10 micromol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>h(-1) PPBP for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral evaluation was performed at baseline (3 to 4 days before MCAO) and at 3 and 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was assessed with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining on day 7 of reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-determined infarction volume of ipsilateral cortex was smaller in rats treated with 10 micromol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>h(-1) PPBP (n=15, 68+/-12 mm(3), 18+/-3% of contralateral structure, P&lt;0.05) (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) compared with corresponding rats treated with saline (n=15, 114+/-11 mm(3), 31+/-3% of contralateral structure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PPBP did not provide significant neuroprotection in the caudoputamen complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although MCAO was associated with several alterations in behavior, the treatment with PPBP had no effect on behavioral outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that the potent final sigma(1)-receptor ligand PPBP decreases cortical infarction volume without altering neurobehavior after transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and prolonged reperfusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
