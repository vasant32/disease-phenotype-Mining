<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A well known example of this remote effect is so called diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> in this phenomenon, amino acid <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> were measured in rat basal ganglia after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model, blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism have been reported to increase in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and globus pallidus in the postischemia period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were reduced in ipsilateral substantia nigra and globus pallidus from the 3rd day on, with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level showing no significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral substantia nigra, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> increased significantly from the 1st day through the 28th day, whereas <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> showed no significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same, although less pronounced, tendency was observed in the contralateral globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contralateral striatum, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> increased only during the 1st week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results may be interpreted as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> were reduced in ipsilateral substantia nigra and globus pallidus due to the afferent pathway interruption caused by focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction of inhibitory <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> probably set neurons in these nuclei in a relatively activated state, resulting in the elevation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increment of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in contralateral substantia nigra and globus pallidus can be attributed to a compensation for the reduction inn ipsilateral nuclei, because the increment was observed even in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This hitherto unknown phenomenon will raise an interesting problem as to the plasticity of the damaged brain </plain></SENT>
