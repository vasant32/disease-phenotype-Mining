<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several clinical studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> acts as a potent growth and protective factor in the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal women experience permanent hypoestrogenicity and suffer from increased risk of brain injury associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy appears to decrease the risk and severity of these neurodegenerative conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies using animal models have shown that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> exerts similar effects in rodents and can enhance cell survival and induce synaptic plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we undertook studies to assess whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment can decrease brain injury and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by an experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and whether aging animals remain responsive to the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We will review results from recent studies that demonstrate that 1) in young animals, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> exert profound protective effects against ischemic brain injury induced by cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 2) the response of aging animals has been tested with varying results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We will discuss and compare our experimental findings that utilize a permanent cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model and physiological levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> replacement therapy in young and middle-aged rats with those of previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations provide important insights into the potential protective actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy on age- and disease-related processes in the brain </plain></SENT>
