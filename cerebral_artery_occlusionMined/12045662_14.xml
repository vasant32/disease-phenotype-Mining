<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> induced by three different intensities of photochemical damage, a method that was newly introduced in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both WT and KO mice, the intensity-dependent increase of FCII size was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FCII size in tPA WT mice was smaller than in KO mice in cases of mild damage, whereas the FCII size was larger in WT mice than in KO mice in cases of severe damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in FCII size between WT and KO mice in cases of moderate damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of microthrombi also increased with damage intensity in both WT and KO mice, but was less in WT mice at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intensities of damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results support the validity of the model of thrombotic occlusion by photochemical damage in mice, and suggest that endogenous tPA protects FCII through thrombolytic action on transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery with mild damage, but deteriorates on persistent occlusion with severe damage </plain></SENT>
