<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor to the infarction site has also been demonstrated to be neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that brain-derived neurotrophic factor contributes to the therapeutic benefits of mesenchymal stem cell delivery, we compared the efficacy of systemic delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells transfected with a fiber-mutant F/RGD adenovirus vector with a brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (brain-derived neurotrophic factor-human mesenchymal stem cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced by intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with a microfilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human mesenchymal stem cells and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-human mesenchymal stem cells were i.v. injected into the rats 6 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was assessed at 6 h, 1, 3 and 7 days using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed using the treadmill stress test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both human mesenchymal stem cells and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-human mesenchymal stem cells reduced lesion volume and elicited functional improvement compared with the control sham group, but the effect was greater in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-human mesenchymal stem cell group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ELISA analysis of the infarcted hemisphere revealed an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the human mesenchymal stem cell groups, but a greater increase in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-human mesenchymal stem cell group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that brain-derived neurotrophic factor contributes to neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and cellular delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor can be achieved by i.v. delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells </plain></SENT>
