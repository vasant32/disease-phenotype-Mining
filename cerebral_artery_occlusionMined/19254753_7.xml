<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> and synthesized by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D(2) synthases (PGDS) via the cyclooxygenase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two distinct types of PGDS have been identified: hematopoietic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D synthase (H-PGDS) and lipocalin-type <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> D synthase (L-PGDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because relatively little is known about the role of L-PGDS in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, here we examined the outcomes in L-PGDS knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice after two different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> models, transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (tMCAO) and permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the tMCAO model, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded with a monofilament for 90 min and then reperfused for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pMCAO model, the distal part of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was permanently occluded and the mice were sacrificed after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percent corrected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological score were determined after 4 and 7 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>L-PGDS knockout mice had significantly greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> than did WT mice after tMCAO (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, L-PGDS knockout mice showed greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and neurological deficits as compared to their WT counterparts after pMCAO (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the two models enabled us to study the role of L-PGDS in both early (tMCAO) and delayed (pMCAO) ischemic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that L-PGDS is beneficial for protecting the brain against transient and permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results provide a better understanding of the role played by the enzymes that control eicosanoid synthesis and how they can be utilized as potential targets to prevent damage following either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or potentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
