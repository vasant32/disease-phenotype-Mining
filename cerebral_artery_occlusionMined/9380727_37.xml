<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic immunosuppressive options are limited due to systemic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We attempted to achieve immunosuppression in the brain through oral tolerance to myelin basic protein (MBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lewis rats were fed low-dose bovine MBP or ovalbumin (1 mg, five times) before 3 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third group of animals was sensitized to MBP but did not survive the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size at 24 and 96 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was significantly less in tolerized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tolerance to MBP was confirmed in vivo by a decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp> to MBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic immune responses, characterized in vitro by spleen cell proliferation to Con A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>, and MBP, again confirmed antigen-specific immunologic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed transforming growth factor beta1 production by T cells in the brains of tolerized but not control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic transforming growth factor beta1 levels were equivalent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">Corticosterone</z:chebi> levels 24 h after surgery were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sham-operated animals and ischemic control animals but not in ischemic tolerized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that antigen-specific modulation of the immune response decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that sensitization to the same antigen may actually worsen outcome </plain></SENT>
