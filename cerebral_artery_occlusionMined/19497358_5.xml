<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, Chinese Herbal Medicine with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties is believed to have potential therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, neuroprotective effects of purified Herba Leonuri (pHL) were evaluated in Wistar rats undergone middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats were treated with their respective treatments for 2 weeks prior to the MCAO, continually treated for another 7 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the post-surgery treatment period, neurological deficit score was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of treatment, animals were sacrificed and samples were collected for analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under the treatment of pHL, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced significantly from 20.75+/-0.03% to 15.19+/-0.02% (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological impairment was alleviated to 1.82 as compared to vehicle (2.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> concentration was increased from 0.31+/-0.03 mM to 0.42+/-0.05 mM (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA oxidative damage was reduced to 1.19+/-0.03 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pHL treated group (p&lt;0.05 as compared to vehicle group, 1.78+/-0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>pHL could reduce the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and also the pro-apoptotic proteins, but increase the level of anti-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: pHL is believed to have promising therapeutic effect for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment through <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
