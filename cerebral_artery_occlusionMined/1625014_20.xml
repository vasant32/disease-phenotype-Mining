<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of blood volume expansion by a colloid agent and subsequent exsanguination to baseline cardiac output (CO) on local cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique in both ischemic and nonischemic brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output was increased to maximum levels (159% +/- 92%, mean +/- standard error of the mean) by blood volume expansion with the colloid agent hetastarch, and was then reduced a similar amount (166% +/- 82%) by exsanguination during the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local CBF in ischemic brain regions varied directly with CO, with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 (% change CBF/% change CO), while CBF in nonischemic brain was not affected by upward or downward manipulations of CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in these responses between ischemic and nonischemic brain was highly significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show a profound loss of regulatory control in ischemic brain in response to alterations in CO, thereby suggesting that blood volume variations may cause significant changes in the intensity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that CO monitoring and manipulation may be vital for optimum care of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
