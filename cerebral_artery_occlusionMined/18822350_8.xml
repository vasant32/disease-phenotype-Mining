<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration can bypass blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs into the brain directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether intranasal administration of bFGF at later time points after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> could promote adult neurogenesis and improve neurologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats received bFGF or saline intranasally once daily for 6 consecutive days, starting at 1 day after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected at 5 and 6 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 7 or 28 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis was assessed by immunostaining for BrdU and cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological functions were evaluated by the modified Neurological Severity Scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control animals, intranasal administration of bFGF improved behavioral recovery without affecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and enhanced proliferation of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the new proliferated cells could differentiate into neurons (BrdU+NeuN+ cells) in the striatum and DG at 28 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intranasal administration of bFGF offers a non-invasive alternative for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
