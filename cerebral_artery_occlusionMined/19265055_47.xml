<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> leads to significant morbidity and mortality in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early reperfusion strategies remain the treatment of choice but can initiate and augment an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> causing secondary brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The understanding of postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to define the temporal and spatial infiltration of immune cell populations and their activation patterns in a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 1 hour followed by 12-hour to 7-day reperfusion in C57/BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to quantify the infiltrating immune cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Accumulation of microglia and infiltration of the ischemic hemisphere by macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) preceded the neutrophilic influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DCs were found to increase 20-fold and constituted a substantial proportion of infiltrating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DCs exhibited a significant upregulation of major histocompatibility complex II and major histocompatibility complex II high-expressing DCs were found 100 times more abundant than in sham conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD80 was observed in DCs and microglial cells but did not further increase in major histocompatibility complex II high-expressing DCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No lymphocyte activation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, regulatory immune cells (natural killer T-cells, CD4(-)/CD8(-)T lymphocytes) cumulated in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed analysis of the temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in a rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The peculiar activation pattern and massive increase of antigen-presenting cells in temporal conjunction with regulatory cells might provide additional insight into poststroke immune regulation </plain></SENT>
