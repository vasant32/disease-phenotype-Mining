<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Honokiol, a constituent of Magnolia obovata, has various pharmacological effects, including protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of honokiol against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that cerebral ischemic neuronal damage could be triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> that develops after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic stress (i.e., post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, suppression of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> significantly ameliorated ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effects of honokiol on the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> on day 1 and neuronal damage on day 3 after MCAO were significantly reduced by intraperitoneal administration of honokiol (10 mg/kg) compared with the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Honokiol did not affect serum insulin or adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, honokiol significantly decreased the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18021">phosphoenolpyruvate</z:chebi> carboxykinase and increased the expression of 5'-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on day 1 after MCAO, compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that honokiol could prevent post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in an AMPK-dependent manner, which may be involved in the neuroprotective effects of honokiol against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
