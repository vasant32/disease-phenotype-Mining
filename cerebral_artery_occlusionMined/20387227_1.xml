<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the bisbenzyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24921">isoquinoline alkaloid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">dauricine</z:chebi> can protect the brain against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated here whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">dauricine</z:chebi> could inhibit neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and modulate Bcl-2 family protein levels in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 60 min temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">dauricine</z:chebi> (5 and 10 mg/kg as low and high dose respectively) were administered intraperitoneally at 1 hour after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After neurological deficits were assessed at 3 hours and 24 hours of reperfusion, rats were killed and brain samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic changes were evaluated by TUNEL method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to assess the protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was used to determine Bcl-2 and Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">Dauricine</z:chebi> (5 and 10 mg/kg) treatment improved neurological deficits, diminished DNA fragmentation, increased Bcl-2 expression and reduced Bax expression in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-reducing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">dauricine</z:chebi> may be due, in part, to the inhibition of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via modulation Bcl-2 family protein in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
