<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is expressed by various types of cellular insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested to serve diverse functions in both cellular survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signal cascades, but the exact role of ATF3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is little known so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the authors examined the expression pattern of ATF3 following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1-2 days after MCAO and reperfusion injury, numerous number of ATF3-immunoreacitive (-ir) nuclei was observed in the ipsilateral peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex, but declined rapidly at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ATF3-ir nuclei were co-localized with NeuN-ir neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither GFAP- nor OX42-ir neuroglia were co-localized with ATF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double labeling of Fluoro-Jade B with ATF3 showed that ATF3-ir nuclei mismatched with Fluoro-Jade B-ir neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further examine the role of ATF3 in ischemic peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions, double immunofluorescent labeling of ATF3/caspase 3, ATF3/Bcl-xl, and ATF3/HSP27 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitive estimation showed that about 15% of ATF3-ir neurons also expressed caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, about only 0.4% and 2.6% of ATF3-ir neurons were double-stained with Bcl-xl and Hsp27, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it would be suggested that ATF3 seem to play an important role in caspase-dependent neuronal apoptotic signal transduction pathways caused by focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
