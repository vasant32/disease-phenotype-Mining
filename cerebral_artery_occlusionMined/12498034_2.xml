<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our own in vivo and in vitro experiments were aimed at further characterizing pharmacological effects involved in the vinpocetine-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of vinpocetine on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (obtained by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining) was studied in permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats (3 mg/kg i.p., 30 min postischemia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vinpocetine treatment significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (by 42%, p &lt; 0.05) compared to control, which was better than the effect of nimodipine (17%) or MK-801 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity measurements were made in primary cortical cell culture using LDH release as an indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vinpocetine dose-dependently inhibited prolonged (24 h) or transient (15 min) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and transient N-metil-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29994">D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (0.1-1 mM) induced excitotoxicity (IC50 = 2-7 x 10(-6) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these tests the neuroprotective potency of vinpocetine was lower than that of MK-801, but it was similar to those of flunarizine or nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results together with former literature data indicate that apovincaminic acid derivatives possessing strong neuroprotective potential may play an important role in the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
