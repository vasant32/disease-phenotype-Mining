<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation is an important means to prevent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but is associated with a significant risk of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that blood coagulation factor XII (FXII)-deficient mice are protected from pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> without bearing an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, pharmacological blockade of FXII might be a promising and safe approach to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and possibly other thromboembolic disorders but pharmacological inhibitors selective over FXII are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the efficacy of COU254, a novel nonpeptidic 3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> that selectively blocks FXII activity, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development and post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> functional outcome in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice were treated with COU254 (40 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle and subjected to 60 min transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO) using the intraluminal filament method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined from 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazoliumchloride(TTC)-stained brain sections and functional scores were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to estimate the extent of neuronal cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation within the infarcted brain areas was analyzed by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and functional outcomes on day 1 after tMCAO did not significantly differ between COU254 pre-treated mice or untreated controls (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed extensive ischemic neuronal damage regularly including the cortex and the basal ganglia in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COU254 treatment did not prevent intracerebral fibrin(ogen) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: COU254 at the given concentration of 40 mg/kg failed to demonstrate efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in this preliminary study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further preclinical evaluation of 3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23403">coumarins</z:chebi> is needed before the antithrombotic potential of this novel class of FXII inhibitors can be finally judged </plain></SENT>
