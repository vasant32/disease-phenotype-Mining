<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancrod or vehicle solution (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) were i.v. infused (0.12 IU/kg per min) via implanted mini pumps starting 0.5, 1.5, 3 or 6 h after permanent proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and lasting until brain mapping by multislice T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in vivo 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were measured before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, before pump implantation and after magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total brain lesion volumes as determined by magnetic resonance imaging 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were 131 +/- 36 (188 +/- 28)*, 151 +/- 39 (194 +/- 39)*, 147 +/- 44 (207 +/- 33)* and 209 +/- 60 (214 +/- 42) mm3 in rats with 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 h, respectively, delay of ancrod treatment (means +/- S.D., 8-11 animals/group, corresponding control groups in parentheses, *P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous i.v. ancrod infusions reduced plasma fibrinogen levels significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ancrod-treated groups as compared to vehicle-treated controls until the end of the experiments 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, significant cerebroprotection was achieved even when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ancrod therapy for lowering of the plasma fibrinogen level was delayed for up to 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge no drug efficacy has been reported so far with a therapeutic window of 3 h after permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in spontaneously hypertensive rats suggesting that ancrod may provide an efficient therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
