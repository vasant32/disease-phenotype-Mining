<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, two balloons were inflated in the left subclavian artery and the brachiocephalic trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded through a transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of the two was employed in Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">Phosphorus-31</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectra were obtained serially during 2 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after occlusion, peaks of phosphocreatine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> decreased, whereas the peak of inorganic phosphate increased and split in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracellular pH determined by chemical shift of the inorganic phosphate peak decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes were more pronounced in Group 3 when compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological study showed no infarction in Group 1 and infarcted areas in Groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The size of the infarcted area in Group 3 was larger than that in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> potentiated with the occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery by balloon catheters is a reliable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">phosphorus-31</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy is useful to understand the pathophysiological state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
