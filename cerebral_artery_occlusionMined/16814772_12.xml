<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 10) were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) was performed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 h after MCAO to determine the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> viability threshold yielding the lesion volumes that best approximated the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes at 24 h (experiment 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For assessment of neuroprotective effects, rats were treated with 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA, n = 15) or normobaric room air (n = 15) for 60 min beginning 180 min after MCAO (experiment 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI-, perfusion (PWI)- and T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) started within 0.5 h after MCAO and was continued 5 h, 24 h (PWI and T2WI only), and 168 h (T2WI only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated based on TTC-staining at 24 h (experiment 1) or 168 h (experiment 2) post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-lesion evolution was maximal between 3 and 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, the relative regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) of both groups showed similar incomplete spontaneous reperfusion in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HBO reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 145.3 +/- 39.6 mm3 vs. 202.5 +/- 58.3 mm3 (control, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As shown by MRI and TTC, HBO treatment demonstrated significant neuroprotection at 5 h after embolic focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that lasted for 168 h </plain></SENT>
