<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated both structural and functional <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and these changes may be enhanced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated several indexes of both <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and two different models of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (insulinopenic and insulin-resistant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) with or without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensory motor cortex (layer-5 and -6) and the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus were analyzed following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that both insulinopenic and insulin-resistant diabetic rats have increased basal level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> that is uniformly and bilaterally distributed as indicated by both caspase-3 activity and TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was further increased in both diabetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion after a 2 h MCAO compared to 24 h MCAO was associated with a decrease in TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity in the control animal but exacerbated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, especially in the hippocampus of insulin-resistant diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCAO-induced lesion volumes were greater in insulinopenic rats compared to insulin-resistant and control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both insulinopenic and insulin-resistant diabetic animals have <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in response to MCAO, and restoration of blood flow especially in the insulinopenic diabetic animals paradoxically exacerbates this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, restoration of blood flow did not decrease lesion volume in insulinopenic diabetic animals </plain></SENT>
