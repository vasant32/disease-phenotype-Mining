<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neural stem cells (NSCs) or neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from various sources are known to survive and improve neurological functions when they are engrafted in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we successfully differentiated iPSCs derived from human fibroblasts into NPCs and found their robust therapeutic potential in a rodent MCAo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed the significant graftinduced behavioral recovery, as well as extensive neural tissue formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animal MRI results indicated that the majority of contra-laterally transplanted iPSC-derived NPCs migrated to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, showing a patho-tropism critical for tissue recovery </plain></SENT>
