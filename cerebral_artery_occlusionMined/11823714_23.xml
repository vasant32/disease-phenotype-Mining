<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two types of ischemic tolerance in the brain, rapid and delayed, have been reported in terms of the interval between the conditioning and test insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many reports showed that delayed-phase neuroprotection evoked by preconditioning is evident after 1 week or longer, there have been a few investigations about rapidly induced tolerance, and the reported neuroprotective effects become ambiguous 7 days after the insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined whether this rapid ischemic tolerance exists after 7 days of reperfusion in a rat focal ischemic model, and investigated modulating effects of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A 1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> DPCPX (8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-1,3-dipropylxanthine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with 30 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 7 days after 180 minutes of subsequent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> given after 1-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rapid preconditioning also improved neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These beneficial effects were attenuated by pretreatment of 0.1 mg/kg DPCPX, which did not influence the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after conditioning (30 minutes) or test (180 minutes) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that preconditioning with a brief focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induces rapid tolerance to a subsequent severe ischemic insult, the effect of which is still present after 7 days of reperfusion, and that the rapid ischemic tolerance is possibly mediated through an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A 1 receptor-related mechanism </plain></SENT>
