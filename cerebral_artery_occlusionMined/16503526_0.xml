<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> sequelae was established by means of craniectomy in which the right common carotid artery was ligated with 4-0 silk thread followed by cauterization of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Programmed electric shock was administered 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for 2 h daily for 20 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats in sham operation group were not subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery or right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats in the treatment groups were given oral BYHWD for 15 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the intake of BrdU in the cerebral tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral tissues of BYHWD-treated rats was significantly greater than that in the untreated model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BYHWD can promote nerve proliferation in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> sequelae </plain></SENT>
