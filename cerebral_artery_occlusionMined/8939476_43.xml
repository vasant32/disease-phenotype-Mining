<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we determined the effect of inhibiting TNF-alpha on the microvascular perfusion impairment and ischemic injury induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha activity was inhibited with recombinant type I soluble TNF receptor (TNFbp; 1 mg/kg i.v., 0.5 h pre- or post-MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNFbp significantly attenuated the microvessel perfusion impairment observed in vehicle treated rats, particularly in perifocal/penumbral regions of cortex, and significantly reduced (by 34-38%) the total volume of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha contributes to focal ischemic injury and that inhibition of TNF-alpha can confer dramatic neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of the neuroprotective effect of TNFbp with improved microvascular perfusion suggests that inflammatory and vascular responses to TNF-alpha contribute to its pathological action </plain></SENT>
