<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral tests of a forelimb-reaching task suggested that the disabled function of the impaired forelimb in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model was ameliorated by the implant to a certain extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These behavioral findings were correlated with immunohistochemical results of investigating the distribution of NgR antibody, neurofilaments (NF) and neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TuJ1) in the brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The porous hydrogel functioned as a scaffold to deliver the NgR antibody, support cell migration and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was found NF-positive and TuJ1-positive expressions were distributed in the implanted hydrogel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the results demonstrate the promise of the HA hydrogel as a scaffold material and the delivery vehicle of the NgR antibody for the repair of defects and the support of neural regeneration in the brain </plain></SENT>
