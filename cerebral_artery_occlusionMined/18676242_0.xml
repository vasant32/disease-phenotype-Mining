<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultured hippocampal NSCs isolated from neonate rats were labeled with BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four rats subjected to transient MCAO were randomized equally into 4 groups, namely group A (MCAO model group), group B (model group with NGF treatment, group C (model group with NSC transplantation), and group D (model group with both NGF and NSC transplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits of the rats were evaluated with neurological severity score (NSS) after the treatment, and the brain tissues were examined with immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining for BrdU and nestin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NSS of rats in group D 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation was significantly lower than that in the other 3 groups (P&lt;0.05), and the scores in groups B and C were significantly lower than those in group A (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of BrdU- and nestin-positive cells was significantly greater in group B than in group A (P&lt;0.05), and BrdU-positive cells were markedly more numerous in group D than in group C (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both NSC transplantation and NGF treatment can obviously improve the neurological function of rats after MCAO, but their combined use shows stronger effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGF can promote autologous NSC activation and proliferation, with also stimulatory effect on the proliferation of transplanted NSCs </plain></SENT>
