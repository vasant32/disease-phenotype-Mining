<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent developments in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have enabled the pathological changes that occur during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present studies utilised DWI to investigate the development of early ischaemic changes following permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat, which represents a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increased DWI signal was seen in the region of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and this was detectable as early as 1 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI images were obtained at nine stereotactic levels throughout the brain, providing a quantifiable measure of the volume of increased signal intensity in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion the hyperintense areas were seen in the frontoparietal cortex and lateral caudate nucleus; these areas represent the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and no protection is seen with any compounds in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive increase in the area of hyperintensity up to 4 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and at this time point the hyper-intensity was seen in the dorsolateral cortex and caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion there was a significant correlation between the volume of hemispheric and cortical ischaemic damage measured using DWI and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that the increased DWI signal seen during the early time points after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was demarcating tissue that was destined for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area beyond the hyperintense region at 1 h represents the so-called "penumbral" region, because with increasing time (post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) this area became incorporated into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a slight increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size between 4 and 24 h, when assessed using DWI or histology, although two groups of animals were being compared, as opposed to the time-course study, in which just one group of animals was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 24 h post-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion there was a good correlation between DWI, histology, and conventional T2 weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no further increase in size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> between 24 h and 7 days as assessed using histology and T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DWI could not be used to quantify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 7 days because there was no uniform signal in the damaged area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 7 days the area of infarction actually appeared to be darker in the diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The hyperintensity seen in diffusion-weighted images appears to decrease some time between 24 h and 7 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
