<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following MCAO, CBF reduction was severe in A (&lt;15 ml 100 g-1 min-1) and mild to moderate in SF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prominent elevation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and abolition of evoked potentials in A contrasted with milder and more variable disturbances in SF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, recovery of CBF, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and evoked potentials was fast and persistent in the 1- and 2-h groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 4-h group, immediate recovery of CBF, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and evoked potentials was incomplete, and secondary deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters was obtained at the end of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction in the 4-h group was significantly larger than in the 1- and 2-h groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persistent recovery of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration and electrical function and salvage of neuronal tissue from infarction therefore seem to depend on successful restoration of CBF, which in turn depends on the magnitude and the duration of CBF reduction and of exposure to potentially harmful substances such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> during the ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
