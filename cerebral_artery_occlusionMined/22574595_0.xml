<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the EA group (n = 30), the sham-EA group (n = 30), the model group (n = 30), the sham-operation group (n = 30), and the blank group (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The modified ZeaLonga method was used to prepare the left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model in the first three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the operation Baihui (DU20) and Dazhui (DU14) were daily needled in the EA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One inch beside Baihui (DU20) and Dazhui (DU14) were daily needled in the sham-EA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in the model group were only treated with MCAO <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats in the sham-operation group only received surgical wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No treatment was given to rats in the blank group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructures of ischemic cells and the intervention of the Nogo-A expressions were observed using the immunohistochemical staining and the transmission electron microscope 1, 7, and 28 days after EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In the EA group, the damage of ultrastructures of neurons, gliocytes, and blood brain barrier in the ischemic region was alleviated when compared with that of the sham-EA group and the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) On the 1st, 7th and 28th day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion, the expressions of Nogo-A in the ischemic cortex in the EA group was lower when compared with those in the sham-EA group and the model group at the corresponding time points, showing significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But there was no statistical difference between the sham-EA group and the model group at the same time point (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mechanism of EA for protecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion might be closely associated with alleviating the damage on the ultrastructures of brain cells, and down-regulating the expressions of Nogo-A </plain></SENT>
