<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variable ischemic inductions are attributed to the different contributing factors in ischemic damage formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the differences in ischemic induction attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to two kinds of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, a thermocoagulation and a photothrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the changes in body weight, neurological outcome, size of ischemic damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> formation, and histological data for 84 days between a thermocoagulation and a photothrombosis model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the time courses of infarction formation were no different, there were differences in the time courses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> formation, and neuronal deficits between the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microinfarction formation was observed as a characteristic of the photothrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that differences in ischemic induction did not affect maturation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, or neuronal deficits 84 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the progress of maturation was different between the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility that reperfusion contributed to the time course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was considered, and it was suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation influenced neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
