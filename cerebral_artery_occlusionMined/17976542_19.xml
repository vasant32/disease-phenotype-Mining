<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) have the potential to improve neurological function when transplanted into animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still obscure how the transplanted BMSC restore the lost neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, therefore, we aimed to elucidate the role of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its specific receptor, CXCR4, in BMSC transplantation into the brain subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BMSC were harvested from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and CXCR4-knockout (CXCR4-KO) mice and were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WT or CXCR4-KO BMSC was injected into the ipsilateral striatum 7 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Motor function of the animals was serially evaluated, using a rotarod treadmill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the distribution and phenotype of the transplanted cells 4 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recovery of motor function in the WT BMSC-transplanted mice was more pronounced than in the CXCR4-KO-transplanted mice and the vehicle-treated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 was extensively expressed in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the WT BMSC-transplanted mice, the transplanted cells were extensively distributed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and many of them migrated towards the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and expressed the proteins specific for neurons and astrocytes, although these findings were not observed in the CXCR4-KO-transplanted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the SDF-1/CXCR4 system may play a critical role in the survival, proliferation and migration of the transplanted BMSC and contribute to recovery of neurological function </plain></SENT>
