<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, promotes functional recovery and neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil (Viagra) was administered orally for 7 consecutive days starting 2 or 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at doses of 2 or 5 mg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic rats administered the same volume of tap water were used as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome tests (foot-fault, adhesive removal) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed 28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and newly generated cells within the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain cGMP levels, expression of PDE5, and localized cerebral blood flow were measured in additional rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with sildenafil significantly (P&lt;0.05) enhanced neurological recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tests performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume among the experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with sildenafil significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-immunoreactive cells in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus and numbers of immature neurons, as indicated by betaIII-tubulin (TuJ1) immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral subventricular zone and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cortical levels of cGMP significantly increased after administration of sildenafil, and PDE5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was present in both nonischemic and ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil increases brain levels of cGMP, evokes neurogenesis, and reduces neurological deficits when given to rats 2 or 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this drug that is presently in the clinic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> may have a role in promoting recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
