<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this research, we investigated striatal neurogenesis in 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats after cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were subjected to a 20-min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), given 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 30 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily during days 4-7 and sacrificed 2 weeks after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurogenesis was assessed with double immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence labeling of BrdU and doublecortin (DCX), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), or 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD(67)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats, the numbers of nestin(+), BrdU(+)-DCX(+) (a marker of newborn neuronal progenitors/immature neuron), BrdU(+)-MAP-2(+) (a marker of newborn mature neuron), and BrdU(+)-GAD(67)(+) (a marker of newborn GABAergic neuron) cells decreased dramatically in the ipsilateral striatum to MCAO compared with that in 3-month-old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced striatal neurogenesis still existed in aging rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the capacity of neurogenesis in older rats was considerably lower than that in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neural precursors and immature neurons, indicated by double labeling of active caspase-3 and nestin/DCX/Tuj-1(beta-tubulin III)/CRMP-4 (collapsin response-mediated protein-4), increased noticeably in the ipsilateral striatum of older rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results suggested that aging-related attenuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced striatal neurogenesis might be related to decrease of neural precursors and increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of newborn neurons </plain></SENT>
