<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a previous investigation concerning the hemodynamic and metabolic changes over time displayed by sequential <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion/reperfusion primate model, a metabolic threshold for irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> could be identified (reduction of metabolic rate of oxygen [CMRO(2)] to approximately 60% of the contralateral hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential of microdialysis (MD) as an instrument for chemical brain monitoring, the aim of this subsequent study was to relate the chemical changes in MD levels directly to the regional metabolic status (CMRO(2) above or below the metabolic threshold) and the occurrence of reperfusion, as assessed by PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous MD (2 probes in each brain) and sequential PET measurements were performed during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (2 hours) and 18 hours (mean) of reperfusion in 8 monkeys (Macaca mulatta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy-related metabolites (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MD probe regions were divided into 3 categories on the basis of whether CMRO(2) was below or above 60% of the contralateral region (metabolic threshold level) during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and whether reperfusion was obtained: severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion (n=4), severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> without reperfusion (n=4), and penumbra with reperfusion (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> showed similar patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MD probe regions with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion and probe regions with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and no reperfusion displayed high and broad peaks, respectively, during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and the levels almost never decreased to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Penumbra MD probe regions displayed only slight transient increases during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and returned to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This experimental study of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed that the extracellular changes of energy-related metabolites and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> differed depending on the ischemic state of the brain during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and depending on whether reperfusion occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If MD proves to be beneficial in clinical practice, it appears important to observe relative changes over time </plain></SENT>
