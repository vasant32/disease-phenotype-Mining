<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of an anti-P-selectin antibody (RMP-1) on ischemic cell damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into four groups: (1) antibody (Ab) 1 group (n = 14) RMP-1 (2 mg/kg) was administered to rats 1 h prior to induction of 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; (2) control-vehicle group Ab2 (n = 12) rats were subjected to the same experimental protocol, except that an isotype-matched control antibody was administered; (3) Abl group (n = 10) rats were subjected to 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and RMP-1 (2 mg/kg) was administered upon reperfusion; (4) control-vehicle group Ab2 (n = 10) rats were subjected to the same experimental protocol, except that an isotype-matched control antibody was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the MCAo for histological evaluation of infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and to quantify number of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume was significantly smaller only in pretreated rats (RMP-1 group, 18.7+/-3.1%) compared to the vehicle-treated (31.6+/-2.6%) group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (5.94 x 10(3)+/-2.86 x 10(3) microm2) in the pre MCAo RMP-1 treated group animals was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.02) compared to the vehicle group (6.1 x 10(4)+/-3.42 x 10(4) microm2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that administration of the anti-P-selectin antibody before transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat brain reduces ischemic cell damage and petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
