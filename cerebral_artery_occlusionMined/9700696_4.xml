<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, even if delayed, markedly enlarges the volume of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we used in situ hybridization autoradiography to assess the effects of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> on the regional expression of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) for the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun, the inducible heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) following 1 h of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) produced in rats by the insertion of an intraluminal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham-occluded rats were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after MCAo, rats were placed into a heating chamber, where cranial temperature was either maintained at 37-38 degrees C (normothermic group) or was elevated to 40 degrees C (hyperthermic group) for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At either 2 or 24 h thereafter, brains were studied by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-level constitutive c-fos and c-jun expression in sham-occluded rats was unaffected by delayed temperature manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior MCAo decreased c-fos and c-jun <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the affected striatum and overlying cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In rats studied 2 h after delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, however, c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was markedly increased in ipsilateral cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the pattern of c-jun <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was similar in rats with prior MCAo irrespective of delayed normothermia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>: increased expression involved ipsilateral cingulate and paramedian cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bilateral increases in hsp70 expression were produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> alone, and hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was densely increased throughout the ischemic cortex and striatum following MCAo, while delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> altered this pattern by extending the zone of increased hsp70 message to cingulate and paramedian cortical areas at 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was decreased within the previously ischemic field but increased in surrounding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The induction of c-fos and hsp70 message in tissue regions abutting zones of enhanced injury in brains with delayed postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> indicates that these zones have been additionally stressed: these gene responses may possibly contribute to the protection of these threatened regions </plain></SENT>
