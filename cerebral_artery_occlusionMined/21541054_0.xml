<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rho kinase (ROCK) is a well-known downstream effector of Rho and plays an important role in various physiopathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aim to investigate the correlation between ROCK and microvascular damage in rat brain subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion, and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the microvascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ROCK and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were determined by real time quantitative PCR, Laminin was detected by immunofluorescence and Blood Brain Barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability was examined by Evans Blue (EB) in rat MCAO models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed similar patterns of changes in ROCK expression, brain EB content, and Laminin expression at different time points after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis further confirmed a significant linear correlation of ROCK expression with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of microvascular damage in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ROCK inhibitor fasudil decreased brain EB content but increased Laminin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide strong evidence that ROCK mediates microvascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that fasudil could significantly inhibit MMP9 expression induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggest that ROCK promotes microvascular damage by upregulating MMP9 and reveal ROCK as a promising therapeutic target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
