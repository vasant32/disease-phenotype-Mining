<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA-15) is prominently expressed in astrocytes that exert broad anti-apoptotic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> modulates PEA-15 and levels of two phosphorylated PEA-15 (Serine 104 and 116) in an animal model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (500 mg/kg) 2 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO and cerebral cortices were collected at 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a proteomic approach, MCAO induced decreases of PEA-15 levels, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> treatment attenuated the injury-induced decrease in PEA-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of Western blot analysis suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> prevented injury-induced reduction in phospho-PEA-15 (Serine 104) and phospho-PEA-15 (Serine 116) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of PEA-15 exerts anti-apoptotic functions, and reduction of PEA-15 phosphorylation leads to apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> exerts a neuroprotective effect by attenuating the injury-induced decreases of PEA-15 and phospho-PEA-15 (Ser 104 and Ser 116) proteins </plain></SENT>
