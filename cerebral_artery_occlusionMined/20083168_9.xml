<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been reported to be implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> resulting from a variety of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine if 10% hypertonic saline ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> through downregulation of AQP4 expression in the perivascular astrocytes in the ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to permanent right-sided middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and treated with a continuous i.v. infusion of 10% HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain water content (BWC) analyzed by wet-to-dry ratios in the ischemic hemisphere of SD rats was attenuated after 10% HS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was coupled with the reduction of neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the peri-ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, downregulated expression of AQP4 in the perivascular astrocytes after 10% HS treatment was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that in addition to its osmotic force, 10% HS exerts anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> effects possibly through downregulation of AQP4 expression in the perivascular astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after 10% HS administration can prevent ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
