<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">Galangin</z:chebi> is a natural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> isolated from the rhizome of Alpina officinarum Hance, which has been widely used as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have not been reported and its related neuroprotective mechanism has not really been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, neurological behavior, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and the improvement of the regional cortical blood flow (rCBF) were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">galangin</z:chebi> in rats impaired by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO)-induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and Western blot of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins were performed to interpret the neuroprotective mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">galangin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">galangin</z:chebi> alleviated the neurologic impairments, reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 24 h after MCAO and exerted a protective effect on the mitochondria with decreased production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were consistent with improvements in the membrane potential level (Dym), membrane fluidity, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">galangin</z:chebi> significantly improved the reduced rCBF after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5262">galangin</z:chebi> also inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a dose-dependent manner concomitant with the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, down-regulation of Bax expression and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, a reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, the reduced expression of activated caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) </plain></SENT>
