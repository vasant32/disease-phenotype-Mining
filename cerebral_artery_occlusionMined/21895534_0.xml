<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin IV (Ang IV) provides protection against brain injury caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ang IV is a potent inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the effect of IRAP gene inactivation on neuroprotection following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IRAP knockout mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls were subjected to 2 h of transient MCAo using the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, neurological deficits of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced mice were assessed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured by TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the IRAP knockout mice compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates with corresponding improvement in neurological performance at 24 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in compensatory cerebral blood flow during MCAo was observed in the IRAP knockout animals with no differences in cerebral vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current study demonstrates that deletion of the IRAP gene protects the brain from ischemic damage analogous to the effect of the IRAP inhibitor, Ang IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that IRAP is potentially a new therapeutic target for the development of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
