<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study on the added value of two D-dimer assays over clinical assessment for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical evaluation using the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project (OCSP) classification and measurement of plasma D-dimer levels by the VIDAS D-dimer test (VIDAS) and the Triage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Panel (TSP) were performed in 128 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> presenting within 9 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was defined as small-artery or large-artery infarction based on the TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall accuracy for diagnosing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using the OCSP classification, VIDAS (cut point for D-dimer 445 ng/mL) or TSP (cut point 300 ng/mL) was 89%, 88% and 87% respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conjunctive use of the OCSP classification and VIDAS or TSP improved the accuracy to 97% and 98% respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kappa coefficient for agreement between the two assays was acceptable (kappa, 0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were reproducible in subgroups of patients presenting within 4.5 h and within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> can reliably be made, based on the conjunctive use of clinical evaluation and measurement of D-dimer levels either by a standard assay or by a bedside testing kit </plain></SENT>
