<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The authors have undertaken a study of their intraoperative experience with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> fluorescence videoangiography (ICGFV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the intuitiveness, image quality and clinical utility of this technology have been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of forty-six consecutive craniotomies utilising ICGFV have been retrospectively reviewed: There were 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2 extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypasses, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), 1 dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF), 3 cavernomas, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICGFV was used in 5 awake-craniotomy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICGFV was performed using a Leica OH4 surgical microscope with integrated near-infrared camera and ICG-PULSION </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> attempts of intraoperative ICGFV were intuitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image quality and resolution were excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial and venous phases were comparable to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) but field of view was relatively limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 12 operations (26%) the surgeon was substantially benefited from ICGFV findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 22 operations (48%), ICGFV was useful but did not influence surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICGFV was of no benefit in 11 operations (24%) and was misleading in 1 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this series, ICGFV was of benefit to 1 of 11 (9%) patients with an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICGFV is safe, intuitive and provides neurosurgeons with high quality, valuable, real-time imaging of cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It can assist in intraoperative surgical management and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention particularly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, EC-IC bypass and <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>/DAVF surgery </plain></SENT>
