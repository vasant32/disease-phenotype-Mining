<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We developed an individualized off-pump approach in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> internal thoracic artery (AITA) composite graft revascularization (AITACR) program to minimize postoperative neurological complications and to obtain the best long-term results possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early results of the individualized approach are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The operative method (on-pump or off-pump) was determined based on institutional selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early neurological outcomes were evaluated in 157 men and 42 women; the mean age was 67.3 +/- 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine underwent off-pump procedures and 140 on-pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The off-pump patients were older than the on-pump patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, history of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and atherosclerotic disease in the ascending aorta was more frequent in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of distal anastomoses was 3.2 +/- 0.9 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (1 in the off-pump group and 2 in the on-pump group) had postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> possibly related to postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When patients were allocated to the on-pump group or the off-pump group based on our criteria, excellent results were achieved with acceptable morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An individualized off-pump approach in an AITACR program appears reasonable and safe with excellent early neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
