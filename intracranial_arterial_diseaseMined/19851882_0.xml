<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients on maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients with intracranial artery calcification into two groups according to the duration of maintenance hemodialysis and compared the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>intracranial calcification</z:hpo> of each of the intracranial arteries between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial artery calcification was found in 36 of the 50 hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 36 patients with intracranial artery calcification, the prevalence of calcification of each of the arteries was as follows: vertebral artery, 58.3%; internal carotid artery, 61.1%; basilar artery, 41.7%; anterior cerebral artery, 16.7%; middle cerebral artery, 30.6%; posterior cerebral artery, 8.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of calcification of each of the intracranial arteries did not differ significantly between the patients with a hemodialysis duration of more than 20 years and those less than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently involved site of calcification was the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of calcification of the other intracranial arteries, particularly of the basilar artery, were relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of calcification of each of the intracranial arteries did not differ significantly between the patients with a hemodialysis duration of more than 20 years and less than 20 years </plain></SENT>
