<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aortic arch atheromas (AAs) have been shown to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) in the elderly because of their potential for cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between AAs and the presence of cerebral microemboli has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether large AAs are associated with an increased frequency of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in elderly patients with IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed bitemporal simultaneous HITS monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries in 62 consecutive elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS (mean age 72.5+/-8.8 years, 65% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients, one or both temporal windows were inadequate; therefore, the analysis of HITS was performed in the remaining 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent omniplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and they had no significant extracranial or intracranial artery disease and no cardiac prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large AA was defined as &gt; or = 4 mm in thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complex AA was defined as ulcerated or mobile, regardless of plaque thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HITS monitoring was performed within 24 hours of TEE and analyzed by an experienced neurologist-sonographer blinded to TEE findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 9-dB threshold was chosen to discriminate HITS from background Doppler signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HITS counts in the left and in the right middle cerebral arteries were added and reported as a total number of HITS in 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were detected in 14 (78%) of 18 patients with large AAs versus 8 (29%) of 28 patients with no or small AAs (odds ratio [OR] 8.8, 95% CI 2.2 to 34.8; P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association was also present in 27 patients with no other cardiac embolic sources, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, spontaneous echo contrast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (7 of 10 patients with large AAs versus 3 of 17 patients with small or no AA; OR 10.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 68.5; P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complex AAs were associated with a higher frequency of HITS than were noncomplex AAs (6 of 6 patients with complex AAs versus 15 of 39 patients with noncomplex AAs; OR 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>6, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.9; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS are significantly associated with large AAs in elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This observation may support the causal role of large AAs in IS </plain></SENT>
