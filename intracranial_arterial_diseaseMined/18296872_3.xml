<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is now indicated for cervical ICA stenosis, but the safety and the efficacy of urgent CAS have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients treated by urgent CAS for atherosclerotic occlusive lesions of cervical ICA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had complete occlusions and five had near total occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of the 10 patients had intracranial tandem occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indication for urgent CAS was determined by mismatch of diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stents were successfully deployed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of five patients with concomitant intracranial tandem occlusions were treated by additional intraarterial fibrinolysis after the CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were completely recanalized in one patient, and partially recanalized in two by fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion syndrome did not occur in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale &lt; or =1) was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the five patients with isolated cervical ICA occlusion and one of the five patients with intracranial tandem occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Urgent CAS is a safe and effective treatment in patients with isolated cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment of intracranial tandem occlusions is an issue that must be resolved </plain></SENT>
