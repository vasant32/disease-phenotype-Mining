<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 12 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (8 men and 4 women; mean age = 60 years) who had a previous history of radiation therapy because of head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT/MRI and angiography were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesions generally occurred at the areas compatible with the radiation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was observed in 7 patients, and 5 of them had neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vascular lesions were documented in 7, which included distal vertebral and/or basilar artery in 3, and distal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of them had head <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the irradiation and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 8.5 years, which tended to be short in patients with intracranial diseases as compared to those with extracranial diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial diseases</z:e> are at least as frequent as extracranial diseases in patients with radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This potential hazard of radiotherapy should be considered in treating patients with head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
