<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cognitive performance in subjects with bilateral asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (B-ACS) compared to subjects with unilateral ACS and to subjects with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (CS) and to explore the relationship between cognitive performance and cerebral hemodynamics status in B-ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The neuropsychological investigation included phonemic (ph) and categorical (ca) Verbal Fluency (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) tests for exploring the left brain functions and Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM) and Complex Figure Copy Test (CFCT) for the right brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemodynamics status was assessed using the transcranial Doppler-based breath-holding index test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 333 subjects were included: 127 B-ACS, 73/77 left/right unilateral ACS, 56 no CS, mean age 70 Â± 3.78 years, 65 male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with B-ACS and subjects with unilateral ACS showed significantly lower scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cognitive tests compared to subjects with no CS (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with B-ACS with left impaired hemodynamics status showed a significantly reduced ph-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> score, from 13.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2-15.8) to 7.5 (95% CI 5.4-9.7), and a reduced ca-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> score, from 19.7 (95% CI 18.1-24.1) to 10.8 (95% CI 9.5-15.1), compared to subjects with no CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, impaired cerebral hemodynamics in the right side was associated with a significantly reduced CPM score, from an estimated mean of 34.2 (95% CI 29.8-35.4) to 24.6 (95% CI 20.2-25.8), and CFCT score from 37.0 (95% CI 32.0-37.4) to 27.1 (95% CI 23.3-28.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> comparisons were p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subjects with B-ACS and subjects with unilateral ACS are more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> compared to subjects with no CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a link between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and hemodynamics impairment due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
