<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 494 consecutive cases of clinically diagnosed non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in ED involving PMMDCT were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fatal findings were detected on PMMDCT and classified as definite or possible findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by autopsy in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fatal findings were detected in 188 subjects (38.1%) including 122 with definite (24.7%) and 66 with possible finding (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Definite findings included 21 cases of intracranial vascular lesions, 84 with intra-thoracic haemorrhage, 13 with retroperitoneal haemorrhage and one with oesophagogastric haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients who had initially been diagnosed with non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, PMMDCT revealed fatal traumatic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two definite findings (two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1144803,C0494588" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemopericardiums</z:e>) and seven possible findings (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstructions</z:hpo>, one each of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumours</z:e> central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004927'>pulmonary artery dilatation</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473120" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peritoneal haematoma</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo>) were confirmed by autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were not determined in cases with possible findings without autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PMMDCT is a feasible tool for detecting morphological fatal findings in non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is important to know the ability and limitation of PMMDCT </plain></SENT>
