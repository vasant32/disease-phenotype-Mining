<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 86 patients investigated were divided following radiographic angiography (RGA) into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (n = 26) and into patients with intracranial (n = 22) and extracranial (n = 38) vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with angiographically demonstrated CBVD, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> detected 90%, DS 53.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 93.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> was excluded, the sensitivity of the studies was 92.1% for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and 84.2% for DS and combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 97.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy by combined evaluation was 93.8% for the extracranial arterial lesions if the clinical findings were also used in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RGA pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DS complement each other as <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> contributes to the detection of intracranial blood flow alterations indicating vascular changes in either the extra- or intra-cranial vessels and helps confirm and complete DS findings </plain></SENT>
