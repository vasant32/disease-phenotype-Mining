<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to detect changes in D-dimer levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients as a function of the time of artery recanalization and the therapy used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a 12-month period, 80 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to the hospital within a 6-h time window were consecutively enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical neurologic examination, brain computed tomography, neurosonologic examination, and biochemical and hematological blood tests (including D-dimers and fibrinogen) were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control examinations of D-dimer and fibrinogen blood levels were performed 3 (optional), 6, and 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA test, multiple comparison test, and Pearson test were used for statistical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application of intravenous thrombolysis significantly increased the D-dimer levels and decreased the fibrinogen level 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in comparison with patients treated with antiplatelets or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01), with normalization of blood levels over a 24 h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of sonothrombotripsy showed a tendency to increase the D-dimer levels (P = 0.09) with a significant decrease of the fibrinogen level 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the D-dimer levels was detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of cardioembolic and atherothrombotic etiologies, and patients with occlusion of cervical or large intracranial arteries (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the changes in D-dimer or fibrinogen levels and age, gender, time to artery recanalization, risk factors, and the seriousness of neurologic deficits on admission (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>D-dimer levels significantly increased during the first 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients with large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and patients treated using intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this increase was independent on the time of artery recanalization thus cannot be used as its marker </plain></SENT>
