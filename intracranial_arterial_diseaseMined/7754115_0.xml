<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at investigating the diagnostic role of 3D CTA in the intracranial and extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with intracranial artery disease (thirteen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>) and fifteen patients with stenosis of the common, internal or external carotid arteries underwent 3D CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been examined with intraarterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT examinations were performed with dynamic scanning during intravenous contrast agent administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-millimeter thick contiguous slices were obtained in the cervical region and 1.5-mm contiguous slices in the intracranial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT findings were processed to produce 3D views on an independent workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3D CTA results were compared with those of intraarterial DSA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreement was found in 13 of 15 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, and in 26 of the 30 carotid arteries in classifying the severity of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3D views, which exhibit an excellent image quality, seem to be comparable to angiography in the intracranial and extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main advantages of this technique are: 1) its low invasivity since only an intravenous contrast agent injection is required; 2) its easy and fast acquisition (2-3 minutes are needed if a non-spiral CT unit is used and less than one minute with spiral CT); 3) good demonstration of the calcified plaques which can be also removed with the softwares available at the workstation, to show the overall vessel lumen; 4) thanks to its simplicity the examination can also be performed in emergency (i.e. in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, if plain CT is positive for subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its main limitations are: 1) the need of an adequate concentration of contrast agent in the vessels; 2) artifacts due to calcified and bone structures; 3) no information about vessel inflow; 4) limited discrimination between arteries and veins in some areas (cavernous sinus); 5) limited field of view compared to angiography </plain></SENT>
