<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis using primary angioplasty or stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both primary angioplasty and stent placement have been proposed as treatment modalities, but long-term outcome comparisons are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined rates of technical success and rates of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, second procedure, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis (&gt;or=70% in severity and/or medication failure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posttreatment angiographic stenosis was measured by independent reviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was used preferentially in patients with more technically challenging lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>- or repeat procedure-free survival between the two treatment modalities over periods of 12 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the differential risk of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after either angioplasty or stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (mean age, 62 +/- 13 yr) were treated with primary angioplasty and 22 patients (mean age, 58 +/-14 yr) with stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis (+/-standard deviation) decreased from 76 +/- 13% to 28 +/- 18% in the primary angioplasty-treated and from 68 +/- 9% to 17 +/- 13% in the stent-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in time to major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (log-rank statistic, 0.44; P = 0.5), and time to major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, repeat procedure, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (log-rank statistic, 0.78; P = 0.4) between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival was 95% (+/- standard error of 4%) for the stent-treated patients and 93% (+/- standard error of 7%) for the angioplasty-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the risk of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between angioplasty and stent placement (P = 0.996) using Cox proportional hazards analysis after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, qualifying event, preprocedure stenosis, and target vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of primary angioplasty and primary stent placement were comparable at intermediate follow-up examination after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results highlight the need for carefully designed, randomized clinical trials to determine the precise value of stent placement in the intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
