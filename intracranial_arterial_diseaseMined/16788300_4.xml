<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The predictive value of asymptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk of asymptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and to compare it with that of extracranial artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were 2,924 participants (mean age 55 years) without any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the relation between intra- or extracranial large-artery disease and subsequent cerebrovascular events (mean follow-up 63 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence rate of total cerebrovascular events in persons with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was 1.3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group without plaque in the extracranial carotid arteries, the annual rate of total cerebrovascular events was only 0.6%, but in the group with plaque, the rate was 3.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis of total events showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in subjects with asymptomatic extracranial artery disease is markedly increased if intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is also present </plain></SENT>
