<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It was demonstrated the some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have intracranial stenosis of 50% or greater and the identification of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> is extremely important in order to plan a correct therapeutical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the image quality and intertechnique agreement of various postprocessing methods in the detection of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients who were studied by using a multidetector row CT scanner were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2040 segments were examined in the 85 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vasculature was assessed by using MPR, CPR, MIP, and VR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists reviewed the CT images independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cohen weighted kappa statistic was applied to calculate interobserver agreement and for image accuracy for each reconstruction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV were also calculated by using the consensus read as the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen (10.5%) stenosed artery segments were identified by the observers in consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best intermethod kappa values between observers 1 and 2 were obtained by VR and MIP (kappa values of 0.878 and 0.861, respectively), whereas MPR provided the lowest value (kappa value of 0.282) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VR showed a sensitivity for detecting stenosed segments of 88.8% and 91.6% for observers 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The highest positive predictive value was also obtained by VR at 95% and 99% for observers 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Image accuracy obtained by using VR was the highest among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reconstruction methods in both observers (185/255 and 177/255 for observers 1 and 2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that VR and MIP techniques provide the best interobserver and intertechnique concordance in the analysis of intravascular cranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
