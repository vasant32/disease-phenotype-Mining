<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a clinical series of twelve of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were treated exclusively with endovascular coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with coil embolization was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical notes and radiological images were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve superior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in eleven patients between 1992 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, two with neurologic deficit, and two had asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coiling resulted in complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration in six patients and incomplete obliteration in the other six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred with follow-up between 6 and 119 months (mean follow-up 50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedural morbidity was one superior cerebellar artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with good recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Management morbidity was one middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> during a follow-up angiogram that required thrombolysis with a good clinical result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 11 patients on follow-up were performing at Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient with GOS 3 presented with a poor grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the other patient with GOS 4 presented with a parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of superior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is an effective treatment strategy with low morbidity </plain></SENT>
