<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether CT angiography is suitable for the evaluation of in-stent restenoses in small vessel stents for intracranial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we simulated stenoses with degrees of 25, 50, 75 and 90% in a total of 12 stents with different designs (MEDTRONIC AVE; ABBOT BioDivYsio, GUIDANT Neurolink, TERUMO Tsunami, COOK V-Flex Plus) and sizes (3.0 mm, 4.0 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each stenosis, the apparent stenotic degree (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) was measured by CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjective (viewing at the CT images) and objective (acquisition of a density profile) evaluations were made after the stents were filled with a solution of 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and with a diluted contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to visualize the patent lumen in any of the stenotic stent segments by viewing at the CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After objective evaluation, the degree of the stenoses was generally overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with the 3.0-mm stents, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> ranged from 73.6 to 100% in 25% degree stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one stent, stenoses with a degree of more than 25% appeared as vessel obstruction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> = 100%) in the 3.0-mm group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 4.0-mm group, the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> was 60% for 25% degree stenoses, 76% for 50% degree stenoses, 91% for 75% degree stenoses and 96% for 95% degree stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The minimum diameter of stents for differentiation between in-stent restenosis and vessel occlusion using CT angiography is 4.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CT angiography, the degrees of in-stent stenoses are generally overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of in-stent restenoses only seems to be possible when CT angiographic images before and after contrast application are evaluated objectively by density profiles </plain></SENT>
