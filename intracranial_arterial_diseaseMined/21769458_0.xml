<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Concomitant intracranial and visceral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are a rare occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who underwent surgical repair of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> but subsequently experienced a ruptured hepatic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 59-year-old woman presented with a ruptured posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and was treated with coil occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 3, she became hypotensive with a rigid abdomen and was found to have a ruptured hepatic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid transfusion of packed red blood cells was begun, and the patient was taken to the angiography suite where the hepatic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was identified and successfully occluded using detachable coils to prevent further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recovery was complicated by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over several weeks, neurological status and third nerve <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> improved, with eventual discharge to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> rehabilitation center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent follow-up is notable for recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo>, and multiple strictures of right intrahepatic arteries and hepatic ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient is currently being evaluated for liver transplant, but continues to improve neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prior to this report, there have only been 2 documented cases of concomitant intracranial and visceral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These reports serve to remind the clinician that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> may be only part of a systemic pathology, which should be taken into account when unexpected complications arise postoperatively </plain></SENT>
