<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas it is known that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> worsen the outcome of spontaneous intracerebral haematomas, this has not been studied in non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a series of 13 non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> admitted to our department between January 1995 and March 2002, we had 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> associated haematomas and 3 haematomas corresponding to the syndrome of 'spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> of arterial origin' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Age and gender distribution were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> source was a cortical artery in 2 of the 2 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> related haematomas operated on, but also in 2 of the 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> associated haematomas that underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average haematoma thickness was higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> related haematomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score on admission was 7.7 and the mortality rate was 55.6% in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> related group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> related haematomas the mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score was 12.0 and the mortality rate 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter mortality rate corresponds well to that of a historical group of 'spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> of arterial origin' collected from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The outcome was worse in the non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> that were associated with a coagulation deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> the interval to surgery should be minimized, early recognition and urgent correction of coagulation deficiencies is certainly indicated </plain></SENT>
