<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated outcome in patients with intracranial occlusion after angioplasty and/or stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients who underwent angioplasty or stenting (17 stenting and 16 angioplasty) for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> during the past 5 years were enrolled from prospective neurointerventional database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared recanalization rate [defined as thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) grade II/III flow], adverse events, and clinical outcome [modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 1 and 6 months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tried to determine independent variables associated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was 13 and median time to treatment was 12 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The successful recanalization rate was mean 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 15% (5/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Events (27%, 9/33) at 1 month included four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, four major, and one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good outcome (mRS &lt;or= 2) was achieved in 17 patients (52%) at 6 months and was significantly related to age, initial NIHSS, TIMI flow, and stenting on bivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, stenting was the only variable significantly associated with a 6-month, good clinical outcome (OR, 14.48; 95% CI, 1.76 to 118.93; p = 0.013) CONCLUSION: Intracranial revascularization with angioplasty and/or stenting may improve the clinical outcome in selected patients with intracranial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple factors are related to favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
