<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Until now, clinical, noninvasive interrogation of intracranial vessels has consisted only of insonation via transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such devices have utilized a 2.0 MHz, continuous wave probe with Doppler spectral waveform display </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clincial aapplication of these techniques has required precise location of cranial "windows" and has been hampered by the extreme anatomic variability of both cranial bony structures and intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lack of simultaneous intracranial arterial visualization has limited the clinical pplicability of transcranial Doppler technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, the authors have utilized a 2.25 MHz curved phased array probe with a pulsed Doppler to image and insonate simultaneously the intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colorflow imaging of both near- and far-field regions is the necessary first step for vessel localization and identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once this is accomplished, the image of each artery in turn is amplified and gray scale tuning is employed to permit direct visualization of the arterial walls and lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulsed Doppler waveform analysis is perfomred simultaneously and along the entire visible artery length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this manner the arteries of both right and left hemispheres are examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have found the duplex technique to be superior to the use of Doppler alone in the examination on intracerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability to visualize and insonate simultaneously eliminates the uncertainty caused by anatomic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These advantages, long applied to the evaluation of peripheral vessels, are now available for use in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
