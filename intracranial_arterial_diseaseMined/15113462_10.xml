<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Most complications related to endovascular neurointerventional procedures are thromboembolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether abciximab, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitor, is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of thromboembolic complications encountered during interventional neuroradiological procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search of a prospectively maintained database identified 13 patients who were treated for intraprocedural thromboembolic complications with abciximab, either alone or in combination with tissue plasminogen activator, during a 22-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 13 patients in our series (10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>), 12 presented with unsecured vascular lesions, and in 9 cases the lesions were either acutely (&lt;10 d) or subacutely (&lt;6 mo) hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the identification of a thromboembolic complication, each patient was treated with either intra-arterial (n = 5) or intravenous (n = 8) abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abciximab was administered intravenously as a 0.25-mg/kg bolus (n = 2), a 0.25-mg/kg bolus followed by a 12-hour 0.125-microg/kg/min infusion (n = 5), or a 12-hour 0.125-microg/kg/min infusion alone (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial abciximab (3.5-10 mg) was administered directly through a microcatheter positioned in the vicinity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients also were administered alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete (n = 7) or partial (n = 6) resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the distribution of the thromboembolic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In no case was new or increased hemorrhaging observed after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abciximab (ReoPro), administered either intravenously or intra-arterially, is a viable option for the management of thromboembolic complications encountered during endovascular therapeutic procedures </plain></SENT>
