<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes related to thrombolytic treatment of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in a large national cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective database study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Nationwide Inpatient Sample data files from 2005 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We determined the frequency of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with thrombolytic treatment and associated in-hospital outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the in-hospital outcomes were analyzed after adjusting for potential confounders using multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 47,899 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who received thrombolytic treatment, 488 (1%) had an underlying dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> rates did not differ between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with or without underlying dissection who received thrombolytic treatment (6.9% vs 6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and hospital teaching status, presence of dissection was associated with higher rates of moderate disability (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-4.6; P &lt; .001) at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interaction terms between dissection and thrombolytic treatment among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for predicting in-hospital mortality (P = .84) and minimal disability (P = .13) were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The adjusted rate of favorable outcomes is lower among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> following thrombolytic treatment compared with those without underlying dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the observed lower rates are not influenced by thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
