<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABCD2 (Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) score and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities help to identify patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination on arrival at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinic yields additional information that facilitates the identification of patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2007, 1,881 patients were admitted to SOS-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinic (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinic with around-the-clock access) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and vascular assessment included TCD performed by a neurologist immediately after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> prevention measures were initiated on arrival, in accordance with guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed for 1 year after presentation to the SOS-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,823 TCD examinations were performed within 4 hours of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial narrowing or occlusion was found in 8.8% of patients, and was independently associated with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 1-year follow-up on best preventive therapy, the incidence of recurrent vascular events (intracranial revascularization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> recurrence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> combined) was 7.0% in patients with intracranial narrowing or occlusion and 2.4% in those without (log-rank, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio of combined outcome for the presence of intracranial narrowing or occlusion was 2.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.56; p = 0.02) in multivariate analysis including age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and was 2.50 (95%CI, 1.24-5.05; p = 0.01) in multivariate analysis including ABCD2 score &gt; or =4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Immediate TCD examination on arrival at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinic is feasible and could help to identify patients at high risk of vascular events recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study supports a systematic intracranial vascular examination in the initial management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
