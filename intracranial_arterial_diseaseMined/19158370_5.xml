<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial artery calcification (IAC) is frequently observed on brain computed tomography (CT) scans in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was designed to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical relevance of IAC in a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible patients admitted to Amiens University Hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between January and December 2006 and assessed using 64-slice multidetector-row CT (n = 340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the presence or absence of IAC in the internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, and basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFR was estimated using the MDRD equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) was defined as a GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied a control group of patients admitted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (76.2%) displayed IAC, which was independently associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> &gt; 50%, age, and GFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred three nonstroke patients (60.2%) had IAC, with age, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and GFR as independently associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients taken together, age, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and GFR were independently associated with IAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results confirm the high prevalence of IAC in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and show for the first time that IAC is associated with the presence of CKD in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IAC was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in nonstroke patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between IAC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
