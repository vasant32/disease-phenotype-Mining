<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report an autopsy case of segmental arterial mediolysis (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) of various phases occurring in both the intracranial vertebral artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>) and intra-abdominal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 70-year-old male found dead in his house </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was massive intra-abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> owing to a ruptured right gastroepiploic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination revealed that there was a broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> as long as 20 cm in the right gastroepiploic artery associated with <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> in the injurious phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> in the reparative phase was observed as organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> in the left gastric artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> in the reparative phase was detected as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e> undergoing an organizing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three lesions were considered to have developed at different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> occurring in both the intra-abdominal and intracranial vertebral arteries is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This coincidence may provide a clue to the relationship between <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> and spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e> dissection </plain></SENT>
