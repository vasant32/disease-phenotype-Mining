<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>VR and MIP images were compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume-rendered views improved the perceptibility of intracranial vasculature and consequently augmented diagnostic confidence, improved the characterization of underlying vascular pathologies, and facilitated image interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volume rendering has the potential to expand the role of cerebral MRA in the diagnostic investigation and treatment planning of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
