<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The limitations of the medical management of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> encourage the development of new therapeutic strategies such as intracranial stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report and analyze the results of a series of 42 patients treated with 3 different endovascular techniques: isolated angioplasty, balloon-expandable coronary stents, and the Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients presenting with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were treated with one of these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography angiography was performed 6 months after the procedure, and the clinical neurological statuses were categorized using the modified Rankin Scale and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42 lesions were treated: 9 with isolated angioplasty, 14 with balloon-expandable coronary stents, and 19 with Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 62.9 years, and the mean arterial diameter stenosis was 73.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 97.6% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of procedural complications was 21.4%, and the postoperative permanent morbidity/mortality rate was 7.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 3 cases of in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1 fatal) and 5 cases of asymptomatic restenosis (11.9%), 3 in the isolated angioplasty group and 2 in the Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stent group (mean follow-up 20.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of restenosis was higher in the angioplasty group (33%) than in the coronary (0%) and Wingspan stent (10.5%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis has significant overall morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the very critical natural history of severe refractory lesions and the relatively favorable postoperative evolution suggest that it should be considered the first alternative strategy in cases in which medical therapy has failed </plain></SENT>
