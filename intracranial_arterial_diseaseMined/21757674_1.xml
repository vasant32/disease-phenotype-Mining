<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional imaging methods cannot depict the vessel wall of intracranial arteries at sufficient resolutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hampers the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to develop a high-resolution MRI method to image intracranial vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a volumetric (3-dimensional) turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence for intracranial vessel wall imaging at 7.0-T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inversion recovery was used to null cerebrospinal fluid to increase contrast with the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetization preparation was applied before inversion to improve signal-to-noise ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven healthy volunteers and 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> underwent imaging to test the magnetization preparation inversion recovery TSE sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-based contrast agent (Gadobutrol, 0.1 mL/kg) was administered to assess possible lesion enhancement in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The walls of intracranial arterial vessels could be visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volunteers and patients with good contrast between wall, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The quality of the vessel wall depiction was independent of the vessel orientation relative to the plane of acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 21 of the 35 patients, a total number of 52 intracranial vessel wall lesions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 52 lesions showed enhancement after contrast administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 14 of the 52 lesions resulted in stenosis of the arterial lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial vessel wall and its pathology can be depicted with the magnetization preparation inversion recovery TSE sequence at 7.0 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The magnetization preparation inversion recovery TSE sequence will make it possible to study the role of intracranial arterial wall pathology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
