<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic efficacy of contrast-enhanced transcranial color-coded duplexsonography (TCCD) for noninvasive evaluation of the circle of Willis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with limited bone windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 171 consecutive patients who presented with ischemic symptoms in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory, 49 patients (32 female, 17 male; age range, 70.5+/-10.6 years) had no detectable colorflow signals from the circle of Willis by TCCD because of limited acoustic windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 49 patients received an IV injection of a sonographic contrast-enhancing agent, Levovist (Schering; Berlin, Germany), and were re-examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlative imaging studies of the circle of Willis were obtained in 42 of 49 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 38 of 49 patients, contrast-enhanced TCCD enabled full visualization of the circle of Willis bilaterally; in an additional five patients, contrast-enhanced TCCD revealed only the portion of the circle of Willis ipsilateral to the probe through one temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six of these 43 patients, contrast-enhanced TCCD showed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in three; three of the six cases of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were found on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six of 49 patients, no colorflow signals were obtained after contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> contrast-enhanced TCCD findings were confirmed by CT angiography, transfemoral digital subtraction angiography, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, or a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three correlative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levovist produced no serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-age patients with limited acoustic windows, contrast-enhancement with Levovist can markedly increase the sensitivity of TCCD and increase the detection of clinically relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
