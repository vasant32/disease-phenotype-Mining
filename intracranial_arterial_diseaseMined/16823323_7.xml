<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhagic complications were analyzed in 106 procedures of 99 patients treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) or stenting for intracranial arterial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were treated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stenting 106 times from January 1995 to December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients had intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 23 had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, and 19 had vertebrobasilar stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of hemodynamic compromise via single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was performed 50 times for 50 patients before the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hemorrhagic complications occurred in 106 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these cases involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stenting in the treated vascular territory 30 minutes and 16 hours after the treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which appeared 6 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic compromise was found on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography in these three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The last case with a hemorrhagic complication was a hemorrhagic infarction after recanalization of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which appeared 3 days after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyperperfusion syndrome was strongly suggested as the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the two cases associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of hemorrhagic complication directly related to the procedure of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stenting was 3%, and hyperperfusion syndrome was suggested as the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in two cases (2%), from the perspective of clinical characteristics and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic findings </plain></SENT>
