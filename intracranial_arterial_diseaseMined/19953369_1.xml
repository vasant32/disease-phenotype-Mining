<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We clarified the incidence of ICrAD in non-emergency outpatients complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> observed in case of ICrAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT POPULATION AND METHODS: Consecutive non-emergency outpatients coming to the neurological and neurosurgical departments and who underwent MRI and MRA examinations were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of ICrAD was made when patients met the following two conditions: (1) pearl-and-string sign, pearl sign, or string sign on MRA, and (2) high arterial wall signal on T1 images or intimal flap on T2 images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If possible, cerebral angiography and/or black blood MRI and/or surface-image MRI was also performed in cases meeting these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> group (172 patients): severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was seen in five patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> was diagnosed in eight patients (4.7%, including seven cases of asymptomatic vertebral dissection and one of basilar dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> noted in most cases of ICrAD was similar to that experienced in daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) Non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group (201 patients): complaints included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>/dizziness in 52 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> in 28, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the arm or leg in 20, and limb numbness in 18, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> attack in 14, and others in 69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo> was diagnosed in six patients (3.0%, including one case of asymptomatic basilar and two of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e>, symptomatic two vertebral and one basilar dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We obtained no evidence of significant difference in the incidence of ICrAD in non-emergency outpatients with (4.7%) and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in the cases of ICrAD was similar to that experienced in daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ICrAD with nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is more common than previously thought </plain></SENT>
