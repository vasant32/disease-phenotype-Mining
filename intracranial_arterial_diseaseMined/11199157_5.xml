<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports of such anomalies in the canine brain are scarce, and their classification is confusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case series of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> from the brains of five dogs was characterized using histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, in addition to gross and microscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> were located in the telencephalon, three in the pyriform lobe, without any predilection for the left or right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartoma</z:hpo> consisted of a proliferation of thin-walled vessels which varied in caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These vessels were elastin-negative, with varying amounts of collagen and no muscular component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four of the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo>, lining cells were actin- and factor VIII-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> contained glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive parenchyma at moderate to high frequency, and four contained neurofilament-positive axons between component vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report shows that vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> in the canine brain are structural malformations for which immunohistochemistry is useful for accurate classification </plain></SENT>
