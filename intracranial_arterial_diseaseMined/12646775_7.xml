<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CE) has been shown to be beneficial in patients with symptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some authors have suggested that when ultrasound shows a stenosis 70-99%, CE can be performed without further imaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, ultrasound findings that suggest an ICA occlusion, not confirmed by angiography but which instead show a near-occlusion usually benefit from CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study are: (1). to evaluate how angiography-obtained information on intracranial arteries affects the treatment decision in patients with 70-99% ICA stenosis, and (2). to evaluate when a symptomatic ICA occlusion shown by ultrasound could actually be a patent artery and therefore benefit from CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected the cerebral angiograms of 133 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or non-disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to large artery disease where ultrasound suggested a stenosis &gt;or=70% or occlusion of symptomatic ICA; we calculated the frequency of intracranial vascular malformations and intracranial artery disease (IAD) located in the infraclinoid or supraclinoid portion of the ICA, and in the anterior or middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound showed 31 ICA occlusions and 102 ICA with 70-99% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with an ICA stenosis 70-99% on ultrasound examination had the degree of stenosis confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two out of 31 patients did not have a complete occlusion but angiography showed a near-occlusion and consequently they underwent CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five (62.5%) out of 104 patients with patent ICA had IAD (mild 26.9%, moderate 21.2%, and severe 14.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (4.8%) had intracranial vascular malformations (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (6.7%) did not undergo CE after angiography (1 patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> &gt;10 mm, 1 patient had a very tight stenosis of the basilar artery, 5 patients had intracranial stenosis more severe than the extracranial stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients that on the basis of ultrasound examination can benefit from CE, information on intracranial arteries is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, complete occlusion cannot be detected with certainty only by ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
