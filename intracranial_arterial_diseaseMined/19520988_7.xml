<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and ABCD(2) score &gt; or =4 and those with &gt;2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> within 1 week be admitted for urgent complete etiologic evaluation within 24 hours and that those with an ABCD(2) score &lt;4 be evaluated less urgently within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from 1176 patients with a definite or possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> included in the SOS-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> registry (January 2003 to June 2007), we studied the usefulness of the conventional ABCD(2) score cutoff as well as the NICE criteria for urgent admission to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit defined as presence of symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =50%, symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =50%, or major cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 697 patients with an ABCD(2) score &lt;4, 20% required immediate consideration for emergency treatment (eg, symptomatic internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt; or =50% in 9.1% of patients, symptomatic intracranial stenosis in 5.0%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 5.9%, other major cardiac source of embolism in 2.1%) in comparison to 31.6% of 497 patients with an ABCD(2) score &gt; or =4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of ABCD(2) score &gt; or =4 or NICE criteria for discriminating between patients requiring admission or not were &lt;62% with low positive predictive values (&lt;30%) and high negative predictive values (&gt; or =80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One in 5 patients with an ABCD(2) score &lt;4 had high-risk disease requiring urgent treatment decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When triaging on an ABCD(2) score, we recommend adding systematic carotid ultrasound (or a default angiographic CT scan) and electrocardiography within 24 hours before postponing complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> evaluation </plain></SENT>
