<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes our recent experience with two patients who presented with symptoms ipsilateral to a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> at the bifurcation, with one having a severe stenosis at the siphon and the other an occlusion of the internal carotid artery in its intracranial portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions were documented on preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both instances, persistence of symptoms, despite maximal medical therapy, led us to proceed with carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, intraoperative angiography confirmed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial internal carotid artery, contrary to what had been seen on preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy was performed, with resolution of clinical symptoms in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This experience suggests that the appearance of the intracranial portion of the carotid artery can be significantly affected by the presence of a proximal lesion at the bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenosis and/or occlusion of the intracranial portion of the carotid artery may appear on preoperative angiography secondary to flow alterations as a result of the more proximal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This, in part, may explain why many patients with combined extracranial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> improve after carotid endarterectomy and suggests that, in the presence of a severe extracranial lesion, further evaluation be undertaken to exclude the possibility of pseudo-stenosis or pseudo-occlusion of the intracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
