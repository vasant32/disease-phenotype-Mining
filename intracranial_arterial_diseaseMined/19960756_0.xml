<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are usually associated with venous anomalies or in few cases with both arterial and venous anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six year old female presented with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> associated with pure <z:mp ids='MP_0002191'>arterial dysplasia</z:mp> in the absence of any associated venous anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal arterial supply to or an abnormal venous drainage from the growing cortex may result in cortical rearrangements that eventually give rise to various neuronal migration anomalies </plain></SENT>
