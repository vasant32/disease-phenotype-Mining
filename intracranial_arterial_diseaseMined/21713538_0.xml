<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have explored its association with cerebral arteriographic changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explored the relation of TCD changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> cerebral arteriography and clinical outcome in Omani population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 4 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were subjected to TCD through the temporal and suboccipital windows using a 2 MHz probe; flow velocities, pulsatility and direction of flow were recorded from arteries at the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> arteriographic (MRA) changes on corresponding arteries were graded on a scale of 1-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA, student's t test and ROC analysis were used to evaluate TCD in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type, outcome and stenosis on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 60 patients recruited, 52 (M:F::36:16; mean age: 60 + 13 years) had adequate bone window for TCD study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 30 (58%) patients; lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-11 (21%); cardioembolic and mixed groups 9 (17%), other specificed causes-2 (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>86.5% had evidence of intracranial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>10/52 patients (19%) died while 33 (63%) had good outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 186 arteries studied by the two methods, 52 had TCD evidence of stenosis while 42 were abnormal on MRA, giving a sensitivity of 60%, specificity: 81.25%; positive likelihood ratio: 3.18 and negative likelihood ratio: 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>29/52 (56%) of patients had TCD changes in the arteries corresponding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal TCD was associated with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (p = 0.007), poor outcome (p = 0.038) and mortality (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study of TCD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Omani population demonstrates a relatively higher burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TCD changes are associated with type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and outcome in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TCD is a simple and fairly useful method of evaluation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Adopting TCD in evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may provide useful information regarding the pathophysiology which could enhance patient management </plain></SENT>
