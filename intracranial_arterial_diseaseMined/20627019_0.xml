<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By cluster sampling, 1405 adult Han people were selected from the residential communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 1035 people conformed to the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history was documented and body height, body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and blood pressure were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples were collected to detect the serum concentrations of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) level was determined by <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> reduction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (MCAS) was diagnosed by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SPSS 11.0 software package was used for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was found in 66 subjects (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were the risk factors for MCAS and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was a risk factor only in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression demonstrated history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was an independent risk factor for MCAS both in males and females (P = 0.011, P = 0.009) and WHR for MCAS only in males (P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among males and females over 55 years old, the NO levels were higher in people with a higher WHR and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.042, P = 0.016); however the NO levels for people with a varying WHR showed statistically insignificant difference among females under 55 years old (P = 0.228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are important risk factors for MCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell dysfunction and an elevated level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be involved in the atherogenetic mechanism of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> may play a protective role in it </plain></SENT>
