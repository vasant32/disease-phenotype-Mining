<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefit of obtaining additional clinically relevant information must be weighed against the detriment of increased cost, delaying time to treatment, and adverse events such as contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Use of National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score to predict a proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (PO) is suggested by several case series as a viable method of selecting cases appropriate for multimodal imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred ninety-nine patients enrolled in a prospective cohort study involving CT angiographic imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were dichotomized according to the presence of a PO, including a subgroup of 177 subjects with middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median NIHSS score of patients found to have a PO was higher than the overall median (9 versus 5, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS score of patients with middle cerebral artery M1 occlusion was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NIHSS score &gt; or =10 had 81% positive predictive value for PO but only 48% sensitivity with the majority of subjects with PO presenting with lower NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with NIHSS score &gt; or =2 would need to undergo angiographic imaging to detect 90% of PO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High NIHSS score correlates with the presence of a proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No NIHSS score threshold can be applied to select a subgroup of patients for angiographic imaging without failing to capture the majority of cases with clinically important occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of minimal clinical deficits should not deter urgent angiographic imaging in otherwise appropriate patients suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
