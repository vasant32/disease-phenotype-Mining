<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antithrombotic therapy for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> was recently evaluated in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> versus Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prespecified aim of WASID was to identify patients at highest risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic artery who would be the target group for a subsequent trial comparing intracranial stenting with medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: WASID was a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter trial involving 569 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to 50% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median time from qualifying event to randomization was 17 days, and mean follow-up was 1.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 106 patients (19.0%); 77 (73%) of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were in the territory of the stenotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic artery was highest with severe stenosis &gt; or =70% (hazard ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 3.22; P=0.0025) and in patients enrolled early (&lt; or =17 days) after the qualifying event (hazard ratio 1.69; 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.72; P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women were also at increased risk, although this was of borderline significance (hazard ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 2.55; P=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Location of stenosis, type of qualifying event, and prior use of antithrombotic medications were not associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis, the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic artery is greatest with stenosis &gt; or =70%, after recent symptoms, and in women </plain></SENT>
