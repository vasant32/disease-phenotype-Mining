<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) and intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD) has been described, but only in cohorts of ethnic Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of MetS and ICLAD among ethnic Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective study of consecutive ethnic Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> living in Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICLAD was diagnosed on transcranial color-coded Doppler or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 135 patients studied, the frequency of MetS was higher among patients with ICLAD (39% v 16%, P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = .003), and individual MetS criteria (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ICLAD positively correlated with the number of MetS criteria fulfilled (P = .021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of an association between MetS and ICLAD among ethnic Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> concur with findings among ethnic Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This validation provides a basis for further investigation into the pathophysiologic link between MetS and ICLAD </plain></SENT>
