<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in intracranial large-artery occlusive disease is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relationship between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the risk of further ischemic events in first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 127 consecutive first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial stenoses detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, 71 fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion criteria, which included angiographic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum high-sensitivity CRP level was determined a minimum of 3 months after the qualifying event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up during 1 year after blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients (18.3%) with intracranial large-artery occlusive disease experienced an end point event: 9 cerebral ischemic events, 7 of which were attributable to intracranial large-artery occlusive disease, and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest quintile of high-sensitivity CRP level had a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio for new events compared with those in the first quintile (odds ratio, 8.66; 95% CI, 1.39 to 53.84; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high-sensitivity CRP level above the receiver operating characteristic curve cutoff value of 1.41 mg/dL emerged as an independent predictor of new end point events (hazard ratio, 7.14; 95% CI, 1.77 to 28.73; P=0.005) and of further intracranial large-artery occlusive disease-related ischemic events (hazard ratio, 30.67; 95% CI, 3.6 to 255.5; P=0.0015), after adjustment for age, sex, and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves showed that a significantly lower proportion of patients with a high-sensitivity CRP &gt;1.41 mg/dL remained free of a new ischemic event (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-sensitivity CRP serum level predicts further intracranial large-artery occlusive disease-related and any major ischemic events in patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may be involved in the progression and complication of intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
