<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients undergoing scheduled OPCAB were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the results of their magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and cervical ultrasonography: 13 patients had cervical or intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (Group A), and 21 patients did not (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from the arterial catheters immediately before surgery, upon arrival to the intensive care unit, and 6 and 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In blood samples collected from patients upon arrival to the intensive care unit, the maximum concentration of serum s-100β protein in Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though patients in Group A tended to have higher maximum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentrations, there were no significant differences in NSE concentrations at any point between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a correlation between the stenosis detected by MRA or cervical ultrasonography and brain damage after OPCAB </plain></SENT>
