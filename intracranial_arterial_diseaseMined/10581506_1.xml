<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work investigated whether turbo magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can replace conventional MRA in screening examination of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phantom was used to evaluate the effect of the zero-filling interpolation (ZFI) technique on spatial resolution and partial volume effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one consecutive patients underwent both turbo MRA with a slice thickness of 0.7 mm (data were measured as 1.33 mm sections) and conventional MRA with 1.0 mm sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the phantom studies, ZFI did not improve the spatial resolution, but the partial volume effect was somewhat reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clinical evaluation, turbo MRA showed better signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of the intracranial major vessels than conventional MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> less than 3 mm in diameter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> depicted on both turbo MRA and conventional MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Turbo MRA is a useful screening procedure because of its capability of delineating lesions in approximately half the usual imaging time </plain></SENT>
