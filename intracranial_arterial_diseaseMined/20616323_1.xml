<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the vascular risk factors and demographic features associated with the severity and location of intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial were used for the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic features and vascular risk factors were compared in patients with moderate stenosis (n=336) versus severe stenosis (n=225) and according to the location of intracranial stenosis (middle cerebral, internal carotid, basilar, or vertebral artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: History of a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorder (77% in severe vs 67% in moderate, P=0.01), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (63% in severe vs 53% in moderate, P=0.05), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (43% in severe vs 35% in moderate, P=0.04) were more common in patients with severe intracranial stenosis by univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A history of a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorder was independently associated with severe stenosis (odds ratio=1.62; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.42; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of stenosis location differed among age groups (P=0.0015), sexes (P=0.0001), races (P=0.0243), qualifying events (P=0.0156), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P=0.0030), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P=0.0030), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (P=0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery stenoses</z:e> were older and more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with middle cerebral artery stenoses were more likely to be women and black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> were more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265103" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery stenoses</z:e> were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: History of a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorder had the strongest association with severity of intracranial stenosis and should be the target of prevention therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Different locations of intracranial stenoses are associated with different vascular risk factors and demographic features, suggesting that there may be a difference in the underlying pathophysiology of stenoses among the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
