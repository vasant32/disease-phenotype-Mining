<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We routinely perform an urgent bedside neurovascular ultrasound examination (NVUE) with carotid/vertebral duplex and transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the yield and accuracy of NVUE to identify lesions amenable for interventional treatment (LAITs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NVUE was performed with portable carotid duplex and TCD using standardized fast-track (&lt;15 minutes) insonation protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was the gold standard for identifying LAIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These lesions were defined as proximal intra- or extracranial occlusions, near-occlusions, &gt; or =50% stenoses or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the symptomatic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients (70 women, mean age 66+/-15 years) underwent NVUE at median 128 minutes after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients (36%) received intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis (median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score 14, range 4 to 29; 81% had NIHSS &gt; or =10 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NVUE demonstrated LAITs in 98% of patients eligible for thrombolysis, 76% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients ineligible for thrombolysis (n=63), and 42% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=33), P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urgent DSA was performed in 30 patients on average 230 minutes after NVUE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with DSA, NVUE predicted LAIT presence with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, although individual accuracy parameters for TCD and carotid duplex specific to occlusion location ranged 75% to 96% because of the presence of tandem lesions and 10% rate of no temporal windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bedside neurovascular ultrasound examination, combining carotid/vertebral duplex with TCD yields a substantial proportion of LAITs in excellent agreement with urgent DSA </plain></SENT>
