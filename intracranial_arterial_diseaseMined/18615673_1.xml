<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of positive MESs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> using power M-mode Doppler (PMD) sonography and also tested the feasibility of this new technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-three consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> patients with intracranial large artery occlusive disease were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMD/TCD monitoring for 30 minutes was used for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection downstream of the stenotic artery within 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical risk factors in emboli-positive and emboli-negative patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MESs were detected in 21% (7/33) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in clinical risk factors between emboli-positive and emboli-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PMD sonography to detect MESs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is feasible and may be used in future clinical trials regarding <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection </plain></SENT>
