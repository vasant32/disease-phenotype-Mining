<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> are increasingly found in mass screenings using MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to assess the usefulness of two non-invasive clinical tests-carotid ultrasound examination and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) measurement-for predicting silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (SCI) and silent intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on 480 asymptomatic adult subjects who participated in a brain screening program at a single hospital between April 2003 and March 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent baPWV measurement, B-mode ultrasonography of carotid arteries, MRI, and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on 476 (99.1%) subjects were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, 273 (57.4%) were male and the mean age was 51.5 years; 161 (33.8%) had carotid plaque; 33 (6.9%) had increased intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>); 99 (20.8%) had SCI; and 7 (1.5%) had intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.17), carotid plaque (OR: 2.69; 1.59-4.56), increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (OR: 2.40; 1.02-5.65), and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treatment (OR 2.22; 1.11-4.43) were significantly associated with SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (OR 9.70: 1.48-63.71) was related to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brachial-ankle PWV was related to SCI (p&lt;0.01) and intracranial stenosis (p=0.01) in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of carotid plaque and that of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> on ultrasound examination are useful for assessing the risk of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is also predictive of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
