<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anecdotal reports exist on SS being associated with a humoral immune response against endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no original data has ever been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze serum and CSF from a patient with SS for the presence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> auto-antibodies and, if present, to further characterize such antibodies immunologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum and CSF samples were examined by indirect immunofluorescence on adult mouse cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and inner ear tissue sections, and IgG subclasses were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-endothelial antibodies were found at a titre of 1:960 in serum but not CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies belonged to the complement activating IgG1 subclass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">Glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a decrease of titres (1:480), though the antibodies remained clearly detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our finding of anti-endothelial cell antibodies in a patient with SS is important in the light of previous pathological data suggesting that SS is associated with endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger serological studies are now warranted to assess systematically the frequency and relevance of auto-antibodies in SS </plain></SENT>
