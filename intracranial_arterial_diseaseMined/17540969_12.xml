<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are limited and conflicting data on gender differences in clinical outcomes among patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined gender differences in patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were 569 men and women with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were followed-up for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from February 1999 through July 2003 (mean follow-up, 1.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-year rates of the primary end point were 28.4% and 16.6% for women and men, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative probabilities of the outcomes over time were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and were compared between men and women with the use of the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio of gender (women to men) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and for the primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.005) and of the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P=0.017) over time were significantly higher in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women had a greater multivariate-adjusted risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.01; P=0.013) and for the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.48; P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> are at significantly greater risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and for the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the need for vigorous screening of risk factors and for aggressive management of risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They also suggest the need to ensure adequate numbers of women in clinical trials designed to explore new and promising therapies for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
