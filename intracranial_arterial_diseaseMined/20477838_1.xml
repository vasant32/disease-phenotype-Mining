<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Clinical and neuroimaging (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and follow-up) findings were analysed prospectively in 79 children (48 males, 31 females) aged 2 months to 15 years 8 months (median 5 y 3 mo) at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by the Swiss Neuropaediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry from 2000 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was confirmed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period in 36 out of 41 children who underwent computed tomography, in 53 of 57 who underwent T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 48 children who underwent diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIS occurred in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 63 participants and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was associated with lesions of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion was cortical-subcortical in 30 out of 63 children, cortical in 25 out of 63, and subcortical in 8 of 63 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among participants with AIS in the posterior circulation territory, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was cortical-subcortical in 8 out of 16, cortical in 5 of 16, and thalamic in 3 out of 16 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: AIS mainly involves the anterior circulation territory, with both the ACA and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> being affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The classification of Ganesan is an appropriate population-based classification for our Swiss cohort, but the neuroimaging pattern alone is insufficient to determine the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a paediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show a poor correlation between lesion pattern and aetiology </plain></SENT>
