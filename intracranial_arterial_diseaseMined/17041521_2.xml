<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging has been used extensively in coronary artery interventions and has provided invaluable information for the understanding and treatment of coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here the first description, to our knowledge, of IVUS-guided intracranial arterial interventions in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients underwent intracranial angioplasty and stent placement with the assistance of IVUS for the evaluation of their lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent stenting to treat an occlusive dissection of the left internal carotid artery that occurred during <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another patient underwent angioplasty and stenting for high-grade restenosis of a basilar artery atherosclerotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients underwent successful revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient with the dissection had a small intraventricular and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> documented by computed tomography 4 hours after treatment, but did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients did well clinically and had no permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IVUS provided important information in terms of lesion evaluation, stent selection, and stent placement in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IVUS of the intracranial circulation may assist the performance of intracranial angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It provides useful information that can affect clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may prove to be a valuable tool in clinical use and enhance our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> of the intracranial circulation, as it has in the coronary circulation </plain></SENT>
