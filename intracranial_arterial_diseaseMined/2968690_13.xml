<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The utility of this instrument becomes more apparent as it is used in different clinical settings and compared with angiographic findings (Figures 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its importance in early detection of vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is now clearly known; increased flow velocity can be documented prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> and thus allow early institution of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> of unclear etiology, especially in blacks, Orientals, or females, who have a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e>, TCD can be a very important noninvasive means for detecting stenosis of intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its value for assessing collateral circulation, intraoperative monitoring, and measuring CBF is quite promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, through further work with TCD, we will be able to clarify the spectrum of its usages as well as its limitations, though the preliminary data indicate that it should be an important addition to present noninvasive evaluations </plain></SENT>
