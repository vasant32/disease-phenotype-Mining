<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To access the safety of low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in comparison to a high-dose regimen in patients undergoing intracranial stent-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients (53 men; mean age 54 years) undergoing stent-assisted angioplasty of 70 intracranial arterial stenoses were randomized to receive either low-dose (2000-U bolus+500 U/h) or high-dose (3000-U bolus+800 U/h) intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activated clotting time (ACT) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared for the following primary endpoints until hospital discharge: target lesion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall angioplasty success rate was 93% (65/70 lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stents were placed in 94.7% (36/38) and 90.6% (29/32) of patients in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively (p = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint occurred in 6% (2/33) of patients in the low-dose group versus 16% (5/31) of patients in the high-dose group (p = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients, 1 patient in each group, experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> target lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during the procedure (p = NS); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> occurred in 5 patients: 1 in the low-dose group and 4 in high-dose group (3.0% versus 12.9%, p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of a low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> regimen did not increase the incidence of target lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in this small pilot trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> seems to be safe for patients undergoing intracranial stent-assisted angioplasty, but these data should be confirmed in a larger trial </plain></SENT>
