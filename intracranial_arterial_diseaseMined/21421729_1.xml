<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to compare central <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor binding potential (BRBP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) images on SPECT with OEF images on PET in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OEF, CBF, and BRBP were assessed using (15)O PET and N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-(123)I-iodoamphetamine and (123)I-iomazenil SPECT, respectively, in 20 healthy subjects and in 34 patients with unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were transformed into the standard brain size and shape by linear and nonlinear transformation using statistical parametric mapping for anatomic standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region of interest (ROI) was automatically placed according to the arterial supply using a 3-dimensional stereotactic ROI template, and the ratio of the value in the affected side to that in the contralateral side was calculated in each image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with occlusive disease, a significant positive correlation was observed between PET OEF and SPECT BRBP/CBF ratios in 3 cerebral cortical regions (r = 0.851, P &lt; 0.0001, for anterior cerebral artery [ACA] ROI; r = 0.807, P &lt; 0.0001, for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ROI; and r = 0.774, P &lt; 0.0001, for posterior cerebral artery [<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>] ROI), but there were no correlations between these 2 parameters in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When an abnormally elevated PET OEF ratio was defined as a value greater than the mean + 2 SDs obtained in healthy subjects, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100% and 96% for the ACA ROI, 100% and 89% for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ROI, and 100% and 93% for the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> ROI for the SPECT BRBP/CBF ratio for detecting an abnormally elevated PET OEF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BRBP/CBF images on SPECT correlate with OEF images on PET in a specific clinical setting-that is, in the cerebral cortex of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ICA occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
