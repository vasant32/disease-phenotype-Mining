<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast angiography (CA) is the reference examination for the diagnosis of cerebral arterial abnormality, but this procedure is invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In childhood, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> are being increasingly investigated by means of MRI, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very few data are available about the accuracy of MRA compared with CA in the specific context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare the results of MRA with those of CA for the study of cerebral arteries in children with arterial infarction in an arterial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four children presenting with 26 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were examined with cerebral MRI and MRA and with CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interval between CA and MRA was &lt;3 days for most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial lesions were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were located in the major cerebral arteries, predominantly in the anterior circulation (85% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions shown by CA were present on MRA (19 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with no lesion on MRA had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CA (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Associated distal vascular lesions and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were more accurately detected with CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRA is sensitive enough to provide an adequate initial evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752137" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial brain disease</z:e> in childhood </plain></SENT>
