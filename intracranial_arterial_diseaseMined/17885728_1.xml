<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed to assess whether the occurrence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> is a risk factor for poor outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> and cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical relevance of intracranial arterial stenoses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> and cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> was studied using transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) over the period of 1 year (2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made between patients with and those without intracranial arterial stenoses during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: There were 12 males and three females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (27%, 4/15) exhibited a stenosis of at least one cerebral artery, of which three had bilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis and one had unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stenoses were demonstrable during the whole observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months of follow-up, fatality rate was 50% (2/4) in those with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and 9% (1/11) in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of poor outcome at a 6-month endpoint had an odds ratio of 5.3 for patients with intracranial arterial stenoses than those without (reference group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial arterial stenoses imply danger of cerebrovascular complications for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the frequency of intracranial stenosis in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> is high (27%) and it may be associated with poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
