<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions are common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of these new lesions is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We differentiated new DWI lesions outside the area of initial hypoperfusion from those confined to the area of initial hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent 3 MRI examinations: on admission, on the next day, and 4 to 7 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if a perfusion deficit was present on the initial scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions on DWI images were delineated manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coregistered DWI images were analyzed visually for new hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In reference to the perfusion maps (mean transit time), patients were classified as having "outside lesions" if new DWI lesions were outside or both outside and inside the area of the initial perfusion deficit or "inside lesions" if new DWI lesions were completely inside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 164 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients (23%) had outside lesions and 34 patients (21%) had inside lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariable regression analysis, new outside lesions were significantly associated with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, multiple index lesions pattern, and high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New inside lesions were significantly associated with (spontaneous or thrombolytic) vessel recanalization, multiple index lesions pattern, and low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Outside and inside lesions represent different pathophysiological entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More specifically patients with outside lesions may have an increased risk for subsequent cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
