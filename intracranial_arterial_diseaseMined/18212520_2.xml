<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the influence that steno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005315'>occlusive arterial disease</z:hpo> may have on the development of early neurological deterioration (END) in a large series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a prospective cohort of 1,093 patients admitted to a single tertiary hospital with presence of neurological symptoms in the first 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>END was defined as any increase in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &gt;or=4 points in the first 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arterial study assessed the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> or significative stenosis in the symptomatic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, age, initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, vascular risk factors, lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and prior use of antithrombotic treatment were also analyzed in a multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: END was detected in 179 patients (16.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Steno-occlusive disease (adjusted OR 3.60), initial blood pressure and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were independently associated with END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (adjusted OR 2.33) or occlusions (adjusted OR 3.65) were associated with END </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The higher adjusted OR (5.49) was obtained for steno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005315'>occlusive arterial disease</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An early arterial study may provide key data for the selection of patients with higher risk of END after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
