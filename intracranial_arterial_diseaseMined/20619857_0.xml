<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dissections involving intracranial arteries are sometimes difficult to assess using conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the value of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) for the assessment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> (ICADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 39 patients (26 males, 13 females; average age 50+/-15years) who were diagnosed as having ICADs and who underwent both DSA and 3D-RA in our hospital between April 1999 and March 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared 3D-RA images to conventional DSA images in a blinded manner with respect to double lumen sign, pearl and string sign, string sign, and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the caliber size of the artery affected by dissections, we divided patients into two groups: smaller artery group (S group) and larger artery group (L group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection rate of double lumen sign with 3D-RA (79%) was significantly higher than with conventional DSA (18%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reliable findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> (double lumen sign and/or pearl and string sign) were observed more often with 3D-RA (90%) than with conventional DSA (36%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In S group, the double lumen sign was detected only with 3D-RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 3D-RA allows increased conspicuity of ICADs findings with conventional DSA, especially in smaller-caliber intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
