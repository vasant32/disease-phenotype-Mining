<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 231 consecutive inpatients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with the history of cerebrovascular diseases and relevant neurological symptoms were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;50% diameter reduction) was detected using CT angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 231 patients, 69 (29.87%) had intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common stenosis site is middle cerebral artery (43.69%), followed by carotid siphon (20.39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stenosis in internal carotid arterial system (78.64%) was more common than in vertebrobasilar arterial system (21.56%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> were older, had longer history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, higher levels of systolic blood pressure, higher plasma cholesterol, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lp (a), higher urinary microalbumin excretion, thicker ventricular septum, and lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> than the patients without stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic analysis showed that systolic blood pressure (OR 1.650, 95% CI 1.134 - 2.400, P = 0.023), course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 1.238, 95% CI 1.072 - 1.429, P = 0.006), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (OR 2.103, 95% CI 1.157 - 3.823, P = 0.014) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.325, 95% CI 1.161 - 4.341, P = 0.011) were the independent risk factors of asymptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 30% inpatients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had asymptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common site of stenosis was middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were risk factors for the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
