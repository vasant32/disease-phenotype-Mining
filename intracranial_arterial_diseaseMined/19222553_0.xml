<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD) is a common site of disease among ethnic Asians, and carries a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of ICLAD among ethnic Asian patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited patients with AD and VaD from a retrospective review of consecutive ethnic Asian patients presenting to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICLAD was evaluated by visual inspection of brain magnetic resonance angiography by two observers in consensus, and defined as &gt;50% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 56 patients with probable AD and 47 with probable VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICLAD was prevalent among 53% of VaD patients and 18% of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a relatively high burden of ICLAD among AD and VaD patients of Asian ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ethnic Asian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients are a potential group to investigate if ICLAD is associated with clinical symptoms or prognosis and if treatment strategies targeted at ICLAD retard the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
