<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify a simple indicator on B mode images for M1 evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with an intact M1 segment underwent prospective TCCS evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visibilities of the contralateral temporal bone (CTB), midbrain (MB) and lesser sphenoid wing (LSW) on B mode images were defined as follows: 'invisible', 'poor' if the contour was less than 50% visible, 'fair' if more than 50% visible and 'good' if totally visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>M1 detectability on color Doppler images was defined as follows: 'INVISIBLE', 'POOR' if the M1 was detected as color dots, 'FAIR' if linearly but discontinuously detectable, and 'GOOD' if linearly and continuously detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between each structure's visibility and M1 detectability was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with 152 TBWs were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CTB was 'invisible' in 2%, 'poor' in 22%, 'fair' in 36% and 'good' in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visibility of the MB was 36, 24, 26 and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visibility of the LSW was 16, 22, 29 and 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The M1 was 'INVISIBLE' in 51%, 'POOR' in 7%, 'FAIR' in 7% and 'GOOD' in 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between each structure's visibility and M1 detectability was 0.68 for the CTB, 0.66 for the MB and 0.80 for the LSW, respectively (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Visibility of the LSW on B mode appears to be a better indicator than other structures for M1 evaluation </plain></SENT>
