<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To ensure the safety of salvaged blood in neurologic surgery, reinfused blood through the Cell Saver System (CSS) (Hemonetics) was investigated cytologically and bacteriologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specimens of reinfused blood were cytologically examined with Papanicolaou or Giemsa stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reinfused blood and air in the operating theater were investigated by microbiologic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of dust particles in the theater was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells were positive in reinfused blood in 5 of 9 specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo>, in 2 of 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenoma</z:hpo>, and 1 of 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of migration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> cells into reinfused blood was significantly low in comparison with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 specimens studied microbiologically, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> growth was detected in salvaged blood of 14 specimens (46.7%) and in the air of the operating theater for 8 specimens (26.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In craniotomy, the contamination rate was 10 of 26 specimens of reinfused blood (38.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most microorganisms were found to be staphylococci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation could be found between salvaged blood and air as to contamination or between reinfused blood and the concentration of dust particles in the theater as to bacteriologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No infectious complications were found after the operation, though salvaged blood through the CSS was reinfused in 37 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> or transsphenoidal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CSS cannot always entrap <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Salvaged blood should not be reinfused in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> or transsphenoidal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with reinfusion had any infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reinfusion of salvaged blood seems to be safe in neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
