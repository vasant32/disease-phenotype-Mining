<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the factors associated with IAC and its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 490 head computed tomographic scans from 2225 hemodialysis patients presenting with neurological symptoms at our center (October 2005-May 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> was graded using a validated scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression was used to examine the factors associated with the presence of IAC, its severity, and its ability to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weibull's survival models analyzed the relationship between IAC severity and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had IAC vs. 83% in the nonstroke group (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> severity increased with age (P&lt;0.001), hemodialysis vintage (P&lt;0.001), serum phosphate (P&lt;0.05), and major comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with multiple computed tomographic scans during the study period, increased IAC severity at baseline was predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.05) on logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-grade and not low-grade IAC was associated with worse survival (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcification</z:hpo> is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients, especially in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its severity is prognostically significant and associated with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> and may confer a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in this patient group require further comprehensive study </plain></SENT>
