<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Noninvasive neuroimaging techniques are increasingly identifying unruptured intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> (IADs) at examination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 3% of cases of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) are caused by IADs in Japan, but the natural history of unruptured IADs is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data obtained in 190 patients with 206 IADs were retrospectively analyzed on the basis of long-time follow-up of geometry and clinical event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IADs were divided into an unruptured group and SAH group depending on the patient's clinical status at the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Day 0 was defined as the day preceding diagnosis of IAD-that is, the day of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was retrospectively determined from the clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 206 IADs included 98 unruptured lesions and 108 SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the vertebral artery was the most frequent site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the unruptured group, 93 IADs were followed for a mean of 3.44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (Day 0) and neuroimaging diagnosis was 9.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent geometry change was seen in 78 (83.9%) of 93 IADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major change was almost completed within 2 months, and complete normalization was seen on neuroimaging in 17 (18.3%) of 93 IADs, with the earliest on Day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the IAD in the unruptured group occurred in only 1 patient on Day 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, 84 of the 108 patients complained of preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 81 (96.4%) of the 84 patients, SAH occurred on Day 0-3 with the latest on Day 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the unruptured and SAH groups, the latest day of SAH from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was Day 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most IADs causing SAH bleed within a few days of occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most IADs that are unruptured already have little risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at diagnosis because of the repair process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> may be much more common than previously thought, and the majority may occur and heal without symptom manifestation </plain></SENT>
