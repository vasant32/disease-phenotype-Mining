<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The major interest in vertebral artery (VA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> comes from its possible connection to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraines with aura</z:hpo> as well as from the fact that it is one of the risk factors for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, color Doppler of VA was performed in 64 first- and second-degree relatives of 33 probands, and the presence of VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was confirmed according to the already established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since a higher prevalence of VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (15.6%) in probands'relatives in comparison with 2.34% in the general population of Croatia was indicative of a strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> for this condition, an analysis of family data by means of Pearson's chi-square statistics has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, the observed sex-specific frequencies of 36 parent-offspring pairs composed only of affected parent and his/her (affected or non-affected) offspring are compared to the frequencies as expected under eight proposed models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both--autosomal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> monogenetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>--four hypotheses have been chosen, assuming that the individuals having the affected allele (in combination with a healthy one) have 100%, 50%, 40% and 0% chances of developing VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of eight tested models only two--completely dominant and completely recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> models--were rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But, from the six non-rejected models, goodness-of-fit statistics showed that the hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked inheritance</z:hpo> of VA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> with the "healthy" allele being stronger (60% effect on phenotype)--almost perfectly fit the data (chi2 = 2.0023; df = 7; p = 0.9597) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research encompassing a more enlarged family sample is needed to confirm the present findings </plain></SENT>
