<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Echocardiography is often performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, even when alternative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causes are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of echocardiography in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by stenosis of a major intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Versus Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial was a National Institutes of Health-funded, randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which 569 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributed to angiographically proven 50% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with unequivocal cardiac sources of embolism were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was compared among patients who had or did not have echocardiography performed before enrollment, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether echocardiographic abnormalities present in greater than 5% of patients were associated with these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 264 of 569 patients in WASID had echocardiograms; 37% were transesophageal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 264 patients, 69 had subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent echocardiography had similar event rates to those who did not (P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Common abnormalities identified on echocardiography were not associated with subsequent risk in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, echocardiography appears to offer limited diagnostic and prognostic value </plain></SENT>
