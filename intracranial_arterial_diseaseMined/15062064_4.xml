<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and short-term outcome of endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty for the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angioplasty and stent placement were administered to treat 46 patients with lesions of atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis, including 16 lesions of basilar artery, 12 of vertebral artery, 13 of internal carotid artery and 9 of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 49 of 50 vessels (98%), with no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or cerebral ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> occurred in 1 patient and was successfully treated with a self-expand stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> by microwire with no permanent neurologic deficit, and another 2 patients had groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic examination immediately after stenting revealed that the stenosis rate was significantly reduced (72.4% +/- 12.3% vs 10.6% +/- 7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no cerebral ischemic attack in the 37 patients who were clinically followed up (6 - 18 months, mean of 8.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of intracranial stenosis is safe and feasible, and it may be favorable for decreasing the incidence of ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
