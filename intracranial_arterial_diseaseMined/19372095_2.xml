<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total number of 26 children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a control group of 50 healthy children were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in allelic and genotypic distribution were detected in comparisons between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when combined genotypes were analyzed, statistical significance was observed for the association of MTHFR CT and eNOS TT gene variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest that this genotype combination represents a risk factor of 7.2 (P = .017) for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
