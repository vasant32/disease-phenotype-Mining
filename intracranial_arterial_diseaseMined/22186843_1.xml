<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiological features of patients with an Ap/T-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1749 conventional cerebral angiography procedures were performed in 1282 patients from January 2005 to July 2011 at Daegu Fatima Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images were evaluated for cerebral arterial anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The radiological features of an Ap/T-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, coexisting anomalies, and clinical manifestations were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These prospectively maintained databases were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ap/T-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were found in 15 patients (1.17% angiographic incidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anomalies were confined to unilateral M1 segment, and no stenoses were seen in the adjacent major arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 15 patients, 6 (40%) had hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 5 (33.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, and 4 (26.7%) had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> were found in 5 patients (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coexisting cerebral arterial anomalies were seen in 12 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent conservative treatments, and the remaining 5 underwent surgical treatments, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, indirect revascularization, and clipping or coiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An Ap/T-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is a rare anomaly and should be differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> conditions and degenerative steno-occlusive diseases of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Coexisting anomalies of the anterior or middle cerebral arteries are frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This anomaly is vulnerable to both hemorrhagic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
