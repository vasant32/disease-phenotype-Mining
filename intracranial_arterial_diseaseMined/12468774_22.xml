<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the distribution of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) is known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few reports have carefully examined the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> associated with the AICA infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous neurological reports have not emphasized the inner ear as a localization of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> associated with the AICA infarction and the sites predominantly involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over 2 years, we prospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with unilateral AICA infarction diagnosed by brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pure-tone audiogram, speech discrimination testing, stapedial reflex testing, and auditory brainstem response were performed to localize the site of lesion in the auditory pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electronystagmography was also performed to evaluate the function of the vestibular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common affected site on brain MRI was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> auditory symptoms such as hearing loss or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> as an isolated manifestation from 1 day to 2 months before infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Audiological testings confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in 11 patients (92%), predominantly cochlear in 6 patients, retrocochlear in 1 patient, and combined on the affected side cochlear and retrocochlear in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electronystagmography demonstrated no response to caloric stimulation in 10 patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series, sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> was an important sign for the diagnosis of AICA infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Audiological examinations suggest that sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> in AICA infarction is usually due to dysfunction of the cochlea resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to the inner ear </plain></SENT>
