<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed diagnostic criteria were prospectively applied for TCD interpretation independent of angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 320 consecutive patients referred to the neurosonology service with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, 190 (59%) patients also underwent angiography (MRA or DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>48 of those 190 patients had angiographic occlusion and 12 of those 48 patients had involvement of multiple vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median time from TCD until angiography was performed was 1 hour (41 patients had angiography before TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD showed 40 true positive, 8 false negative, 8 false positive, and 134 true negative studies with sensitivity 83.0%, specificity 94.4%, positive predictive value 83.0%, negative predictive value 94.4%, and accuracy 91.6% to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for each individual occlusion site was: proximal ICA 94%, distal ICA 81%, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 93% tVA 56%, BA 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specificity ranged from 96% to 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD is sensitive and specific in determining the site of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> using detailed diagnostic criteria, including proximal ICA and distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD has the highest accuracy for ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the results of TCD are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, there is at least a 94% chance that angiographic studies will be negative </plain></SENT>
