<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The use of ultrasonography in the study of extracranial pathologies is becoming widespread among the different neurology services in our community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its main limitation is that it is a technique that depends on the explorer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability of our Neurosonology laboratory by validating its results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study by selecting the first 100 consecutive patients (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>) who had been examined in the year 2001 in the Neurosonology laboratory in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These subjects had to fulfil the requirement of having been submitted to both a Doppler study (carotid and transcranial) and a vascular neuroimaging study using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or panarteriography of the supra-aortic trunks (SAT) and of the brain by means of femoral puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study of the SAT the Doppler detected stenosis or occlusion with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 92.3% and, therefore, a positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 86.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>75% of the occlusions were diagnosed with three false positives (which were in fact critical stenoses above 95% instead of occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As regards the evaluation of the transcranial Doppler (TCD), the sensitivity of the Doppler scan to detect stenoses above 50% is situated at 79%, with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo>, however, sensitivity is 92.8%, and specificity is 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Findings agree with those offered by other studies conducted in our area using this technique, and show the reliability of this technique carried out in our Neurosonology laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe that Doppler echography of the SAT and TCD can be used for achieve an initial evaluation of cerebrovascular pathologies </plain></SENT>
