<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of neuroimaging abnormalities in adult patients with SCD and their relationship to transcranial Doppler is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to study the frequency of MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography abnormalities in adults with SCD and to define what transcranial Doppler velocities are associated with intracranial stenoses detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients (&gt;16 years) with SCD followed in the hematology outpatient clinic at our university hospital with MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of MRI abnormalities was 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal MRI findings were more frequent when vessel tortuosity or stenoses were present on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with intracranial stenoses had significantly higher time-averaged maximum mean velocities (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A time-averaged maximum mean velocity of 123.5 cm/s allowed the diagnosis of middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery intracranial stenosis with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 73% with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.91 (CI, 0.79 to 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of brain imaging abnormalities detected by MRI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in adults with SCD was higher than that described for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler velocities in adult patients with intracranial stenoses were lower than those described for the pediatric population with SCD </plain></SENT>
