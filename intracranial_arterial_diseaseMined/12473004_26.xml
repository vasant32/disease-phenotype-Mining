<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether cilostazol, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase III inhibitor</z:chebi>, improves treadmill and community-based walking ability and health-related quality of life (HQL) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective meta-analysis of data pooled from six Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients were recruited from outpatient ambulatory medical care facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients' (n = 1,751) mean age +/- standard deviation was 65 +/- 9, and they had a history of PAD for 6 months or longer and an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.90 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Cilostazol 50 mg bid or 100 mg bid for 12, 16, or 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: ABI; maximal walking distance (MWD); pain-free walking distance on a graded and constant-load treadmill; and HQL, measured using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maximal treadmill walking distance improved more in both cilostazol groups than in the placebo group (both P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WIQ and SF-36 physical summary scores improved significantly more with cilostazol than with placebo (for instance, WIQ distance score, P &lt;.0001 and SF-36 physical summary score, P &lt;.0001, comparing persons taking cilostazol with controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved MWD correlated with improvements in WIQ (correlation with distance score, r = 0.34, P &lt;.0001) and SF-36 physical summary scores (r = 0.29, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with cilostazol was associated with greater improvements in community-based walking ability and HQL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> than treatment with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These improvements correlated with increased MWD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis of effects of cilostazol on improving walking ability in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> is the first cilostazol study focused on community-based measures of functional status and HQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires assessing walking ability and HQL provide important patient-based information about clinical outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
