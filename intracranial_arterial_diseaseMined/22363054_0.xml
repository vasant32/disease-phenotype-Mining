<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We hypothesized that patients with intracranial stenosis with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentations would face lower risks of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those with index nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and that their recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> would predominantly be lacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed subjects enrolled with an index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> into the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was classified as lacunar or nonlacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were generated with stratification for severity of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred forty-seven subjects were enrolled after an index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 38 were lacunar and 309 were nonlacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 1.8 years, there was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence between patients whose index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was lacunar (7 of 38 [18%]) versus nonlacunar (69 of 309 [22%]; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.36-1.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant differences were found when groups were stratified by 50% to 69% stenosis (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.12-2.1) and â‰¥ 70% stenosis (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients whose index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was lacunar, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 were nonlacunar and 3 were in the territory of the stenotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis, the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was similar in patients who presented with lacunar and nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients presenting with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were typically nonlacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is related to the stenosis rather than small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> should be included in trials investigating secondary prevention for symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
