<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a consistent body of evidence that socioeconomic status (SES) is importantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little information currently exists on the relationship between SES and early manifestations of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the association between education, income, and occupation and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in a population-based sample of eastern Finnish men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the Kuopio <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischemic Heart Disease</z:e> Risk Factor Study were used to estimate mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> across levels of SES in 1140 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between SES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was examined in relation to atherosclerotic risk factors and was also stratified by degree of atherosclerotic progression and was also stratified by degree of atherosclerotic progression and prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant, inverse, graded differences between levels of SES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For education, the age-adjusted mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e> for those with primary schooling or less, some high school, and completed high school or more were 0.96, 0.94, and 0.82 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> between the most extreme categories of education corresponds to a 15.4% increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns were found for each measure of SES, although the differences between the highest and lowest levels of SES were attenuated by adjustment for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In men who had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or nonstenotic plaque and in men who had no indication of prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, a graded, inverse association between SES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> persisted, even after risk factor adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a strong association between SES and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in an unselected population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that this association was mediated by known atherosclerotic risk factors, was evident in the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and was apparent in a healthy subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the impact of SES is evident early in the natural history of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
