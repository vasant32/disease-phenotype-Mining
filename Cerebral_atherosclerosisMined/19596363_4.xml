<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> multifactorial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, a large number of candidate genes are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathophysiology, such as blood pressure regulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism is considered to have a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, its relationship with cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in different ethnic populations is still inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ACE I/D polymorphism, detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was studied in 97 patients with large-vessel and 60 patients with small-vessel atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (44 asymptomatic, 16 symptomatic lacunes) and 85 healthy subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demographic data, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and risk factors of patients and controls were obtained retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ACE genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of DD, ID and II genotype were 41%, 40%, and 19%, respectively, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in ACE I/D polymorphism distribution were statistically insignificant between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This lack of association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ACE I/D polymorphism did not change in the presence of traditional risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly more common in the patient groups, ACE I/D polymorphism showed no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This lack of association also did not change according to groups or in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, male gender or smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ACE I/D polymorphism did not predict the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in our population living in the western Black Sea region of Turkey </plain></SENT>
