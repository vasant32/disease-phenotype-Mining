<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CT Scan (D1) demonstrated blood in the peri-peduncular cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A first angiogram through femoral route was performed at D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no vascular malformation on both carotid territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was demonstrated on the basilar artery, arising at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left posterior cerebral artery was supplied only by the left carotid artery through a dilated posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second left vertebral angiogram was performed at D8, to make sure whether this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or a non aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but failed to provide certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was operated upon at D17, with the diagnosis of possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Through a pterional route the posterior communicating artery was approached, no blood was found in the area of the upper basilar artery; there was an abnormal posterior circle of Willis, the superior cerebellar artery arising with a common trunk from the upper basilar artery; distal to this common trunk, the P1 segment was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the first three fourths of its course; the last fourth of the P1 segment was highly narrowed, the outer diameter of the narrowed P1 segment was approximately one third of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> P1 segment, and was located at the junction with the complex posterior communicating artery-P2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This narrowed part of the P1 segment showed evidence of an atheromatous plaque on its wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found in this area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
