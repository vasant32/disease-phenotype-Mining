<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with atheromatous stenosis of the proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of more than 30% (3 of these cases with stenosis of more that 75%) had repeated transcranial Doppler between 1975 and 1987 and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>-producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (symptomatic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were asymptomatic (asymptomatic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory occurred in 1 patient of each group and 1 additional patient in each group had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in another territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was possible in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stenosis remained unchanged in 14, occlusion occurred in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of transcranial Doppler were compared to those of angiograms in this series and in an additional series of 40 patients who had had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of transcranial Doppler was 60% (75% when stenosis was over 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison with angiography findings showed, among causes of failure of tD, analysis of the artery over too short a segment or kinked artery of very long stenoses, or too decreased blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The failure rate of tD due to failure of bone penetration by ultrasounds was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This new reproducible, non-invasive method appears to be able to detect <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses of 50% or more and help in follow-up </plain></SENT>
