<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used computational fluid dynamic methods to analyze <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> patterns of wall shear stress (WSS), a known critical modulator of endothelial function, within patient-based IS lesions undergoing percutaneous angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-resolution three-dimensional rotational angiographic data sets were reconstructed to yield a fine-resolution computational mesh allowing application of pulsatile computational fluid dynamic analysis with a non-Newtonian realistic model of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WSS and its gradient were analyzed spatiotemporally in five IS lesions before and after percutaneous angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: WSS within the stenosis reached average shear magnitudes of 1870 +/- 783 dyn/cm with rapidly reversing direction to oscillating low values in the recirculation zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WSS vectors revealed complex dynamic directional and amplitude oscillations not seen in healthy segments with time-dependent convergence and divergence strips sweeping back and forth across the lesion during the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These areas also underwent extreme temporal WSS oscillation of 2052 +/- 909 dyn/cm over a short time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endothelial mechanotransductive response to such extreme WSS magnitudes and gradients, which were normalized by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in the current study, remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Computational fluid dynamic analysis of IS has uncovered a complex and hostile microhemodynamic environment characterized by wide and rapid shear variations in time and space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the mechanical forces acting on the wall can help in determining the molecular transduction response of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> endothelium to these extreme stresses and may lead to better understanding of the hemodynamic contribution to stenosis pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
