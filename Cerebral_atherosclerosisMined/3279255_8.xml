<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of our study was to visualize and document early atheromatous lesions in the carotid arteries of asymptomatic patients with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> under 30 years of age by Duplex-scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 44 patients, 70% had detectable carotid plaques, while only 12% of the controls were affected </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the age group 2-20 years, 66% of the patients exhibited plaques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the process of atheromatous plaque formation in patients with FH starts early in life, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> being a function of both extent and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duplex-scan examination of the carotid arteries is efficient and precise non-invasive method suitable to visualize this process and, by measuring regression, monitor the efficacy of therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
