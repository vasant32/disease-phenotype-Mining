<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the nature of the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae or of other members of the order Chlamydiales in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive sections of 13 carotid artery specimens obtained at necropsy and of C pneumoniae infected HEp2 cells were analysed using: (1) immunocytochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) to detect C pneumoniae membrane protein; (2) in situ hybridisation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment of the omp1 gene to detect C pneumoniae specific DNA; (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> using an oligonucleotide probe to detect Chlamydiales specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA; (4) PCR to detect C pneumoniae <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rDNA; and (5) in situ DNA nick and labelling (TUNEL) to detect fragmented DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Staining by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> of infected HEp2 cells showed characteristic inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chlamydia pneumoniae membrane protein was demonstrated in macrophages in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> (six of six), but not in fatty streaks (none of two), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries (none of five) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> assays using both probes and PCR were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative, indicating the absence of both specific C pneumoniae DNA and Chlamydiales specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only after treatment with DNAse I were uniformly sized dots demonstrated by the TUNEL assay in inclusions of infected HEp2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TUNEL assay showed a similar staining pattern in macrophages in five carotid artery specimens, of which four were also positive for C pneumoniae membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both macrophage populations were morphologically similar and were similarly distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was obtained for the involvement of other members of the order Chlamydiales in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of C pneumoniae antigen in the absence of DNA and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA suggests that antigens, rather than viable bacteria, persist in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
