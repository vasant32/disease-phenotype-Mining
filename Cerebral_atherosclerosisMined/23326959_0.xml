<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to analyze the MMP-9 levels in blood within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to observe the role of MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated prospectively MMP-9 levels in serum from 106 patients (42 men and 64 women, mean age 71.52 +/- 6.32 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery area in the first 24 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean duration 7.8 +/- 4.5 hours) as compared to 112 controls (48 men and 64 women, mean age 70.36 +/- 6.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected under <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> conditions and stored in aliquots at -70 degrees C until assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum MMP-9 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in blood samples obtained on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by Mann-Whitney and Log-Likeliwood Ratio tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> values reported are expressed as mean (x) +/- SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean serum MMP-9 concentrations were higher in group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 172 +/- 32.4 ng/mL, range 139.6-204.4 ng/mL vs. controls 57 +/- 9.6 ng/mL, range 47.4-66.6 ng/mL (95% CI, 3.17 to 14.18; p &lt; 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MMP-9 activity is associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high levels of MMP-9 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> document the involvement of this enzyme in the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
