<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of a patient's cerebral vascular status is essential for accurately classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, vascular evaluations have been incomplete in previous studies, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry based on the results of such vascular investigations has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> based on vascular imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 2001 and August 2003, 1,264 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt; 7 days) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were admitted to Asan Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 1,167 patients (750 men and 417 women; mean age 63.3 years) underwent an angiogram (mostly a magnetic resonance angiogram) and were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, while 31.2% underwent echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subtypes were categorized with the aid of a modification of the Trial of ORG 10172 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) was the most frequent subtype (42%), followed by small-vessel occlusion (SVO, 27%), cardiogenic embolism (CE, 15%), undetermined etiology (15%), and other determined etiology (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (71%), cigarette smoking (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (30%), history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (22.7%), emboligenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> (20%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was more common in patients with SVO than in those with other subtypes (p&lt;0.05), and the case-fatality rate was higher in patients with CE than in those with other subtypes (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was worse in patients with LAA than in those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry based on vascular imaging results, LAA was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of LAA is probably related to the increased identification of the presence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram </plain></SENT>
