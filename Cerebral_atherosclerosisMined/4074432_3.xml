<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to the repetitive administration study, the antiplatelet-aggregating effect of the drug was examined by single administration at 50 and 100 mg to six patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of 50 mg was not sufficiently effective, but the dose of 100 mg significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced aggregation induced by collagen and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> at 6 h suggesting the therapeutic value of the drug even by single administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following this study, the antiplatelet-aggregating effect of the drug was determined after four weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment values for <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation were 72.7, 72.1, 70.5 and 78.8% in the 50 mg/day (once daily), 100 mg/day (50 mg twice a day), 150 mg/day (50 mg three times a day) and 200 mg/day (100 mg twice a day) dosage groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aggregation rates determined after 4 weeks of treatment were 60.8, 56.8, 46.0 and 43.8%, respectively, and the values obtained at 100 mg/day or higher were significantly (p less than 0.05) low compared to the respective pretreatment values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
