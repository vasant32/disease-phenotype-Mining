<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge tests to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) in 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (mean age 70.8 years) with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Systemic blood pressure was significantly decreased from baseline after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline global CBFs before and after treatment were 38.2 +/- 5.6 mL/min/100 g and 39.9 +/- 9.0 mL/min/100 g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CVRs before and after treatment were 52.2 +/- 18.4% and 39.7 +/- 18.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in these parameters were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both regional CBF and CVR in the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata with moderate or severe white matter lesions were also preserved after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> therapy compared with those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral hemodynamics were preserved after blood pressure lowering with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> could be a feasible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> regimen in terms of cerebral circulation in patients with cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
