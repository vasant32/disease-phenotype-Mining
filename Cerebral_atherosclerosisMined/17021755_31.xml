<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) has been a subject of debate since the first decade of the last century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial "vascular hypothesis" of AD was rejected after a series of mid-twentieth century gross anatomical postmortem studies that showed an inconstant relationship between intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These early studies did not utilize statistical methods, however, and the investigators did not appear to consider the possibility that intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> might have a probabilistic, rather than an absolute, effect on AD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies by three independent groups have found a significant statistical association between postmortem measures of circle of Willis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to further address the validity of this association in a large autopsy series, including cases diagnosed neuropathologically with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem gross anatomical grading of circle of Willis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was performed in 397 subjects classified by neuropathological diagnosis, including 92 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> elderly controls, 215 with AD, 30 with VaD and 60 with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circle of Willis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was more severe in subjects with AD and VaD than in control subjects, while it was equivalent between control subjects and subjects with non-AD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing atherosclerotic grade increased the odds ratios (OR) for the diagnoses of both AD and VaD and also increased the ORs for both increased neuritic plaque density and higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of these associations was retained after consideration of the effects of age, gender and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E-epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the statistical association between intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and AD is not an artifact of diagnostic misclassification or of unequal distribution of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E-epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
