<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the thickness of the layers of the carotid artery (externa, media, and intima) are affected by menopause and its treatment with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine postmenopausal women were recruited sequentially and classified into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six were taking oral HRT, 32 had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> implants, and 51 had never taken HRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three layers of the externa wall of the carotid artery were identified and measured by high-resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with implants had thicker carotid artery wall measurements (0.84 +/- 0.26 mm) than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The media (0.32 +/- 0.11 mm) was significantly thicker in the implant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This layer has a high connective tissue component, including collagen type I, collagen type III, and elastin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intima layer was thinner (0.25 +/- 0.09 mm) in the oral HRT group compared with controls (0.29 +/- 0.1 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant higher intima-media ratio (1.17 +/- 0.05) was calculated for the control group, compared with both the oral HRT (0.92 +/- 0.04) and implant groups (0.94 +/- 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HRT given to postmenopausal women influences differentially the layers of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hormones seem to encourage thickening of the layers with the highest connective tissue component (externa and media) and to delay thickening of the atheromatous intima layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects on the vascular system may be partly responsible for the cardioprotection attributed to HRT </plain></SENT>
