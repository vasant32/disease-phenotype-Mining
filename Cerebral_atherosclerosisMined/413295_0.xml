<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main group consisted of patients from 40-67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with the similar clinical study rheoencephalographic and electroencephalographic studies with the aid of various functional samples were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial manifestations of the inadequacy in the brain blood supply frequently developed on the background of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of a different type of expressiveness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e> and their combination, vegetovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the help of the functional samples the peculiarities of reactivity of the vascular system were established in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antiorthostatic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> samples appeared to be informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined REG and EEG registrations demonstrated in these patients signs of a deficit of brain blood supply causing in a number of cases changes in its functional states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical (seldom electrographic) changes are of a reversible character and regress during the treatment of the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obtained data permit to recommend the method of functional electrography (REG and EEG) in order to reveal the initial forms of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients must be supervised by a dispansary </plain></SENT>
