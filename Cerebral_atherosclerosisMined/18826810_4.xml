<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was invented more than 20 years ago, but only gained acceptance recently, thanks to advancements in the computer technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can demonstrate areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion with accuracy nearly that of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is also able to clearly illustrate calcification, which is more difficult to define on magnetic resonance angiography and is not clearly depicted on DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our retrospective study attempted to clarify the rate of occlusion or stenosis in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the period of 7 months, 93 consecutive patients were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients underwent CTA and were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were admitted after 6 hours following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 28 men and 28 women, and 80.4% of the cohort was of African-American origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were attributed to small-vessel disease (25/56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rest of the cases were deemed secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> (15/56), cardioembolism (9/56) or of unclear etiology (7/56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 24 (42.9%) patients, CTA failed to reveal any abnormalities of the cerebrovascular tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTA demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in ten (17.9%) patients and stenosis of extracranial or intracranial arteries on the symptomatic side in 22 (39.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was very good correlation between CTA and ultrasound techniques (carotid duplex and transcranial Doppler) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CTA was superior in demonstrating distal intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, CTA is an extremely valuable and fast way to emergently evaluate the cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, making it very useful for pre-thrombolysis evaluation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
