<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous observations of ours had shown a Con A positive reaction ("glycocalyx" or "surface coat") at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface and in the plasmalemmal vesicles of aortic endothelial cells of rabbits an other laboratory animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "surface coat" is now reputed the site of lipoproteinlipase activity whose importance in atherogenesis has recently been stressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our present observations, the endothelial cells Con A reactivity after Bernhard and Avrameas which was not previously studied in the cerebral arteries of rabbits and monkeys has resulted always lacking in this arterial district </plain></SENT>
