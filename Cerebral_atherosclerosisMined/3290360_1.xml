<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of extracranial tract has been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reliability of echotomography as diagnostic and prognostic tool in the evaluation of the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> is now intensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the attention has been payed to the accuracy in the determination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> do not correlate to the <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> but to the other modifications induced by the atherosclerotic plaque, such as the release of emboli, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stenosis for intraplaque haemorrhage or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the evaluation of the composition of the plaque may represent a good prognostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, fifty-two carotid obtained at surgery from patients, who preoperatively underwent ultrasonographic scanning of both carotid arteries, were examined by histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In calcified tissues a significant correlation between findings obtained with both techniques was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the complicated plaques atheromasic gruel, intraplaque haemorrhages and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could not be discriminated by echotomography </plain></SENT>
