<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormality of BAEPs (first recorded 10 days after infarction) indicated that brainstem damage extended beyond the basis pontis, where, typically, interruption of corticospinal pathways results in the "locked-in" syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Later, partial BAEP recovery suggested that the technique can be used to distinguish between permanent and transient brainstem involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy examination revealed close correspondence between permanent brainstem damage and persistent BAEP abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent abnormal prolongation of III-V conduction time and aberration of wave IV were associated with damage near the lateral lemniscus contralateral to the stimulated ear </plain></SENT>
