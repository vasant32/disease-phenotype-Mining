<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants aged 40 years or more have been evaluated for the presence of cerebral microbleeds using 3D T2*-GRE sequence since 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery images was assessed using Fazekas rating scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted after adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, age, PVH, DWMH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50427">platelet aggregation inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we examined the association between cerebral microbleeds and other covariates using a Pearson's correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst 389 patients, 67 patients had a single microbleed and 93 had multiple microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of microbleeds was 83% amongst 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), 49% amongst 173 with infarction, and 20% amongst 163 without any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analyses, the odds ratio (95% CIs) of microbleed detection was 10.1, (4.12-24.8) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, 2.33 (1.12-4.85) for atherosclerotic infarction, 1.66 (1.10-2.48) for PVH, and 1.49 (1.02-2.19) for DWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the Pearson's correlation analysis, cerebral microbleeds were closely related to PVH (Pearson's correlation coefficient; 0.48) and DWMH (0.37), compared with age (0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-grade PVH, high-grade DWMH, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, and atherosclerotic infarction were significantly independent predictors for cerebral microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the grades of PVH and DWMH have a closer association with the number of cerebral microbleeds than age </plain></SENT>
