<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred eighty seven patients with 3-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> subjected to aorto-coronary or mammary-coronary grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Proportions of closed venous grafts were 24,2% among grafts to arteries with 50-75% stenoses, 13.1% among grafts to occluded arteries (p=0.023), and 20.1% among grafts to arteries with 75-99% stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among venous grafts to arteries with lumen diameter &lt;1.5 mm 30.4% were occluded what was significantly more than among grafts to vessels with 1.5-2.5 mm (15.5%, p=0.003) and &gt;2.5 mm (14.5%, p=0.004) diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological risk factors of venous graft closure in immediate postoperative period were 50-75% stenosis and lumen diameter &lt;1.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mammary-coronary anastomoses were patent in 1 year, 99% of them remained patent 5 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between patency of venous grafts after 5 years of follow-up and morphological characteristics (lumen diameter and percent stenosis) of bypassed arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During first year there was no significant differences between patients with patent and occluded grafts both in incidences of novel <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> (10.4 and 10.3%, respectively, p=0.943) and proportion of closures of initially stenotic arteries (9.6 and 10.3%, respectively, p=0.085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 5 years novel <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were found in 31.9 and 33.6% of patients with patent and occluded grafts, respectively (p=0.910) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusions of stenosed vessels proximal to anastomosis occurred more often among patients with patent than with occluded grafts (28.6 and 15.9%, respectively, p=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus in remote postoperative period development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in proximal segments of arteries with patent grafts was more 'aggressive' than in arteries with occluded grafts </plain></SENT>
