<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the association between incident (first) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the echogenicity of internal carotid arterial plaque at ultrasonography (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 4, 886 individuals who, at baseline, were 65 years of age or older and without symptoms of cerebrovascular disease was followed up for an average of 3.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical findings were from color Doppler and duplex US studies of the carotid arteries and a record of traditional risk factors: age, sex, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, pack-years of cigarette smoking, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, excluding hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of cardiac origin, were seen in 104 individuals (2.1%) at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significant for hypoechoic plaque (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1,42,4.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After controlling for risk factors in a Cox proportional hazards model, the relative risk (RR) of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.72 (p = .015) for hypoechoic plaque and 2.32 (P = .004) for internal carotid arterial narrowing of at least 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, hypoechoic plaque (RR, 2.78; CI, 1.36,5.69) and 50%-100% stenosis (RR, 3.08; CI, 1.28, 7.41) were associated with ipsilateral, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic adults aged 65 years or older, that risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with two US features: hypoechoic internal carotid arterial plaque and an estimated internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> of 50%-100% </plain></SENT>
