<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our study refers to the complex neuropathologic examination of 70 demented patients (40 males and 30 females) above 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proportion of different types of cerebral damage with vascular pathogeny showed that 78% of the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases had as morphological background various aspects of multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>; softenings of variable size and lacunae, associated or not with myelinic rarefactions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> specific to subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>; the remaining cases pointed to single anoxic lesion and/or subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perfect clinico-morphological diagnostic concordance has not always been reached in our sample--as in literature cases--often due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtypes overlapping, and to the fact that the same clinical syndrome may show in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no correlation has been found between lesion type, site or size and clinical picture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> course, which was also reported by other authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On a morphopathogenic basis, we support the view that necrotic lesions of ischemic origin--multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>--should be distinguished from myelinic rarefactions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> in the white matter, whose pathogeny is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due attention is paid to the importance of the venous factor in the development of subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
