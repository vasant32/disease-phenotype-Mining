<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors briefly report their experience regarding the opportunities offered by the use of current ultrasound methods in carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They describe: a system for the quantification of athcromasic plaque used to monitor non-operated patients over time; ultrasound methods used to analyse the carotid wall to establish whether it can be utilised as an index of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>; the use of transcranial Doppler; criteria for the definition of high risk plaque; the applications of eco-color Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paper also illustrates a new pathology identified by the authors, defined as primary intimal fibrous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and the evolution of the carotid wall after endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structural characteristics of primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> can only be shown using ultrasound given that arteriography cannot distinguish it from atheromatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endarterectomy the carotid wall is subject to hematic and hemodynamic stimuli which determine the type of evolution of the wall itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore examine the myointimal reaction, myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, early restenosis and late restenosis as different facets of the same phenomenon </plain></SENT>
