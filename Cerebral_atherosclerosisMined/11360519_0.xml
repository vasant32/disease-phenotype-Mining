<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty patients with SAS were studied, with 32 patients without SAS as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age, sex and baseline diseases were comparable between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were studied by polysomnography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The systolic (VS) and mean (VM) cerebral blood flow velocities, resistent index (RI), and frequency spectral shape were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries were examined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: VS and VM were significantly lower in patients with SAS than those in the control subjects (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RI of the right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in SAS patients (0.56 +/- 0.06) was significantly higher than that in the controls (0.48 +/- 0.09, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in the cerebral blood flow frequency spectral shape were remarkably increased in the SAS group as compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VS and VM were negatively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> index (r = -0.413 and -0.628, P &lt; 0.05 and 0.01), but positively correlated with SaO2(r = 0.435 and 0.712, P &lt; 0.05 and 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SAS patients have decreased cerebral blood flow velocities and more frequency shape abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These may decrease cerebral perfusions, and lead to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
