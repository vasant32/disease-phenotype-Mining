<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We postulated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients receiving IV tPA with patent vasculature or occult <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> by CT angiography (CTA) would have better outcomes and decreased hemorrhagic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 47 patients from our prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database who underwent CTA before treatment with IV tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Site of occlusion was categorized as M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, M2 segment, multiple (either carotid, basilar, or both middle and anterior cerebral arteries), or absent (no occlusion proximal to M3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of site of occlusion on National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), early improvement (&gt; or = 4-point improvement in NIHSS at 24 hours after treatment), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 7 days was tested in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The location of occlusion correlated with initial NIHSS for multiple, M1, M2 and absent occlusions (median NIHSS scores were 18, 18, 15, 10, respectively) (P &lt; .02, rank sum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following adjustment for initial NIHSS, age, and time to treatment, the absence of occlusion remained associated with early improvement (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.1-23.3; P = .04) and independence at day 7 (mRS &lt; or = 2) (OR 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-34.6; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall prevalence of symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> was 6.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients without occlusion had no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> (0% versus 23.3%; P &lt; .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among patients treated with tPA, those with patent vasculature or occult distal occlusion on CTA before treatment have lower NIHSS, better chances of early improvement and early independence with fewer <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
