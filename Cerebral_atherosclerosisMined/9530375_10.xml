<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our goal was to evaluate non-breath-hold Gd-enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> of the aortic arch vessels and to compare image quality with two breath-hold techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One hundred sixty consecutive patients with known or clinically suspected atherosclerotic cerebrovascular occlusive disease underwent Gd-enhanced 3D MRA of the aortic arch and great vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-six examinations were performed with the body coil after infusion of 40 ml of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>; 89 of these were performed without breath-holding and 37 were acquired during suspended respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four examinations were performed in a body phased-array coil with breath-holding, a timing examination, and 20 ml of contrast agent by manual (n = 17) or power (n = 17) injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were evaluated for the presence of blurring and ghosting artifacts and venous enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 27 patients who underwent non-breath-hold MRI and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), two readers blinded to the DSA results retrospectively evaluated the MRA examinations for the presence of occlusive disease of the innominate, carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DSA correlation was not evaluated for the 71 breath-hold studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for arch vessel occlusive disease with non-breath-hold MRA were 38 and 94% for Reader A and 38 and 95% for Reader B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breath-holding significantly reduced blurring and ghosting artifacts (p &lt; 0.001) when compared with non-breath-hold imaging, and use of 20 ml of contrast medium, with a timing examination, resulted in significantly less venous enhancement than seen with 40 ml (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-breath-hold Gd-enhanced 3D MRA is insensitive for detecting arch vessel occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breath-hold imaging, in conjunction with a timing examination and a lower dose of contrast agent, improves image quality, but further studies are needed to assess diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
