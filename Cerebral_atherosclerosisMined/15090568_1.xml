<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Isolated atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease is often difficult to differentiate from cardioembolic disease if intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> coexists with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether clinical and neuroradiological features of isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease differ according to the underlying aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease was defined as a unilateral angiographically occlusive lesion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on the symptomatic side without lesions of other intracranial or extracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease were divided into atherosclerotic and potentially cardioembolic, and the clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological data analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 850 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>, 107 (12.6%) met the criteria for isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease (76 with atherosclerotic disease and 31 with a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common and baseline NIHSS score was higher in potentially embolic occlusions than in atherosclerotic disease (each p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the potential embolism group (p = 0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively), subcortical border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the atherosclerotic group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were independently associated with atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, while territorial and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with potential cardiac embolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and neuroradiological characteristics can differentiate isolated atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease associated with potential sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, and may reflect the differences in underlying pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
