<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging can provide information about atheroma in vivo including plaque volume, composition,and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> activity of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and determine its relationship with infarction patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were enrolled and 3-T high resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed in the relevant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the status of the intracranial atheroma and infarction pattern in the corresponding vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial atheroma was defined as vulnerable symptomatic plaque when it was accompanied by intraplaque <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> signal intensity and plaque enhancement, and as a stable symptomatic plaque otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> pattern was defined as artery-to-artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> when multiple lesions were present within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled in the study;14 patients had stable symptomatic plaque, 12 had vulnerable symptomatic plaque, and 8 had no plaque (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intracranial atheroma stability and infarction pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-resolution magnetic resonance images were acquired from 34 patients, which revealed the presence of stable symptomatic plaque in 14 patients and vulnerable symptomatic plaque in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients with vulnerable symptomatic plaque more commonly demonstrated an artery-to-artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> pattern than the patients with stable symptomatic plaque (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable symptomatic plaque as determined by a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging technique is associated with artery-to-artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e>.This novel imaging technique can provide information about intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in vivo, which can predict the infarction pattern </plain></SENT>
