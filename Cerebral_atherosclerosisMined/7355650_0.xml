<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the observed population, individuals of a young and middle age prevailed (78% of the patients were younger than 60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of separate etiological factors is different in different age groups in individuals under 40, subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> are mainly produced by a rupture of cerebral vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>; in the age group of 40--59 years by arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while in the elderly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in combination with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in general are more favourable in the older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> of an aneurysmal etiology the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> amounts to 21%, and is especially high in repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> of an aneurysmal etiology the highest <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was recorded in a localization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the anterior communicating artery and anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
