<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The WASID trial (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease) required performance of angiography to verify the presence of intracranial stenosis, allowing for prospective evaluation of TCD and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcomes and Neuroimaging of Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (SONIA) trial were to define abnormalities on TCD/MRA to see how well they identify 50 to 99% intracranial stenosis of large proximal arteries on catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: SONIA standardized the performance and interpretation of TCD, MRA, and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study-wide cutpoints defining positive TCD/MRA were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hard copy TCD/MRA were centrally read, blind to the results of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SONIA enrolled 407 patients at 46 sites in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For prospectively tested noninvasive test cutpoints, positive predictive values (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi>) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were TCD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 36% (95% CI: 27 to 46); NPV, 86% (95% CI: 81 to 89); MRA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 59% (95% CI: 54 to 65); NPV, 91% (95% CI: 89 to 93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For cutpoints modified to maximize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, they were TCD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 50% (95% CI: 36 to 64), NPV 85% (95% CI: 81 to 88); MRA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 66% (95% CI: 58 to 73), NPV 87% (95% CI: 85 to 89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For each test, a characteristic performance curve showing how the predictive values vary with a changing test cutpoint was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both transcranial Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography noninvasively identify 50 to 99% intracranial large vessel stenoses with substantial negative predictive value </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings on transcranial Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography require a confirmatory test such as angiography to reliably identify stenosis </plain></SENT>
