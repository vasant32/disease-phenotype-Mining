<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the family member in both cases and control groups were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence rate of the first-degree relatives in cases was 5.12%, significantly higher than (1.63%) that noticed in controls, with chi 2 = 16.40 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same results was also found in their parents and siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from binominal distribution analysis showed that the number of cases in the families of arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly higher than the theortical range which indicated that there was significant familial aggregation in the occurance of arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression model also showed that genetic factor was one of the most important risk factors in Xi-xing, Jiangsu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose-response was observed in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The heritability and the segregation ratio of arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were the same as seen in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
