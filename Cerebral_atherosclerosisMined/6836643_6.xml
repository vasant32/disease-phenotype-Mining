<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using our primate model we evaluated the ability of NMR scanning to detect early changes following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial NMR scans documented progressive changes secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and swelling beginning ninety minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NMR was also able to readily demonstrate the area of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 10 days after a six hour episode of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soft tissue contrast and image resolution were superb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation with pathologic sections was excellent </plain></SENT>
