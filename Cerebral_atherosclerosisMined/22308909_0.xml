<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our research work, which has led us to discovering the new cerebral cell, has started 30 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important moment was the year 1986, when we have highlighted it for the first time, during a study upon the clarification of some undiscovered aspects of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2006 we have initiated the publishing of our results at three congresses (Cape Town - 2006; San Diego - 2009 and Los Angeles - 2011) as well as in three Atlases, form 2006, 2008 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By means of the electronic microscope we have analyzed to this purpose alone, a number of neurosurgery patients, with 1176 cerebral, vascular, tumoral, cortical, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085138" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroid plexus tumor</z:e> and infectious biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell in question was named cordocit-protectocit (thread-protective cell) in order to highlight its morphological aspect of a belt band and its functional one, of protective element of the noble substance of the brain, acting for its defense against various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressions</z:hpo>, especially hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On this occasion we have discovered that the pia mater is made up of such protective cells, which also play a role in preventing the neuroblasts from migrating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the chemotactants of our cells are not numerous enough, subcortical cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002282'>heterotopias</z:hpo> will occur, at the level of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, double cortex and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002269'>neuronal migration disorders</z:hpo> which may generate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pia mater should be considered from a cytodynamic perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The telocyte at the internal organs level (intestine, heart etc.) is nothing else but the interstitial cell of Cajal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>), described by Cajal more than 100 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> spontaneously initiate rhythmic electrical activity, much like the peacemaker cells of the heart </plain></SENT>
