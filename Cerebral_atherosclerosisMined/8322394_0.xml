<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The literature concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in young adults compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in young adults is scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in young patients (aged 45 years or younger) compared with older patients (aged older than 45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1981 and 1991, 75 young patients (aged 45 years or younger) and 723 older patients (aged older than 45 years) were diagnosed as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History of presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, risk factors, clinical features, investigations, and etiology were compared on the basis of the above age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In younger patients the presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred less frequently in the vertebrobasilar territory (9% versus 21%, P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factor analysis revealed significant differences between the groups, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous smoking history, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> being more common in the older group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> were more common in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60% of the patients in each group had multiple etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common etiology was atheromatous cerebrovascular disease in both groups (74% versus 37% [P &lt; .0001] in the older and younger groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other significant etiologic differences included fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and use of oral contraceptives occurring more frequently in the younger group, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> occurring more frequently in the older group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the clinical and etiologic differences between younger and older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of multiple etiologies in both groups of patients has diagnostic and management implications </plain></SENT>
