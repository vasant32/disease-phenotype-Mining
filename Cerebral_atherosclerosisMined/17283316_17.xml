<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether symptomatic severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was associated with a higher subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk than moderate stenosis after elective angioplasty with a balloon-expandable stent and to explore which factors were associated with the subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2001 and June 2005, there were 220 symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses in 213 patients undergoing elective stenting at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these stenoses, 126 in 121 patients were &gt; or =70% severe stenoses, and 94 in 92 patients were 50% to 69% moderate stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints included lesion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and symptomatic brain or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten primary endpoint events occurred in the severe stenosis group (six within 30 days and four in mean follow-up of 26.0 months after 30 days), and seven occurred in the moderate stenosis group (four within 30 days and three in mean follow-up of 27.6 months after 30 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in cumulative probability of primary endpoints between the severe (7.2% at 1 year and 8.2% at 2 years) and moderate (5.3% at 1 year and 8.3% at 2 years) stenosis groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No single factor was found to be associated with primary endpoints in the moderate stenosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis revealed that stent failure was the only predictor of primary endpoints in the severe stenosis group (hazard ratio 5.31, 95% CI 1.35 to 20.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis did not present a higher subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk than moderate stenosis after elective angioplasty with a balloon-expandable stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe stenosis may benefit from successful stent placement, and randomized trials are necessary to demonstrate this possible benefit </plain></SENT>
