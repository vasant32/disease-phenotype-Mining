<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed in both patients a stenotic atherosclerotic plaque of the intracranial vertebral artery between the posterior and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At operation, the first patient had an atherosclerotic plaque extending into the basilar artery, and no endarterectomy was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient had a 1-cm localized plaque that was removed successfully from the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither patient sustained a neurological deficit as a result of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient whose plaque was not removed at operation continues to have vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and suffered a brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient whose plaque was removed at operation continues to be free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> 8 months later, and angiography performed 3 months after operation showed a widely patent vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A portion of the intracranial vertebral artery has now been shown to be accessible to endarterectomy using the operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography is helpful in determining this accessibility preoperatively </plain></SENT>
