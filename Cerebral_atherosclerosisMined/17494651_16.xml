<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recent trial shows an 8.3 per 100-patient-years' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> rate in the territory of the intracranial stenotic artery, despite aspirin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to prospectively study the feasibility and outcome of a new intracranial balloon-expandable Apollo stent for symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis (SAIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients (41 men and 5 women; median, 54 years of age) with forty-eight &gt;or=50% SAISs were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedural feasibility was evaluated by stent success (residual stenosis &lt;or=30%) and procedural time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the target-lesion artery territory, including any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four lesions (91.7%) obtained stent success within a median procedural time of 50.6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe tortuosity correlated with stent failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6.5%, 3/46) had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were available for follow-up (46 had 30-day follow-up, 45 had 6-month follow-up, 44 had 12- and 18-month follow-up, and 24 had follow-up of &gt;or=24 months), which varied from 1 month to 30.7 months (median, 23.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 30 days, 1 patient (2.2%, 1/46) developed minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the target-lesion artery territory at 6.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary end point rate was 4.3 per 100 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was performed in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven restenoses (28%, 7/25) were detected, 1 of which was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angioplasty with the Apollo stent for symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Severe tortuosity is an independent predictor of stent failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our clinical outcome seems to compare favorably with results of aspirin therapy, but the restenotic rate was high </plain></SENT>
