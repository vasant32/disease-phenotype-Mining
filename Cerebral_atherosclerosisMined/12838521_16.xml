<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous observations suggested that multiple ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a source of these multiple lesions was the recurrence of ischemic lesions within a week after a clinically symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 99 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients scanned within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and at subsequent times within the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion recurrence was defined as any new lesion separate from the index lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent lesions occurring outside initial perfusion deficit were termed 'distant lesion recurrence' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of recurrence associated with clinical and imaging characteristics using log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Any lesion recurrence was found in 34%, with distant lesion recurrence in 15%, while clinical recurrence was evident in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial multiple DWI lesions were associated with any lesion recurrence (HR, 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.29; p = 0.002) and with distant lesion recurrence (HR, 5.99; 95% CI, 4.05-64.07; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype associated with any lesion recurrence (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate a prolonged state of increased ischemic risk over the first week and suggest DWI as a possible surrogate measure for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
