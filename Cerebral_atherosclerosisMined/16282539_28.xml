<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug-eluting stents (DES) have revolutionized the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and have greatly reduced the risk of in-stent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with the feasibility and safety of using DES for patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had &gt;70% stenoses and had failed maximal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were pretreated with aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, and intraprocedural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the lesions were predilated, and balloons and stents were slightly undersized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin were continued for 1 year, and patients had clinical follow-up and vascular imaging at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with intracranial internal carotid artery (3), middle cerebral (2), basilar (2), and vertebral artery (1) stenoses were successfully treated with 4 Cypher (Cordis Corp) and 4 Taxus (Boston Scientific Inc) stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis severity was reduced from 84.4%+/-10.2% to 2.5%+/-4.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had an intraprocedural <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism, but there were no other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 11.1+/-4.9 months (range, 2 to 17.3 months), patients have had repeat angiography (5) or transcranial Doppler with or without CT angiography (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients have had clinical or significant angiographic restenosis or required target vessel revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elective intracranial stenting with DES appears to be feasible and safe, but additional clinical experience is required to assess its efficacy </plain></SENT>
