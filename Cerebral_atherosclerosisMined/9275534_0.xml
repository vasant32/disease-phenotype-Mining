<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution and severity of arterial lesions of intracranial and extracranial arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 120 consecutive autopsy cases including 100 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (50-80 years) and 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as controls (50-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medium intracranial arteries and their primary branches, small intracerebral arteries, arterioles and extracranial carotid arteries (from 16 cases only) were examined with light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had significantly lower mean LA-VA ratios of the medium sized intracranial arteries and their primary branches, small intracerebral arteries and arterioles than the controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had higher mean VW-VR ratios of these arteries than the controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic narrowing of the medium sized intracranial arteries and their primary branch were more severe than those of the extracranial caotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the proximal portion of the primary branch arteries was much more severe than that of extracranial caotid arteries (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the intracranial medium sized arteries and their primary branches and sclerotic lesions of the small intracerebral arteries and arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These pathological changes resulted in thickening arterial walls and narrowing arterial lumens </plain></SENT>
