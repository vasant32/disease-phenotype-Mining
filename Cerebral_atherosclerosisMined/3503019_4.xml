<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we reviewed 51 cases identified, among 675 consecutive carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A perioperative mortality of 2% and a permanent morbidity rate of 16% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with a complication rate of about 5% previously reported from this institution, this clearly indicates contralateral carotid occlusion as a major risk factor in carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though not statistically significant, patients with severely reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) had suffered more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> when compared to patients with only minor reduction in CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the internal carotid artery blood flow following endarterectomy was significantly higher in the low pressure group (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients were lost during follow-up, for a mean of 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative five-year survival rate was 74%, not significantly different from the expected survival of an age and sex matched population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the period of follow-up 16 patients experienced new neurologic symptoms, in six (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s) referable to the hemisphere ipsilateral to operation and in 10 (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s) referable to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The five-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This together with the observed survival rate indicated a better-than-expected course in this group of patients with severe cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
