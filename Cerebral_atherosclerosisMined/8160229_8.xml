<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although epidemiologic investigations are trying to clarify the role of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations (primarily cholesterol and its subfractions) as risk factors for both ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, little information is available regarding the effect of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> on cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the 133Xe inhalation method in 25 heterozygous patients (four untreated) affected with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients regional CBF was repeated 20 minutes after intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg body wt) to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations among cerebral perfusion data, present or pretreatment plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, and certain other clinical features were assessed by ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both basal regional CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the vast majority of patients compared with age- and sex-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF was significantly dependent on pretreatment <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) concentration (P = .005) and the presence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF was only slightly dependent on age (P = .05) and was not dependent on either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) or present <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF did not differ between treated and untreated patients, and the perfusional increase induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was not related to any other variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral perfusion and cerebrovascular reactivity were maintained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range despite long-lasting, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, even if a somewhat lower CBF was found in those patients with the highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> pretreatment levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are in accord with the epidemiologic data that implicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> as a minor risk factor, if a risk factor at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
