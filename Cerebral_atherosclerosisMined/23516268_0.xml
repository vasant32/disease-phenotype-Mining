<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the role of a learning curve in the safety and outcome of Wingspan stenting from the experience of 95 consecutive patients at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study the endpoints were major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;3) within 30 days, other neurological complications, technical procedural problems, technical success in completion of angioplasty and stenting and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the corresponding vascular territory after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data splitting into quarters was used for learning curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The periprocedural major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 4.2% (4/95), minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 5.3% (5/95), total 9.5% (9/95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical procedural problem rate was 11.6% (11/95) and the technical success rate was 93.7% (89/95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 89 patients were followed for 38.9Â±22.7 months (median 40.8, range 0.2-72, 3463 patient-months) after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the corresponding vascular territory was 0.7% per patient per year (2/3463 patient-months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Guidewire- or angioplasty-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was the major cause of periprocedural major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3/4, 75%) and did not occur in the last quarter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was uncommon and perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There may be a learning curve for mastering the safety precautions of Wingspan stenting for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
