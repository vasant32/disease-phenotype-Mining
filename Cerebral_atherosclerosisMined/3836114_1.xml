<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of flunarizine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and lipidic patterns in rabbits with dietary experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it is well known that there is only a slight correlation between the severity of atheromatous lesions ascertained at necroscopy and the severity of clinical symptoms of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, the effect of the drug was assessed by measuring the CBF and compartmental distribution of blood flow in unanaesthetized rabbits by the intracarotid Xe-133 clearance method; blood pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and tissue fat infiltration were also checked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An atherogenic diet brings about significant impairment of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flunarizine is inactive in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits if chronically administered at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In atherosclerotic rabbits <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with flunarizine induced a pronounced increase in cerebral haemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial pressure and blood pCO2 were not significantly modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lipidic patterns were not markedly improved by flunarizine treatment in comparison with values for atherosclerotic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that flunarizine treatment counteracts the haemodynamic effects of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pronounced activity on the cerebral vessels is accompanied by a weak antilipaemic effect </plain></SENT>
