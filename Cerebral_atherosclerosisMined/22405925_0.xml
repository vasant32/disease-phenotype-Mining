<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the immunolocalization of 14-3-3 proteins in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of human cerebral and carotid arteries using 14-3-3 isoform-specific antibodies to distinguish 7 isoforms, and confirmed the cell type localization using double immunofluorolabeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>14-3-3 common (COM)-like immunoreactivity (IR) was intense, mainly in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> and multinucleated giant cells of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The beta, gamma, epsilon, tau, eta, and zeta (6/7) isoform-specific antibodies showed similar results to those with anti-14-3-3 COM antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, among these isoform-specific antibodies, the anti-eta isoform antibody most intensely immunolabeled multinucleated giant cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>, and the anti-zeta isoform antibody most intensely immunolabeled infiltrating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), in carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zeta IR was also observed in one part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> and in the nuclei of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gamma isoform-like IR was relatively limited in cell components, but extracellular lesions were partly positive for this isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the main cerebral arteries, the anti-epsilon isoform antibody most intensely immunolabeled infiltrating VSMCs in the intima of thickened fibrous cap plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells were also positive for the epsilon isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may provide a basis for understanding the isoform-specific role associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the cerebral and carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
