<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient died of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 5 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination of the inflated middle cerebral arteries revealed heterogeneously extended walls and dilated lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Throughout the vessel walls, the extracellular matrix, which was composed of nonmuscle components such as increased collagen, was stretched in conjunction with the medial muscle component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, torn and thinned areas of the wall and intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were caused by overinflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient died of massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by diffuse vasospasm 5 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prominent stretching of the walls at the atheromatous plaque margin in the dilated vessel was found in addition to the morphological changes observed in the first patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that characteristic pathological alterations might be present in the vessel wall at the site of angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major mechanism of the long-lasting effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> seems to be the stretching and disruption of both the degenerative muscle and the proliferative nonmuscle components, mainly in the media of the vasospastic vessels </plain></SENT>
