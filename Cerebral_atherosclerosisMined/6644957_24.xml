<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 108 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, healthy volunteers; 84 had risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of both risk and nonrisk groups, 75 were habitual smokers (0.5 to 3.5 packs per day for 25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of mean Fg values for both hemispheres showed significant reductions related to tobacco consumption and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple-regression equations using smoking, age, risk, and alcohol consumption indicated a combined R2 value of 0.22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoking seems to be a potent risk factor decreasing cerebral blood flow probably by enhancing cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> cigarette smoking in persons with other risk factors further reduced Fg values in an additive manner when compared with subjects who had corresponding risk factors who did not smoke </plain></SENT>
