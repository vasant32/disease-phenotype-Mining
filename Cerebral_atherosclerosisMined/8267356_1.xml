<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), compared to conventional cerebral and carotid angiography (CA), 45 patients underwent MRA within one week after CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MRA involves a FISP (fast imaging steady precession) pulse sequence base on three-dimensional time-of-flight phenomena at 1.0 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repetition time of 35-40 msec, echo time of 7-11 msec and a flip angle of 15-25 degrees were used to optimise the depiction of blood flow as high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volume data were then submitted to a maximum intensity projection programme and viewed at multiple arbitrary projection angles rotating through the three orthogonal planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous structures were suppressed with a presaturation slab superior to the area of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> significant stenoses and occlusions at the carotid bifurcation and circle of Willis were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other than the carotid siphon (61.4%), the rest of the arteries have above 70% complete agreement between MRA and CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The carotid bifurcation and basilar artery show complete agreement of 75.4% and 76.2% respectively, making MRA a simple sensitive screening procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography has an important role in the evaluation of blood flow in the head and neck regions </plain></SENT>
