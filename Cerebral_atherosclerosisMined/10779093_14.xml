<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the relation of sonographically determined carotid intima-media wall thickness to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations in asymptomatic, healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-five male and female untreated subjects (mean age 49 years, range 22-75) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentrations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution duplex sonography was used to determine intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromotography with fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean intima-media thickness (+/- SD) was 0.78 +/- 0.19 mm (range 0.5-1.35) and mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was 10.5 +/- 2.81 micromol/l (range 5.7-19.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In stepwise regression models, statistically significant predictors of intima-media thickness included age, body mass index, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (R2 = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was independently associated with intima-media thickness after adjustment for the other variables (P &lt; 0.001) and explained an additional 18% of the variation of intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, high-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations are associated with an increased prevalence of carotid artery wall thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of the contribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> to the variation of carotid intima-media thickness, even at concentrations previously believed to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggests a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> as an independent risk factor for early carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
