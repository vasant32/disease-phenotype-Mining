<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its significant activity in decreasing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">pre-beta-lipoproteins</z:chebi> and increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39025">alpha-lipoproteins</z:chebi> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time plafibride inhibited platelet aggregation by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of plafibride was compared to those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3750">clofibrate</z:chebi> and the inactive placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar experiment was carried out with 44 geriatric patients comparing the clinico-therapeutic and biochemical benefits of plafibride in relation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3750">clofibrate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
