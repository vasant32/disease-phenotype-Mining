<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to compare a microsatellite polymorphism (PM) of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and control population, and to assess the relationship between this PM and plaque structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients referring to vascular diagnostic centers for suspected carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (at ultrasound examination: 110 positive, 40 negative) and controls (n=110) have been genotyped for MMP-9 PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After controlling for risk factors, allelic and genotype frequencies were significantly different among the groups, with significant prevalence of long microsatellites in patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long microsatellites (settled as 22 to 27 repeats) were associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 5.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9 to 9.2), compared with controls; an independent case control study on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> confirmed such result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, long microsatellites in MMP-9 PM and smoking habits were variables accounting for the difference between ultrasound-positive patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long microsatellites were also associated to plaques with thin fibrous cap and echolucent core (OR, 13.1; 95% CI, 1.6 to 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These alleles were slightly more represented in female patients (chi2 test=0.019; OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6) but not associated with other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma MMP-9 levels were related neither to MMP-9 PM nor to plaque type, and were related to gender and extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of repeats (&gt; or =22 CA) in the microsatellite of MMP-9 promoter, but not MMP-9 plasma levels, is associated to carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and particularly to plaques with a thin fibrous cap </plain></SENT>
