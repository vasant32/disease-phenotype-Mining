<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is a common location of intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is relatively more peripherally located and of a smaller caliber, and could therefore be a site technically more challenging and risky for angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome, restenosis rate, and procedural safety of Wingspan stent placement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> compared with stenosis in other arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent Wingspan stent placement for symptomatic intracranial stenosis of ≥70% (or stenosis of ≥50% for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> despite medical therapy) were recruited prospectively and allocated into a study group (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, n=35) and a control group (other stenosis, n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the following: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 1 year, and 2) significant in-stent restenosis rate at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the following: 1) periprocedural complications within 24 hours, rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> during the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate within 30 days; and 2) the inability to complete the procedure due to technical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of study group versus the control group were the following: degree of stenosis, 78.4 ± 10.9% versus 72.5 ± 11.2% (P value=.0456); diameter of stenosis, 0.6 ± 0.3 versus 1.0 ± 0.5 mm (P=.0017); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 1 year, 14.3% versus 12% (OR=1.22); in-stent restenosis rate at 1 year, 10% versus 10.5% (OR=1.05); periprocedural complication rate at 24 hours, 2.9% versus 4% (OR=0.70); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> rate during the procedure, 8.6% versus 4% (OR=2.25); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 30 days, 5.7% versus 12% (OR=0.44); and technical failure rate, 2.9% versus 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there were no significant differences in procedural safety, patient outcome, and restenosis rates of stent placement between the group with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and the group with stenoses located at other sites </plain></SENT>
