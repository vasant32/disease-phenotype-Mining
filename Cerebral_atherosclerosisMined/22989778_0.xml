<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may be the underlying pathology in up to 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, but may account for about 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in some populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After an ischemic event determined by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, patients have a 12% annual risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, mostly during the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate procedural safety, clinical outcome and restenosis rate of Wingspan stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one caucasoid patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Target patients were affected by high-grade, symptomatic, intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, were on antithrombotic therapy and at high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the Wingspan stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success resulted 100%, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> target lesions being reduced to &lt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were observed at 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean percent of stenosis was reduced from a middle value of 84% to a middle value of 17% after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medium follow-up was 19.5months (range 6-36months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients presented a &lt;50% stent patency rate at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The short-term results and follow up analysis provide evidence demonstrating the safety of the Wingspan system when used in high-risk patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Due to concerns regarding long-term stent patency and ischemic events occurrence emerged from clinical trials such as the SAMMPRIS, intracranial angioplasty and stent with the Wingspan system should be considered only for high risk patients in which it may be considered the only viable therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
