<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the serial changes of platelet activation in atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured serially platelet expression of CD63 and P-selectin and platelet aggregability to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made 24 and 72 h and 7 and 90 days after the ischemic event in 29 patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregability was significantly decreased after 72 h compared to that at 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, platelet CD63 and P-selectin expression remained high even 90 days after the events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that platelet hyperactivation in atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may be sustained for a considerable period </plain></SENT>
