<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The authors determined the technical success and the clinical and angiographic results of angioplasty and/or stent placement for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) at a tertiary-care referral hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiographic and clinical outcomes occurring within the 1-month follow-up interval were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for a mean period of 20.5 +/- 9.2 months, and a neurovascular imaging study was performed in 18 of the 21 patients alive after a mean period of 19.7 +/- 9.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-free survival and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prevention rates were estimated using Kaplan Meier analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean age = 61.0 +/- 13.5 years; 15 were men) underwent 30 procedures for treatment of ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedures included angioplasty (n = 18) and attempted primary stent placement (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 procedures, angioplasty was performed in the same session after unsuccessful stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was immediate stenosis reduction (mean +/- SD) from 84% +/- 17% to 27% +/- 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 1-month composite rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was 7% for the 30 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival at 36 months was estimated as 79% (95% confidence interval, 57%-91%), and the ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prevention rate was estimated to be 87% (95% confidence interval, 65%-95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 15 patients who underwent repeat angiography, restenosis requiring second intervention was observed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No restenosis could be identified in 3 patients who underwent computed tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This single-center study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness (for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention) of angioplasty and/or stent placement for treatment of ICAD </plain></SENT>
