<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Smoking is a risk factor for increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) 4 allele has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, but the role of apoE in regard to intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) has remained controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to investigate whether there is some gene-environment interaction between smoking and apoE polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN Cross-sectional case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e> of 511 hypertensive and control men were measured ultrasonographically and the apoE genotypes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotypes with the 4 allele were pooled into one group and the genotypes without it into another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant interaction between the 4 allele and smoking affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was observed among the hypertensive smokers, as assessed by analysis of covariance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly greater (1.01 versus 0.90 mm, P = 0.003) in the 4 carriers than in the subjects without 4 among the hypertensive smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of plaques was also significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the other subjects (hypertensive non-smokers or controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis indicated that the 4 allele was an independent determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the hypertensive smokers but not in the other subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated average effect of the 4 allele on the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the hypertensive smokers was 0.088 mm (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the oldest age group, the interaction of smoking and 4 was also seen in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the 4 carriers are particularly susceptible to the atherogenic effects of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This interaction is particularly clear in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
