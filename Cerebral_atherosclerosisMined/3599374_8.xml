<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Changes in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) in the past 20 years have been observed in workers in the city and residents in rural areas and the risk factors of CHD studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings show that the incidence of CHD in the residents in rural areas has hardly changed, and remains still low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of CHD in workers in the city has recently shown a tendency to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a study of CHD risk factors shows that in the rural areas residents <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has a strong influence on the incidence of CHD, while the role of serum total cholesterol is weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the city workers a high serum total cholesterol has become a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it appears that the incidence of CHD caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> are mixed in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present it appears that the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is becoming weaker, while the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> is becoming stronger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting balance between them may be expressed as a rise and fall of CHD in Japan at present </plain></SENT>
