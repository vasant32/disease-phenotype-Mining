<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presently, there is no consensus on how pulse pressure should be measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distensibility of the left and right common carotid arteries was measured noninvasively in 224 patients participating in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was recorded every 4 min, using a semiautomatic oscillometric device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distensibility coefficients (DC) were calculated with pulse pressure obtained as an average of (A) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements during the session; (B) the second, third, and fourth measurement; (C) measurements before and after distensibility assessment; and (D) three measurements nearest to distensibility assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> with the four calculated DCs were evaluated with linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DC estimates were slightly more precise with methods A and B than with C or D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the associations showed a slight trend to higher precision for methods A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulse pressures obtained as an average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or the second, third, and fourth blood pressure measurements during an arterial stiffness measurement session yield slightly more precise estimates of DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the differences between the methods are small; therefore, we suggest that pragmatic arguments dominate the choice between the methods </plain></SENT>
