<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the velocity and direction of the flow, flowing blood has a variable appearance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rapidly flowing blood which runs perpendicular to the imaging plane shows no signal (high velocity signal loss) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slow laminar flow has a stronger signal to the adjacent tissue when blood vessels run perpendicular to the imaging plane (flow related enhancement), and so when blood vessels course within the imaging plane (even echo rephasing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering these phenomena, we attempted to evaluate the occluded arteries in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occluded arteries showed high signal intensities both on T1 and T2 weighted images in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few cases whose occluded arteries had recanalized on angiography showed no signal in both images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that the occluded site of internal carotid, middle cerebral or basilar artery could be identified on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, atherosclerotic middle cerebral arteries showed double linear high intensities along the arterial walls on both images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculated that these high intensities represented atherosclerotic plaque, slow laminar flow or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> along the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging could depict <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, slow flow and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
