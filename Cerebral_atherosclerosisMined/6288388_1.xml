<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>48 patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were found to have a manifest release of adenylate kinase (AK) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This release was most probably due to an increased leak in the brain cells subsequent to a lowered adenylate charge potential followed by a diminished electrochemical potential in these cells suffering from disturbed oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further increase of AK release into CSF was noted for the 22 patients receiving cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> compared to the 26 patients not treated with these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean AK value of the former group was 0.119 +/- 0.028 U/l compared to that of the latter group, being 0.089 +/- 0.025 U/l, and this difference was significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> is most probably explained by an additional lowering of the membrane electrochemical potential in brain cells of these patients due to the direct action of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>- and K+-dependent ATPase system in these cells, resulting in an increased leak in the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
