<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has been previously postulated as a possible etiology for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies, however, have suggested a relatively low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in Parkinsonian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of extra- and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed carotid duplex studies and transcranial Doppler (TCD) examinations in 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> and in 50 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid duplex scanning results revealed fewer Parkinsonian patients with stenotic lesions (30% versus 38% in the control group; p=0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TCD results demonstrated lower peak flow velocities in the Parkinsonian group versus the control group, and these differences were statistically significant in the basilar, vertebral and right middle cerebral arteries (p=0.03, 0.001 and 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The carotid duplex scanning results could not provide a potential explanation for the relatively low occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Parkinsonian patients, because most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are related to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> while the TCD results might reflect a diminished blood supply secondary to a decline in tissue metabolism </plain></SENT>
