<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physical and hemodynamic properties of the lesion are determined by the experience of the clinician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized analysis may provide more accurate values of these parameters which can be used during the procedure for improving patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case of a 55-year-old man who was having ischemic symptoms related to severe middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intralesional stent placement normalized the diameter of the vessel leading to cessation of the episodes of neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Discussants include a neurointerventionist, a neurovascular image analyst, and a neurovascular flow and hemodynamic analyst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Questions discussed included qualitative and quantitative analysis of stenosis; comparison of angiographic perfusion studies including analysis of delay in opacification, transit times and time density curves; role of automation in analysis of "emboli tolerance" and "no re-flow" phenomenon; and relationship of compliance and recoil in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased segments of a vessel during angioplasty or stent placement </plain></SENT>
