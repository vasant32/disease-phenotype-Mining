<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose the Doppler audio spectra as recorded in asymptomatic volunteers with an ATL Duplex scanner (relatively large sample volume) and a multi-gate pulsed Doppler system (relatively small sample volume) were compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volunteers, randomly selected from the population registers, varied in age from 20-69 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only in the common carotid artery at younger age, were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spectra recorded, especially with the multi-gate system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the internal carotid artery the number of spectra, supposed to be associated with low grade stenosis, increased significantly, especially when recorded with the Duplex scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More pronounced spectral broadening was found when the spectra were recorded distally in this artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cervical carotid arteries <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spectra were found only when sampled in the middle of the bloodstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that for the detection of vascular lesions in the cervical carotid arteries at an early stage of the disease on the basis of spectral broadening, small sample volumes and sampling in the centre of the vessel are required </plain></SENT>
