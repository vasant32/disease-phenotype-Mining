<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the most elderly (90 years of age and above) is only modestly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that other, as yet unknown, disease processes may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in this rapidly growing demographic group, and that efforts designed to combat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> may not be appropriate for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in very elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study this question more closely, we examined the relationship between neocortical Alzheimer-type brain pathology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in consecutive autopsies from 209 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of the effect of ageing on cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost half of the cohort was older than 90 years of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that several measures of neocortical Alzheimer's pathology, including the Consortium to Establish a Registry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> neuritic plaque score and the Braak neurofibrillary tangle score, remained significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In participants older than 90 years of age, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> emerged as an important predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects with low Alzheimer's pathology scores, but did not mitigate the importance or population attributable risk of high Alzheimer's pathology scores on the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was evidence that the threshold score for neurofibrillary pathology to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> increased in the oldest subjects, but this was offset by an overall increase in neurofibrillary pathology in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> pathology remains significantly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the most elderly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> also emerged as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in subjects with low Alzheimer's pathology scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for a significant number of elderly subjects having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> without an apparent cause </plain></SENT>
