<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated variation in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes - interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-10, IL-18, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) superfamily [lymphotoxin(LT)-alpha, TNF-alpha, LT-beta] - with respect to nonfatal incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A population-based case-control study recruited postmenopausal and/or hypertensive Group Health members aged 30-79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We chose a subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to describe common gene-wide variation on the basis of linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>36 SNPs, describing 38 common haplotypes for 5 genes and a 3-gene cluster, were genotyped among 856 MI cases, 368 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, and 2688 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations of SNPs or PHASE-inferred haplotypes and risk were estimated using logistic regression; significance of gene-level associations was assessed with global Wald tests and permutation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene-wide IL-18 variation was associated with higher MI risk and an IL-1B haplotype was associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In secondary analyses of SNPs, we observed associations of several IL-1B polymorphisms with risk of MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-6, CRP, IL-10, and TNF superfamily gene variation was not associated with MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support prior reports associating an IL-18 gene variant and MI risk, contribute additional evidence to reports of IL-1B and cardiovascular risk, and fail to confirm risk differences previously observed for CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha promoter variants </plain></SENT>
