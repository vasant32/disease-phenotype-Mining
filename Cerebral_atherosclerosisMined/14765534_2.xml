<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND RELEVANCE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is responsible for 70,000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> each year in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive testing such as transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to identify intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is in widespread use, but has not been rigorously validated against the gold standard, catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recently NIH-funded <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial will compare <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with aspirin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WASID requires performance of angiography along with TCD and MRA, providing an opportunity to critically evaluate these noninvasive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcomes and Neuroimaging of Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (SONIA) study is to develop the noninvasive diagnosis of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of SONIA is to define velocity values on TCD and anatomic abnormalities on MRA that identify severe (50-99%) intracranial stenosis of large, proximal arteries seen on catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SONIA will define the criteria, or 'cutpoints', for an abnormal TCD or MRA and show that they perform with a reliable positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: SONIA will be conducted in collaboration with WASID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study-wide cutpoints defining positive TCD and MRA have been developed and reviewed by the site investigators of WASID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hard copy angiography, TCD and MRA generated in WASID will be centrally read in SONIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD and MRA cutpoints seek to achieve a target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 80% for the identification of severe intracranial stenosis on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Central readings will be used to validate the cutpoints and to develop measures of negative predictive value, and inter- and intra-observer variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity will be determined after adjustment for verification bias and employed in receiver-operator characteristic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SONIA will use these techniques to develop TCD and MRA cutpoints that minimize the clinical consequences of test errors occurring in the noninvasive evaluation of patients with suspected intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
