<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Free fatty acids (FFAs), an important energy substrate, have an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, myocardial dysfunction and abnormal cardiac rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited reports are available on the association between FFAs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that plasma FFA concentration could be associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, emphasizing the relationship between FFA and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study examined the association between FFA concentration and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> from a hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data of 715 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of FFA was highest in the cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype compared with the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that an increase in FFA concentration was significantly associated with the cardioembolic subtype after the adjustment of covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FFA concentration was also higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) than those without AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the presence of atherosclerotic stenosis, no significantly difference of FFA concentration was found for intracranial and extracranial cerebral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Here we report a significant association between fasting FFA concentration and the cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF is suggested as the mediating factor between FFA and the cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
