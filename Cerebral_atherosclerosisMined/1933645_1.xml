<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three of the 12 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> related to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions were not evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients were cases of atherosclerotic occlusion and the remaining patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the occluded M1 portions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> the flow void was absent and there were isointense linear structures, with or without a hyperintense component in the Sylvian vallecula, on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For nine of the 12 patients, the absence of flow void in the ipsilateral Sylvian fissure was evident on the T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, even in cases with no evidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, the presence of flow void in the Sylvian vallecula and Sylvian fissure must be searched for in routine reviews of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging can be obtained on an emergency basis, appropriate interventional therapy may be immediately initiated </plain></SENT>
