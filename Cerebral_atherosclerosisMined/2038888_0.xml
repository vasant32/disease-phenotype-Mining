<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data of both groups were compared statistically and also compared with data of former investigations conducted with 10 healthy elderly volunteers and 10 patients who suffered from cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> with serious disorder of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-walking</z:e> rhythm (HA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most pathological EEG deviations are found in the MID-patients, but there is no significant distinction compared to the DAT-patients, although three of the latter showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the HA the EEGs of the MID-patients differed more from those of the healthy volunteers; however, the physiological circadian variations were not leveled as in the HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even in consideration of daytime dependent fluctuations of frequency-parameters, a clear-cut discrimination between DAT and MID by means of the EEG seems impossible </plain></SENT>
