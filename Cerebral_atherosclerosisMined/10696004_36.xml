<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The safe performance of percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> requires that the risk of complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion or symptomatic dissection, and restenosis be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and short-term arteriographic and clinical outcome of cerebral angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for intracranial vertebrobasilar and distal internal carotid atherosclerotic occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1998 and November 1998, 10 patients with 12 intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the vertebrobasilar artery and the distal internal carotid artery underwent treatment with flexible balloon-expandable coronary stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although in two of the 10 patients CAS was not successful because of the inability to access the site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, 10 lesions in eight patients were successfully dilated with stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred during or after the procedure and no neurologic ischemic events or restenoses occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS appears to be a safe and effective means for treating intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e>, yielding a favorable arteriographic and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
