<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the long-term outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with concurrent intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> using magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients in Hong Kong with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was studied with magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and carotid duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up regularly for the development of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cardiac events, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Totally 343 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were included, of whom 104 (30%) had concurrent intracranial and extracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was up to 76 months (mean 44.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 55 patients (15.5%) died of any cause and 91 patients (26.5%) suffered a further nonfatal vascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year cumulative rates of mortality, restroke and poor outcomes (combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and further vascular events) were 18, 27 and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with concurrent lesions, these rates were 31, 41 and 51%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corresponding rates were 13, 22 and 31% in patients without concurrent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risks were highest in the first year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (log rank, 16.3; p = 0.0001), restrokes (log rank, 9.71; p = 0.002) and poor outcomes (log rank, 13.87; p = 0.0001) were found among patients with concurrent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of concurrent vascular lesions, advanced age, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were independent predictors of poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of intracranial and extracranial vessels is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They are at high risk of further vascular events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
