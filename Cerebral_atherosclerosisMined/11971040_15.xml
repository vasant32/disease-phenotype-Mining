<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the extent of white matter high intensity lesions (WML) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an independent predictor of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, and whether serial evaluation of WML can be used to identify patients who are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective follow up with serial MRI scans was done in 89 patients who were either diagnosed as having symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free, neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None had significant stenosis of major cerebral arteries or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was used to test the predictive value for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of risk factor status at entry and during follow up, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, and the extent of WML (scored from 0 to 16) on the baseline scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow up (mean (SD), 51 (19) months), seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred (five lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and two haemorrhages): four in nine patients with severe WML (score 9-16), and three in 40 patients with mild WML (score 1-8) (log-rank test; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of 40 patients without WML experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of WML was an independent predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (relative risk for a 1 point score increase, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.54; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> among 80 patients without severe WML, two occurred in four patients with an increase in WML score during follow up, and one occurred in the other 76 patients without an increased score (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe WML at baseline is an independent predictor of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, while progression of WML during follow up may be associated with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with initially mild WML </plain></SENT>
