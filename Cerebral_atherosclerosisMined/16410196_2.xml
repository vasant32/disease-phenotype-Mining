<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the relationship between stiffening and thickening of the large arteries might lead to optimal strategies for the prevention of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few investigations of the correlation between carotid artery wall thickening and arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relationship between arterial stiffness (assessed by the ankle-brachial pulse wave velocity) and carotid plaque (detected by high-resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonography) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> aged 40-80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six subjects had carotid plaque (27 had low-grade plaques (plaque score&lt;7.0) and 29 had high-grade plaques (plaque score &gt;or=7.0)) and 53 subjects did not have plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High pulse wave velocity was found to be significantly associated with existence of carotid plaque (p&lt;0.001), but was not associated with the severity of the plaque (p=0.14) in multivariate logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the pulse wave velocity is associated with the existence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but not with the severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
