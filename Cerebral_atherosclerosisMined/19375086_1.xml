<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current data concerning the association between family history and the risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been very little data on the influence of family history on intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and recovery, especially among Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between family history and the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and investigated the relationships between family history and ICAS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, we recruited 400 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, along with the same number of age- and gender-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessments of first-degree family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were obtained by structured questionnaires, followed by reviews of the clinical and neuro-radiological findings of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.75 to 4.01), and the correlation remained significant after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of paternal, maternal, and sibling history were 2.07, 2.16, and 4.21, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not differ significantly with the presence of ICAS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive sibling history was more strongly correlated with the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than a positive parental history, and this finding may indicate the possible role of environmental factors in a shared household in addition to the genetic factors involved in family medical history </plain></SENT>
