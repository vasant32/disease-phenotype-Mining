<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This confirms previous morphological observations that the severity and extent of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are greater in American Negros than in American Caucasians and aftricans </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemical quantitation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in vessels may be utilized for assessment of degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and may prove to be an acceptable and reliable alternative methodology for epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
