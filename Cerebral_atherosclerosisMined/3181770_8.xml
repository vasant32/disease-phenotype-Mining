<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were healthy volunteers without any past history of cerebral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rCBF decreased significantly with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in rCBF between young smokers and nonsmokers, elderly smokers showed significantly lower rCBF than elderly nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in vital capacity and FEV 1.0% between smokers and nonsmokers in both young and elderly groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The smokers, however, showed significantly lower V50 than the nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PeCO2 in smokers was significantly lower than in nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in hematocrit, antithrombin III, aggregating platelet, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and blood pressure between smokers and nonsmokers in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly positive correlation between rCBF and PeCO2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-term smoking may reduce rCBF by means of <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, resulting from latent small airway disturbances, not by advancing cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
