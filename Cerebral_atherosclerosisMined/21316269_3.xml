<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the importance of the shear-stress-sensitive calcium channels Trpc1, Trpm7, Trpp2, Trpv2 (transient receptor potential <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel, subfamily V, member 2) and Trpv4 for cerebral arteriogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles were analysed, comparing the stimulation of collateral growth by target-specific drugs to that achieved by maximum increased fluid shear stress (FSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, controlled study wherein rats were subjected to bilateral carotid artery ligature (BCL), or BCL + <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo>, or BCL + drug application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">Messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) abundance and protein expression were determined in FSS-stimulated cerebral collaterals by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drugs were applied via osmotic mini pumps and arteriogenesis was evaluated by post-mortem angiograms and Ki67 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Trpv4 was the only mechanosensitive Trp channel showing significantly increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance and protein expression after FSS stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of Trpv4 by 4α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12,13-didecanoate caused significantly enhanced collateral growth (length: 4.43 ± 0.20 mm and diameter: 282.6 ± 8.1 μm) compared with control (length: 3.80 ± 0.06 mm and diameter: 237.3 ± 5.3 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drug application stimulated arteriogenesis to almost the same extent as did maximum FSS stimulation (length: 4.61 ± 0.07 mm and diameter: 327.4 ± 12.6 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trpv4 showed significantly increased expression in FSS-stimulated cerebral collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological Trpv4 activation enhanced cerebral arteriogenesis, pinpointing Trpv4 as a possible candidate for the development of new therapeutic concepts </plain></SENT>
