<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) for the distal vertebral and basilar artery is now being performed in selected patients with haemodynamically significant lesions of the posterior cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effect and overall results were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> catheter specifically developed for these procedures, with a 2.0-3.5 mm balloon diameter, at 6 atmospheres of pressure, was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed in 12 patients (including six whose initial results have been reported) with angiographically documented stenotic lesions involving either the intracranial vertebral artery (C1-C2 portion) or the basilar artery, and satisfying the following criteria: (1) clinical symptoms suggestive or consistent with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> refractory to medical treatment, or small infarction of the posterior circulation; and (2) angiographically documented stenosis greater than 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of 12 patients had complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the distal vertebral and basilar artery and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed after successful intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful results, without complications, were obtained in eight patients, with complete resolution of vertebrobasilar ischaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate complications occurred in four patients including two with vessel dissection, and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> were reoperated but developed small infarctions with permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two patients with thromboembolic complication showed transient neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall stenosis ratio decreased from a mean of 84% pretreatment to 44% after the angioplasty procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restenosis occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long term clinical follow up in 11 patients who survived more than six months showed resolution of ischaemic symptoms after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except for one with a restenosis who had recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transluminal angioplasty may be an effective procedure to treat vertebrobasilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> secondary to high grade arteriosclerotic disease affecting either the distal vertebral or basilar artery regions that do not respond to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
