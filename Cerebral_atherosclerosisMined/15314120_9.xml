<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of ischaemic events in asymptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To follow up patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (MCAS) to evaluate the long term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in its territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive white patients with asymptomatic atherosclerotic MCAS were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with MCAS of possible or proven non-atherosclerotic origin were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAS was assessed by transcranial colour duplex sonography according to published angiography validated criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was given at the discretion of the treating physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 50 patients were included and followed for (mean (SD)) 815 (351) days; three were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MCAS was &lt; 50% in 38 and &gt; or = 50% in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered an ischaemic event in the MCAS territory; one had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died, one from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> in the contralateral hemisphere, and two from non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment at baseline included antithrombotic drugs in 42 cases (antiplatelet agent, n = 39; <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, n = 3), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in 22; at the end of follow up 45 of the 47 survivors were on antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agent, n = 37; <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, n = 8), and 30 were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic MCAS of atherosclerotic origin appears to have a benign long term prognosis with a low risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated white patients </plain></SENT>
