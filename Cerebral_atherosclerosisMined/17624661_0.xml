<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography to monitor serial changes in steno-occlusive lesions of the major intracranial arteries to elucidate the incidence of progression and investigate the risk factors for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 151 consecutive patients, 78 males and 73 females aged 42-92 years (mean 71.1+/-10.2 years), were followed up by serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for 5-34 months (mean 14.4+/-5.78 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined as increased stenosis or occlusion, or new stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography follow up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, current smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were chosen as risk factors for multiple logistic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three of the patients (15.2%) had progression, caused by total occlusion in 10, increased stenosis in 10, and new stenosis in 3, 15 patients had regression, and 113 patients had no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio: 6.771, p value: 0.0004) and current smoking (odds ratio: 7.574, p value: 0.0019) were determined as significant risk factors for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intracranial steno-occlusive lesion and either <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or smoking habit should be carefully followed up by serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
