<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although carotid and vertebral intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) can lead to both hemodynamic insufficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, its fluid dynamic properties remain undefined because of its intricate features and complex three-dimensional geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis to model the hemodynamics of symptomatic ICAD lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine ICAD lesions (six carotid, two vertebral, one middle cerebral) underwent high-resolution catheter-based digital rotational angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reconstructed three-dimensional volumes of the target lesions were segmented and used to generate hybrid computational meshes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dynamic pulsatile CFD analysis was performed using a non-Newtonian shear-dependent model of blood's viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CFD results revealed complex flow patterns within ICAD lesions with midstenotic shear rates of greater than 19,000/s, sufficiently high to induce high-shear platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vorticity and helicity within the stenoses were followed by sudden deceleration with formation of vortex cores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pressure gradients were significant mostly at greater than 75% stenosis with a mean time-averaged drop of 27.2 +/-17.8 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike the smoothly-varying helicity imparted by the three-dimensional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the intracranial circulation, poststenotic regions of ICAD lesions showed significant and rapidly fluctuating helicity and vorticity patterns, which may contribute to the propagation of platelets activated by the high shear region within the stenosis throat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stent angioplasty restored the hemodynamic profile of ICAD lesions to within contralateral controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient-based symptomatic ICAD lesions studied using CFD analysis appear to harbor a hemodynamically pathological environment that favors the activation, aggregation and distal embolization of platelets and is reversed by endovascular stent angioplasty </plain></SENT>
