<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CT scanning performed before and sequentially during the inhalation of stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> (32%), coupled with end-tidal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> measurements, has made possible the routine construction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) maps with resolution that approximates that of the CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The capability of obtaining quantitative flow maps with direct anatomic correlation is now available with a commercial package of hardware and software adapted to the General Electric 9800 scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability to distinguish between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reduced rCBF in specific vascular territories has proved useful in the management of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Specific clinical dilemmas that have been addressed with rCBF information from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT scanning include the following: In the patient with asymptomatic occlusive disease, is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>Is there adequate collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Are cerebrovascular symptoms a result of emboli or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> regional low flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>In the patient with complex multivessel occlusive disease, which revascularization procedure is indicated first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>Did operation improve rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="?"><plain>Should a further procedure be added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="?"><plain>May a diffusely diseased but patent artery, which is the source of emboli, be sacrificed safely without compromising rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of experience with 155 patients, the management and understanding of cerebrovascular disease has been aided substantially by the incorporation of rCBF mapping by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT scan in the evaluation of these patients </plain></SENT>
