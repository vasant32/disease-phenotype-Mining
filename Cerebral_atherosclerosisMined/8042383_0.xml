<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two former variants are referred to the favorable type of DE course, the rest are considered unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major risk factors in the patients with the favorable and unfavorable patterns of DE were studied, as well as the contribution of these factors to the development of DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In male patients the factors conductive to the development of an unfavorable DE course were psychoemotional stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, the presence of two or more concomitant somatic diseases and the absence of regular therapy; in women such factors were psychoemotional stress, excessive body mass, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the presence of two or more concomitant somatic diseases, and a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A method for predicting the DE course, based on a discriminant analysis of the risk factors, has been developed, that will essentially improve the efficacy of therapeutic and prophylactic measures in such patients </plain></SENT>
