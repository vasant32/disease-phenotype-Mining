<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to investigate plasma and genetic risk factors for rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In London, a case-control study was made of 56 consecutive patients admitted to a regional neurosurgical service for treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> and of 93 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further 40 consecutive patients admitted in Arhus with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> also were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The British case-control study showed that smoking was associated with an increased risk of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 9.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4 to 23.8; P &lt; .001 for a history of &gt; 10 pack years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After age and sex adjustment, factors associated with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> included a cholesterol concentration in the highest tertile (&gt; or = 6.3 mmol/L; odds ratio, 10.2; 95% CI, 3.9 to 26.7; P &lt; .001), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B concentration in the highest tertile (&gt; or = 0.84 g/L; odds ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.5 to 16.3; P &lt; .001), and concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in the lowest tertile (&lt; 1.1 mmol/L; odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 8.2; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was of less importance (odds ratio, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.41 to 11.7; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smoking history (P &lt; .001) and increased concentrations of cholesterol (P &lt; .0001) were the most important independent risk factors associated with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking, together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels, in the Danish patients were similar to those in the British patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the entire patient group, the frequencies of two polymorphic variations in the type III collagen gene and polymorphisms at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> C-III, and haptoglobin gene loci were not different from control subjects or the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population; allele frequencies in British and Danish patients were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An atherosclerotic profile including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>increased total cholesterol</z:hpo> concentration and a long smoking history may contribute to the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides no support for the hypothesis that inherited abnormalities of type III collagen are a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
