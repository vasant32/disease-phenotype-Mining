<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of 10 patients with middle cerebral artery territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain data from patients with presumed in situ middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis, the study excluded patients with a known source of cardiac emboli, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and classical lacunar syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the gold standard for this study, CTA demonstrated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100%), while abnormal TCDs suggesting <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses were found in only six patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stenotic sites differed among patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal TCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with false negative TCDs were found to have more distal lesions (distal M1 or M2 segment) whereas patients with TCD abnormalities tend to have more proximal lesions as demonstrated by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that an abnormal TCD is highly suggestive of stenosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TCD, however, does not exclude such a lesion, especially in patients with distal M1 or M2 stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TCD may not be the best screening test for intracranial vascular stenotic lesion in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
