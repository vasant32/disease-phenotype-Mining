<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was based on the detection of a thin, delayed antegrade trickle of contrast medium distal to an area of extreme stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In six of these cases both direct and indirect noninvasive tests were interpreted as showing total occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case these tests were thought to demonstrate a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bifurcation, and only once were they successful in suggesting the diagnosis of high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these eight patients subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who present with appropriate clinical indications for carotid endarterectomy should undergo angiography even when the noninvasive tests indicate a total occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In such circumstances the angiographic technique should be altered specifically to detect the possible presence of atheromatous pseudoocclusion </plain></SENT>
