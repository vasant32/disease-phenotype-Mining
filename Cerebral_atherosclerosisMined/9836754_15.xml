<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine whether moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the association between plasma homocyst(e)ine and the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study with 140 male controls and 78 male patients with nonfatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, aged between 39 and 82 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels were analyzed in 218 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients were evaluated for cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma level of homocyst(e)ine was higher in cases than in controls (11.8+/-5.6 versus 9.6+/-4.1 micromol/L; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia was significantly higher in cases than in controls (16.7% versus 5.0%; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the logistic regression model, the odds ratio of the highest 5% of homocyst(e)ine levels in control group was 4.17 (95% confidence interval, 3.71 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>71)(P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After additional adjustment for total cholesterol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and age, the odds ratio was 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.95) (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma homocyst(e)ine levels of patients having vessels with 3 or 2 stenosed sites were significantly higher than those of patients having vessels with 1 stenosed site or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels (14.6+/-1.4, 11.0+/-1.4 versus 7.8+/-1.5, 8.9+/-1.4 micromol/L respectively; P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that moderate hyperhomocyst(e)ienemia was significantly associated with the number of stenosed vessels (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and may predict the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
