<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF can remain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> despite severe ICA stenosis, making the benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting difficult to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after surgery, we assessed CBF supplied through the ipsilateral (stenotic) or contralateral ICA individually with a novel hemisphere-selective arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further explored the relationship between CBF and ICA obstruction ratio (OR) acquired with a multislice black-blood imaging sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients with unilateral ICA stenosis (n = 19), conventional bilateral labeling did not reveal interhemispheric differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With unilateral labeling, CBF in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory on the surgical side from the ipsilateral supply (53.7 +/- 3.3 ml/100 g/min) was lower than CBF in the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory from the contralateral supply (58.5 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g/min), although not statistically significant (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory received significant (p = 0.02) contralateral supply (7.0 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g/min), while ipsilateral supply to the contralateral side was not reciprocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After surgery (n = 11), ipsilateral supply to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory increased from 57.3 +/- 5.7 to 67.3 +/- 5.4 ml/100 g/min (p = 0.03), and contralateral supply to the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of increased CBF on the side of surgery was normalized presurgical ipsilateral supply (r(2) = 0.62, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OR was less predictive of change, although the change in normalized contralateral supply was negatively correlated with OR(excess) (=OR(ipsilateral) - OR(contralateral)) (r(2) = 0.58, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate the effect of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on blood supply to the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the relative role of collateral pathways before surgery and redistribution of blood flow through these pathways after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unilateral ASL may better predict hemodynamic surgical outcome (measured by improved perfusion) than ICA OR </plain></SENT>
