<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Overweight in adults is associated with increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the long-term effect of overweight in adolescence on morbidity and mortality is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the relation between overweight and morbidity and mortality in 508 lean or overweight adolescents 13 to 18 years old who participated in the Harvard Growth Study of 1922 to 1935 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overweight adolescents were defined as those with a body-mass index that on two occasions was greater than the 75th percentile in subjects of the same age and sex in a large national survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lean adolescents were defined as those with a body-mass index between the 25th and 50th percentiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects who were still alive were interviewed in 1988 to obtain information about their medical history, weight, functional capacity, and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For those who had died, information on the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overweight in adolescent subjects was associated with an increased risk of mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes and disease-specific mortality among men, but not among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risks among men were 1.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7; P = 0.004) for mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes and 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1; P = 0.002) for mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of morbidity from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was increased among men and women who had been overweight in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> was increased among men and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was increased among women who had been overweight in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overweight in adolescence was a more powerful predictor of these risks than overweight in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overweight in adolescence predicted a broad range of adverse health effects that were independent of adult weight after 55 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
