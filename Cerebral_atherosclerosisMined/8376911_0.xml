<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However early embolic events and recurrent stenosis are, after intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, the main problems of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and therefore technical improvements that reduce the incidence of these complications are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice between primary closure and angioplasty is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of angioplasty, the choice of patching material seems to be important in preventing these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Authors present their experience with a biosynthetic ovine patch in carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the period from January 1982 to November 1991, 1013 carotid endarterectomies were performed on 866 patients (659 men, 207 women) with atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 147 cases a bilateral CEA was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently, in 37 cases of patch angioplasty, the Authors used the biosynthetic ovine patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no permanent neurological deficit were registered in this series either during awakening or the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 37 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except 4, had a minimum follow-up of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases of non-hemodynamic restenosis were detected, one at 6 and one at 12 months; both were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this series the total restenosis ratio was 5.5% (2/36), and the cumulative mortality rate 10.8% (4/37) (IMA 2, hepatic insufficiency 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Authors' preliminary experience with this biosynthetic graft as a patching material has been satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They believe that this biosynthetic graft (Omniflow) on account of its handling and particularly its healing characteristics can be considered as a graft material for patching at the carotid level </plain></SENT>
