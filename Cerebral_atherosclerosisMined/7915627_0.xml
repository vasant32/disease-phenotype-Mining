<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCD assessed accurately the extent of the collateral circulation in 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The haemodynamic effectiveness of EIAB depends on the preoperative state of the collateral circulation; the greatest effect was achieved in patients with the lowest levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EIABs improved the outcome in patients in the present series; hence vascular and neurosurgeons may be persuaded of the benefit of this treatment in patients with unilateral atherosclerotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
