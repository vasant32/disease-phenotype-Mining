<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was established that arteries of the cerebral surface 200-500 micron in diameter were characterized by compensatory-adaptive processes reflecting structural adaptation of the vessels to a prolonged elevation of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracerebral arteries were considerably more frequently characterized by changes induced by hypertonic crises expressed in the form of plasmorrhagias and isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cortico-medullary arteries 100-150 micron in diameter were predominantly affected which accounts for a more severe damage to the cerebral white substance in arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
