<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, little is known about the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms and the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients admitted to our service between 2003 and 2007 were included in the study on the basis of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the cortical "hand knob" area confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with contralateral hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients clinical, epidemiological as well as imaging data at the time point of admission were analysed retrospectively and follow-up data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority (n = 21/72%) had an isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the cortical "hand knob" area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 23 (79%) patients it was a first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (34%) had ipsilateral extracranial stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA), whereas potential cardiac embolic sources were less frequent (n = 4/14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient exhibited ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two patients (93%) had marked atherosclerotic alterations of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most prevalent vascular risk factor (n = 23/79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (mean 25.0 months, range 0.4-47.4 months) no patient had died and only one (3%) experienced a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (79%) reported improvement of hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, 17 (59%) were asymptomatic (modified Rankin score = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was significantly disabled due to a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting the cortical "hand knob" area are frequently associated with atherosclerotic changes of the carotid artery, suggesting an arterio-arterial thrombembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It mostly reflects first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and follow-up data suggest a rather benign course </plain></SENT>
