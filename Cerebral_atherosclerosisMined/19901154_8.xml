<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between a composite measure of serological test results for common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus 1 and 2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort followed up longitudinally for median 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Northern Manhattan Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients Randomly selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free participants from a multiethnic urban community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main Outcome Measure Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 infectious serological results were available from baseline samples in 1625 participants (mean [SD] age, 68.4 [10.1] years; 64.9% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations of each positive serological test result with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual parameter estimates were then combined into a weighted index of infectious burden and used to calculate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for association with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other outcomes, adjusted for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was positively, though not significantly, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk after adjusting for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The infectious burden index was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.90) after adjusting for demographics and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were similar after excluding those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.13) and adjusting for inflammatory biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A quantitative weighted index of infectious burden was associated with risk of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and to further define optimal measures of infectious burden as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
