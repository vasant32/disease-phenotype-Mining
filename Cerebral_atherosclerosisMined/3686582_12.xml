<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clusters of asymptomatic "expanding" lacunes, due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the perivascular spaces, were found in both dentate nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cavities, which presented as space-occupying lesions, were surrounded by a single layer of flattened cells and contained 1 or more sections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-looking arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a topographic grouping of lacunes in the dentate nucleus has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of widening of the perivascular compartment remains unclear; its occurrence in a hypertensive patient and its association with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggest a common pathophysiologic mechanism possibly including an alteration of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
