<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GOALS: This study was designed to determine the relationship between WMHs and cortical volumes in HIV-seropositive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare cortical volumes among 62 HIV-seropositive individuals participating in the Hawaii Aging with HIV Cohort Study, 30 with moderate WMHs and 32 with minimal or no WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Presence of moderate WMHs was associated with decreased cortical volumes in the frontal lobes bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that age-related WMHs are associated with reduced frontal gray matter volumes in HIV-seropositive individuals, supporting the hypothesis that the frontal lobes may have greater susceptibility to the effects of small-vessel ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
