<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the cause of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) atherosclerotic disease in patients with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 123 patients with unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction we performed a case-control autopsy study evaluating the frequency of atherosclerotic plaque and moderate (&lt;70%) or severe (&gt;or=70%) stenosis in the ipsilateral and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical history, risk factors, imaging data and general autopsy reports were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entire cerebral arterial tree was studied pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (either moderate or severe stenosis) was more frequent in the ipsilateral (21.1%, n = 26) than the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (8.1%, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding odds ratio (OR) for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> relative to the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was 6.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.87-21.40] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was found with both moderate (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 1.45-22.76) and severe (OR = 7.18, 95% CI = 1.58-32.73) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> atherosclerotic stenosis may be responsible for parent territorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Novel arterial wall magnetic resonance imaging techniques should now be used to investigate in vivo the hypothesis that moderate <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis is a possible explanation in patients with nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
