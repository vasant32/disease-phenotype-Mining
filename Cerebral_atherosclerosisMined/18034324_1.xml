<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> has recently proven to be associated with the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and inflammatory genes are good candidates for the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> involves the recruitment of inflammatory cells from the circulation and their transendothelial migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This process is mainly mediated by cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule P-selectin may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism of P-selectin gene, which may affect the production level of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, has been associated with a number of atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship of P-selectin gene polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms of P-selectin gene -2,123 G/C, -1,969 G/A, -1,817 T/C and Thr715Pro in three hundred and five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 280 age and sex matched controls, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of P-selectin gene polymorphisms between the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant association of genotype, allele and haplotype at any of the polymorphism in relation to any subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not observe an association between P-selectin gene polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or any subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed to explore the complex interaction between environmental factors and P-selectin gene polymorphisms in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in ethnically different populations </plain></SENT>
