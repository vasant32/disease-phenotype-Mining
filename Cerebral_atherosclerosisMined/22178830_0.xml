<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between interferon-γ(IFN-γ), interleukin-6(IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α(TNF-α) and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and to compare serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines in different cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>arteries stenosis</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the stenotic site, patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>arteries stenosis</z:mp> were divided into intracranial stenosis group (n=26), extracranial stenosis group (n=30), intracranial and extracranial stenosis group (n=27), and group of stenosis in middle cerebral artery (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And there were 33 samples in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood serum IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum IFN-γ and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the stenosis groups (P=0.000) as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But serum IFN-γ level had no significant difference between the two optional stenosis groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And IL-6 level in intracranial stenosis group was lower than those in the other stenosis groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that TNF-α of intracranial stenosis group (P=0.001) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis group (P=0.015) significantly increased as compared with the control group and the other two stenosis groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α are possible to participate in the formation of certain cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
