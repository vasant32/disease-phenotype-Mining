<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusive plaques were located in the coronary arteries and major cerebral arteries as well as in the aorta and iliac vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were characterized by an intense sclerotic reaction to areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> and foam cell accumulation in the intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diet induced a rapid elevation of plasma-free and esterfied cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, and the extent of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was shown to be partially dependent on mean plasma cholesterol concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group of eight dogs were fed a diet identical with the first except for the replacement of 4 per cent hydrogenated coconut oil by 4 per cent safflower oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite receiving the same amounts of dietary cholesterol and fat, this second group of dogs was completely protected from the atherogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> became only slightly elevated and no induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were found at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating thyroid hormone concentrations were similar between the two groups of dogs and the thyroid glands had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
