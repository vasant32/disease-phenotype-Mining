<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had recurrent, carotid territory, neurological symptoms considered haemodynamic in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six had occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow studies confirmed diminished cerebrovascular reserve in six patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five patients (six procedures) angioplasty of the stenosed internal carotid artery was carried out successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With two patients technical difficulty in crossing the stenosis prevented angioplasty and in one patient with bilateral stenosis the procedure was not attempted on the second side because of the severity of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> developed during cannulation of the carotid artery and in another a transient monoparesis developed during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both these haemodynamic complications recovered within ten minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is technically feasible in the management of stenotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> associated with haemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is a technically simple procedure requiring only a brief admission to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, its general application to patients with thromboembolic carotid-territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> will depend on the risk/benefit ratio compared to carotid endarterectomy or to conventional medical treatment </plain></SENT>
