<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate platelet accumulation in carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> semiquantitatively, a dual-tracer technique was applied, using In-111 platelets and Tc-99m human serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this approach, we investigated the ratio of radioactivity in In-111 platelets deposited on the vascular wall to those circulating in the blood pool, platelet accumulation index ( PAI ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 25 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic abnormalities were observed at 34 of 50 carotid bifurcations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean PAI value was significantly higher at the carotid bifurcations with angiographic abnormality than at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elevations of mean PAI were prominent at the lesions with severe stenosis or ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of platelet accumulation was well demonstrated by this technique, which can also yield information on thrombogenicity and efficiency of antiplatelet therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid atherosclerotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
