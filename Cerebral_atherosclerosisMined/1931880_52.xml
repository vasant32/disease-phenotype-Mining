<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used data from a registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid arteries to compare the extent of CAD (number of major coronary vessels with 50% or greater stenosis as judged by a consensus interpretation) with the extent of extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred thirty-four patients (234 men, 200 women) greater than 40 years of age were stratified by gender and then divided into quartiles on the basis of a B-mode score that was derived by summing arterial wall thickness at nine sites in the left and nine sites in the right carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of extent of CAD for the four B-mode quartiles showed that men in the lowest B-mode quartile were over six times more likely to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries than three- to four-vessel CAD, while men in the highest B-mode quartile were over 10 times more likely to have three- to four-vessel CAD than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings were similar for women but not as dramatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific discriminant function models using traditional risk factors alone or in combination with B-mode score were developed to predict the extent of CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
