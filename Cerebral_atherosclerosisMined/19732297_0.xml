<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) is a noninvasive imaging modality that provides anatomic and physiologic measurements of arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used QMRA to assess hemodynamic changes following Wingspan stent placement for intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with Wingspan stents for intracranial stenosis who had baseline and follow-up QMRA data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared volumetric flow rates (VFRs) (mL/minute) pre- and poststenting using paired t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P&lt;.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 9 patients (mean age 65.8 years, mean 71% degree of stenosis), lesions were located in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries in 3, middle cerebral arteries in 3, and intracranial vertebrobasilar arteries in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VFR and degree of stenosis were moderately correlated (r=-.670, P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean VFR in the stenotic artery increased from 81.2 mL/minute to 133.3 mL/minute (P=.020) or by 64.2% after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total cerebral blood flow, flow in nonstented vessels, and collateral flow in circle of Willis vessels did not significantly change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that QMRA is a promising noninvasive method for the measurement of cerebral hemodynamics following intracranial Wingspan stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings </plain></SENT>
