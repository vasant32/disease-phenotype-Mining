<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present long-term clinical and duplex data from high-risk patients with severe, recurrent symptomatic stenoses of the vertebrobasilar circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that despite the greater risk of periprocedural complications in this patient group, interventional treatment would reduce the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> relative to the expected natural risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also predicted that the long-term treatment outcome would be positively influenced by the use of stents and by the periprocedural technical success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of our patient data base yielded 45 cases of stenosis of the vertebrobasilar circulation treated endovascularly in 42 patients between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and vascular diagnostic tests, both periinterventionally and during follow-up, were performed independently by experienced neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical success rate was 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stents were used in 67% of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 30 days, 24% of the patients showed post-procedural clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After an average period of 26.3 months, 17.8 % of the patients had deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>11.1% of the patients suffered severe permanent damage as a result of the procedure (mRs 3 - 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was found in 9.5% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For this population of high-risk patients with recurrently symptomatic intracranial stenoses of the vertebrobasilar axis, endovascular treatment reduced the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> relative to the expected natural risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of stents had no significant effect on the long-term results </plain></SENT>
