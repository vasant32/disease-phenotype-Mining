<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approved this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms who are scheduled to have brain MRI were recruited on a voluntary basis. electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated helical CT scans were used to determine the arterial calcium as a reliable index of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial arterial calcium content was measured quantitatively by special software available in our CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial calcium was graded qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was independently evaluated to identify cortical, central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relationship between CT demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cerebral ischemic changes, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> patterns were evaluated both without and with adjustment for age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 21 patients 20 were included in final study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between atherosclerotic calcium measures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, ischemic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> had partial correlation with central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (R= 0.43 and 0.52, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, only intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> maintained a partial correlation with central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (R= 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this correlation did not reach a statistically significant level (P= .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> demonstrated a possible correlation with central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
