<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> have been reported, but few of the studies have been conducted in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,128 subjects (498 men aged, 68+/-14 years and 630 women aged 72+/-12 years) were divided into 4 groups according to serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (SUA) quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first investigated the association between SUA concentrations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>; then, we assessed whether there is an independent association of SUA with carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in a population subdivided according to gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In women, the prevalence of visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were significantly increased with increased SUA quartiles, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, smoking status, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, the odds ratios (95% CI) of sex-specific quartiles of SUA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were 1.0, 1.37 (0.79-2.37), 1.37 (0.79-2.38), and 1.80 (1.03-3.15) in men, and 1.0, 1.04 (0.56-1.94), 2.35 (1.30-4.22), and 2.20 (1.16-4.20) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for various known risk factors, the prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>&gt; or =1.0 mm) was higher in subjects in the second, third and fourth quartiles of SUA concentration with odds ratios (95% CI) of 2.41 (1.08-5.37), 3.33 (1.49-7.42), and 2.73 (1.17-6.35), respectively in men without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> but not in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> or in women with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was significantly increased according to SUA values only in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, SUA was found to be an independent risk factor for incidence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
