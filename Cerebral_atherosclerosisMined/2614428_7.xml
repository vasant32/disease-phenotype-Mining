<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The slices were subsequently embedded in paraffin-wax or celloidin and sections were cut in the same plane as the MRI slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the extent and severity of the abnormal MRI signal and the pathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas of diffuse MRI abnormality corresponded with areas of axonal and myelin loss with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, and small "lacune"-like lesions corresponded with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sparing of the subcortical U-fibres was seen histologically and on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal signal probably originates from increased tissue water attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and an expanded extracellular space </plain></SENT>
