<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the possibility of quantitatively diagnosing carotid and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> noninvasively, we measured common carotid flow volume in 60 sides (30 patients), using an ultrasonic quantitative flowmeter, and then compared these findings to the severity score of carotid and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as determined at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenosis decreased common carotid flow volume in the carotid and cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increases in the severity score varied inversely with reduced flow volume, which was high in inverse correlation (r = -0.696) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with flow volumes of 8.5 ml/sec or greater did not have stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with flow volumes of 6.4 ml/sec or less had stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, with 45% of these having stenosis greater than or equal to 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These pathological findings confirm that the common carotid flow volume reflects the degree of carotid and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> present and that the lower limit of common carotid flow volume in healthy subjects is 6.5 ml/sec </plain></SENT>
