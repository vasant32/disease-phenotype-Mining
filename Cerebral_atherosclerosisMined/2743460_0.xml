<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization was expressed by a utilization coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tolerance to i.v. <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> administration is reduced in the group of arteriosclerotic and hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the brain it declines even more, as compared with subjects in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the mean values of the coefficient of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization a significant difference was recorded between the group of patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the brain, as compared with the control group (p less than 0.001) and the group of arteriosclerotic and hypertonic patients, as compared with controls (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude from the results that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005293'>reduced glucose tolerance</z:mp> to orally administered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the brain and their potential candidates in no causal relationship with the variability of intestinal absorption, as similar changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance were recorded also after intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
