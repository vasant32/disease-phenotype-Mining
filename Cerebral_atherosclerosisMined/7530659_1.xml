<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these data and with a view to studying the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) on the cerebral circulation in humans, CBF was measured using the 133-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> inhalation method in 24 age matched human controls (group A1: age 58.5 +/- 6.2 years; group A2: 52.2 +/- 7.8 years) in nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> (B), in 11 CAD patients with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> (&gt; 300.h-1) (C) and in nine patients, after exclusion of CAD by angiography, also with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> (&gt; 300.h-1) (D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring was performed during the CBF measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF determined in the human control groups A1 and A2 was 79.9 +/- 9.9 ml.100 g.-1 min-1 and 81.5-13.0 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>100 g-1 min-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF was 74.1 +/- 13.6 ml  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>100 g.-1 min-1 (P = 0.267 vs A1) in group B, 65.8 +/- 11.8 ml.100 g-1 min-1 (P = 0.004 vs A1) in group C and 74.2 +/- 15.6 ml.100 g.-1 min-1 (P = 0.218 vs A2) in group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant reduction of CBF in CAD patients with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> have a significant impact on CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-CAD patients with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> did not show significant CBF decreases in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One can hypothetize that an impairment of electrical postextrasystolic potentiation, due to premature ventricular depolarization, and hence myocardial dysfunction leads to CBF reduction in CAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CBF reduction with CAD could also reflect concomitant coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
