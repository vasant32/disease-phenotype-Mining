<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard angiograms were compared with magnification angiograms in a group of 67 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnification angiography was more valuable than conventional angiography in 12 of 17 vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, while it was rarely valuable for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282607" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">vascular tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo>, occlusive diseases, collateral vessels, and capillary blush were also visualized to better advantage on magnification angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnification cerebral angiography is a useful tool for elucidating small vascular branches, but further refinement in the design of focal spots and angiographic techinques is required for further improvement of magnification cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
