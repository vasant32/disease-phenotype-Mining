<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since a cerebrovascular origin was attributed to such lesions, the present analysis set out to define the microvascular histopathologic changes in the periventricular WM in the aged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem samples of the frontal, parietal, and occipital periventricular WM of 40-90-year-old subjects were prepared for quantitative light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic examination revealed microvascular fibrohyalinosis as the most common type of microvascular damage in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis identified the microvascular thickening as collagen deposits affecting the basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular density did not correlate with the age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basement membrane pathology significantly increased, while the number of intact microvessels gradually decreased, with advancing age in the frontal and occipital WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> coincided with massive microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, particularly in the frontal WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate an age-related microvascular degeneration in the periventricular WM, which may contribute to the development of WM lesions by hindering a sufficient supply of nutrients to the affected WM sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data accord with previous observations identifying the frontal lobe as the site at which WM vulnerability is most pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in large, peripheral vessels is considered to be a predictive marker of microvascular pathology in the WM </plain></SENT>
