<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic characteristics of primary plaques and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> were studied in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data were related to symptoms, recurrence interval (6 to 176 months), arteriographic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, and in situ operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A striking predilection was noted for recurrent lesions to be located in the internal carotid artery near the origin, but still within the confines, of the original endarterectomy site and suture line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although recurrence was frequently associated with a long primary arteriotomy, evidence of technical faults or periarterial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early recurrent lesions (recurrence interval less than 36 months, n = 13) had significantly more smooth muscle cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> (p less than 0.001) than late recurrent lesions (recurrence interval greater than 36 months, n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (abundant collagen, calcium deposits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>) were more pronounced in late recurrences (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the histopathologic differentiation between early and late recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> was indistinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A continuum was noted whereby characteristics of late recurrent lesions increased in proportion to recurrence interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recurrent lesions were easily distinguished from primary plaques in that recurrences had a less orderly arrangement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elements and lacked the classic topographic features of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An important feature that differentiated primary and recurrent lesions was the presence of surface and intraplaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 90% of recurrent lesions (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was striking; this was frequently platelet-rich and showed organization devoid of neovascularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was more common in late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, consisted almost entirely of fibrin, and was often contiguous with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No discernible relationships were noted between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> associated with recurrent lesions and the presence or absence of symptoms, treatment with antiplatelet agents, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was a continuous and intrinsic component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> rather than a secondary, complicating feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> is a progressive lesion that stems from ongoing thrombogenesis occurring at the endarterectomy site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and smooth muscle cell proliferation comprise the bulk of the lesion, which undergoes atherosclerotic change with time </plain></SENT>
