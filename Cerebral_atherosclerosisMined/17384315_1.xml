<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were 80 adults over the age of 55 with an unequivocal diagnosis of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed measures of neuropsychological functioning, psychological symptoms, and two measures of subjective cognitive difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Psychological symptoms were most strongly associated with higher levels of reported cognitive difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall neuropsychological functioning was modestly related to subjective cognitive difficulties but did not remain significant after controlling for psychological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of older adults with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, self-reported cognitive difficulties were most strongly related to overall level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and not to actual cognitive test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, psychological factors may play an important role in the phenomenon of self-perceived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in geriatric populations </plain></SENT>
