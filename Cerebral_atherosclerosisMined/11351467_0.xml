<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the prevalence of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among patients admitted to a hospital with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to a Neurology ward in a University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were subjected to a CT scan, carotid duplex-Doppler ultrasonographic examination with Doppler measurement of blood flow velocity, permeability and plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac emboli were searched with transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred ten patients (39 women), aged 67.5 +/- 11.4 years old were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was atherothrombotic in 46 (41.8%), embolic in 30 (27.3%), lacunar in 27 (24.6%) and of other type in 7 (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety two patients (84.4%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, 38% had high cholesterol levels, 35% had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and 26% were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty five subjects (31.8%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid ultrasonography, 46 (41.8%) had mural plaques, 16 (14.5%) had multiple plaques without occlusion, 13 (11.8%) had a partial occlusion and 7 (6.4%) had a total occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis disclosed no significant relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age was the only significant predictor for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of severe carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was less than expected </plain></SENT>
