<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor 1alpha (MIF), a cytokine with immunoregulatory functions has been suggested to be involved in atherosclerotic plaque development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about MIF-inducing conditions in the atherosclerotic process and the association of MIF with plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two carotid endatherectomy samples from 36 patients and 4 aortic samples from young accident victims (as healthy controls) were analyzed for MIF staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MIF expressing tissues in the atherosclerotic plaques are mainly mononuclear cells (MNCs), but also endothelial cells of intimal microvessels (MVECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude and the intensity of their MIF expression was associated with the progression of plaques from early lesions (Stary I-III) to complicated plaque stages (Stary IV-VIII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In highly inflammatory and neovascularized regions of the plaques the colocalization of MIF expressing MNCs with CD40-L+ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>)-producing MNCs could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the notion that CD40-L fusion protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> are able to induce MIF production in the monocytic cell line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (&lt; or =1% O2) as a further proinflammatory and especially proangiogenetic factor was able to stimulate MIF secretion by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, human monocytes and HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and insulin remained without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MIF is expressed in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in close correlation with signs of instability, such as mononuclear cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neointimal microvessel formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the colocalization of MIF with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-producing MNCs and CD40-L+ cells in these plaques and the finding that proathero- and -angiogenic mediators such as CD40-L, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> are able to stimulate MIF expression in vitro suggest an important role of MIF in the modulation of atherosclerotic plaque stability </plain></SENT>
