<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We evaluated the feasibility of black-blood double inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (BBDIR) and CT imaging (CTI) for depiction of IAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed BBDIR on 20 control subjects and 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the thickness of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel wall in control subjects and the maximal and minimal thickness of IAPs in patients on BBDIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated signal intensity (SI) and the eccentricity of the IAP on BBDIR, and abnormal wall thickening and CT attenuation of IAPs on CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We correlated imaging features of BBDIR and CTI in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The difference of wall thickness between control and patient group was statistically significant (control subjects; basilar artery 0.6 mm, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 0.51 mm, and patients; maximal 2.34 mm, minimal 1.3 mm, P valueâ‰¤.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IAP showed eccentric remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> SI with the regions of high SI on BBDIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTI could not reveal abnormality in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suspicious intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and calcification was demonstrated in 3 patients by CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BBDIR could reveal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal wall of large intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CTI had limited role for detection of IAP, however, correlation of BBDIR and CTI could provide further characterization of the IAP's in terms of intraplaque calcification and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
