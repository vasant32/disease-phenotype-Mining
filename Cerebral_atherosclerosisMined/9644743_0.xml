<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study of the detection rate and potential pathogenetic significance of antibodies to low density oxidated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (LDOL) in patients who had ischemic cerebral circulation disorder (ICCD) at young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The examination (enzyme immunoassay, general and neurological investigations, laboratory and instrumental tests) covered 148 patients who survived ICCD at young age (mean age 37.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 48 of 108 (44%) patients had LDOL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were recorded in 33 (31%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LDOL antibodies were higher and occurred more frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> (35% of patients, mean LDOL antibodies-44 units) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (17% of patients, 45 units) than in atherosclerotic affection of the major head arteries (4%, 29 units) or occlusion of cerebral arteries of unclear genesis (8% of patients, 29 units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICCD were not related to fast development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or periaortitis due to production of LDOL antibodies as no relationships were found between their rise and <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of cerebral major arteries or periaortitis as shown by ultrasonic dopplerography or cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Feasibility of LDOL antibodies participation in the coagulation cascade and induction of hypercoagulatory condition causing ICCD needs special investigation </plain></SENT>
