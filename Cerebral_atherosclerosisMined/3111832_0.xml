<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted with three men and seven women, 72-84 years old, characterized by psychopathological and clinical signs of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered from disorder of sleep-waking rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With one exception every experiment ran for five days during which closed-eye-EEGs were registered at 8 a.m., 12 noon, 4 p.m., and 8 p.m. of the alert but relaxed patients and recorded on tape for computer processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously with every EEG registration the body temperature was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared statistically with corresponding data of a former study conducted with ten healthy aged volunteers (G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: The dominant peak-frequency of the patients turned out significantly slower than that of the volunteers.--While in healthy persons the peak frequency increased corresponding with the body temperature from the morning to the late afternoon or the early evening respectively, the patients lacked such a correlation, although their temperatures rose gradually in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients the peak-frequency had a remarkable small variety from day to day as well as from scalp-position, and its circadian shift was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Psychopathologically these subjects manifested primarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, general intellectual decline, and in four cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand the EEGs of three women showed substantial greater variety of the peak-frequency from day to day and from scalp-position to scalp-position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides the alterations during the day were rather excessive, but lacking any appreciable correspondence with the undisturbed circadian variations of the body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these three cases psychopathologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality changes</z:hpo> preponderated </plain></SENT>
