<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The medico-legal assessment of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> (recent or organized) usually requires some information regarding its cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quite often, especially in the absence of a known history of trauma, minor head injuries, which are no longer verifiable, are simply assumed to be the most likely causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering the fact that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> could also be non-traumatic, e.g. in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>haemorrhagic disorders</z:hpo>, cardiac conditions with persistent passive hyperaemia, true inflammatory and degenerative processes of the dura, etc., the medico-legal implication of a possible head injury would require the exclusion of such non-traumatic conditions capable of causing subdural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the case of a 92-year-old man, who suffered from cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> with occasional episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, is briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was reported to have fallen from his bed, was hospitalized and died 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A head injury was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, no skull fractures and no obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>bruises</z:mp> were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fresh bilateral temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These appeared consistent with a suspected head injury sustained as a result of a fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fairly large partly organized adherent subdural clots in the parieto-occipital region completely remote from and unconnected with the fresh bitemporal haematomas were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the gross pathology and the histology, an attempt is made to assess the possible cause of the organized clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of the findings indicated a possible non-traumatic origin, a consideration which is likely to affect the forensic implications </plain></SENT>
