<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) as a serum biomarker of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque in North Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque have high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies from western countries have shown an association between VEGF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, venous blood from 110 human subjects was collected, 57 blood samples of which were obtained from patients with carotid plaques, 38 neurological controls without carotid plaques, and another 15 healthy controls who had no history of serious illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum VEGF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also correlated the data clinically and carried out risk factor analysis based on the detailed questionnaire obtained from each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For risk factor analysis, a total of 70 symptomatic carotid plaque cases and equal number of age and sex matched healthy controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that serum VEGF levels in carotid plaque patients did not show any significant change when compared to either of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant upregulation of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the serum of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk factor analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and physical inactivity were the main correlates of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of patients was higher residing in urban areas as compared to rural region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found that patients coming from mountain region were relatively less vulnerable to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as compared to the ones residing at non mountain region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, alcohol consumption, and tobacco chewing were not observed as the determinants of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk in North India (p���&gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the pathogenesis of carotid plaques may progress independent of these inflammatory molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In parallel, risk factor analysis indicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and sedentary lifestyle as the most significant risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> identified in North India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This could be helpful in early identification of subjects at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and devising health care strategies </plain></SENT>
