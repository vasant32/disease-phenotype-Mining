<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (APAD), a highly prevalent condition in the general older population, is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events because of co-existing clinical or subclinical cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cognitive function is impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>-free patients with APAD, and whether inflammatory and haemostatic markers are associated independently with neuropsychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: cognitive performances of 164 well-functioning, community-dwelling patients with APAD were compared with those of 164 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control subjects on six neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and fibrinogen were also analysed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: patients with APAD scored significantly worse (P &lt; 0.0001) than control subjects on five cognitive tests assessing domains of verbal working memory, attention, perceptuomotor speed, mental flexibility, visuoconstructive skills and visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analyses showed that CRP and D-dimer were significant, independent predictors of poorer performances on four and three cognitive tests, respectively, within patients with APAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: patients with APAD show <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in a range of psychometric tests, and CRP and D-dimer appear to be independent negative predictors of some cognitive performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the need for screening for APAD among at-risk subjects in order to identify patients to be treated for prevention of functional decline and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also support the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> are implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> associated with APAD </plain></SENT>
