<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A5 gene (APOA5) -12238 T&gt;C and atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and forty-one subjects (170 ACI patients and 171 healthy controls) were collected to determine the genotypes by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APOA5 allele frequencies of T/C were 0.588/0.412 and 0.424/0.576 in ACI group and control group respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies between ACI group and control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in ACI patients with TT genotype were higher than those in patients with CC genotypes (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The relationship is found between the site of APOA5 gene -12238 T&gt;C and ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a significant correlation between TT genotype of APOA5 and the levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in patients with ACI </plain></SENT>
