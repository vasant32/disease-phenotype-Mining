<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Above 50% (maximum 70%) restenosis was observed in 7% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No critical postoperative restinosis was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 12% patients, restenosis was accompanied with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hematocrit, with fibrinogen (FG) being significantly increased in the absence of fibrinolytic activity (FL) elevation, indicating hemorheological disorders and homeostasis activation in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up showed that viscosity blood characteristics were elevated but functional activity of platelets and FA in patients did not differ from those in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, FG was high and fibrinolysis index was lower than mean statistical value that indicated predominance of blood procoagulation activity </plain></SENT>
