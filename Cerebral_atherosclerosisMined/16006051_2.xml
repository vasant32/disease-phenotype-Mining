<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>White patients rarely have intracranial large arterial steno-occlusive disease even if their systemic arteries are extensively involved, while non-white patients frequently have their intracranial arteries affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulate that during human population diversification, those who settled in Europe had acquired a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-suppressor genotype that increases their resistance against atherogenesis, but with protection confined to the intracranial large arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contemporary affluent lifestyle accelerates the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the whites, it involves the whole arterial bed except the intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People living in non-Western countries used to have a healthier way of living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They did not develop significant atherosclerotic diseases until recently when a westernised lifestyle was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike the whites, their intracranial arteries will not be spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has become a major cause of premature mortality in the modern world, and an anti-atherogenic mechanism would confer a selection advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With further adaptive intensification, this protection may extend to the rest of the arterial bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, future Homo sapiens will be able to tolerate an affluent lifestyle without much adverse sequel such as premature vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, if the mediator of this anti-atherogenic mechanism can be identified and applied therapeutically, we will have an ultimate mean to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
