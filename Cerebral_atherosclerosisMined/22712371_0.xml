<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical screening and value of vertebral artery ultrasound, Transcranial doppler (TCD), Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and Computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> combined with vertebral artery abnormalies according to vertebral artery digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2006 to September 2010, 186 patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, 133 cases were males and 53 cases were females,ranged from 30 to 84 years (with a mean of 63.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were estimated by DSA; 172 cases were estimated vertebral artery ultrasound and TCD; 53 cases were estimated by MRA; 25 cases were estimated by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive results by DSA were seen as case group, while the negative results were seen as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and concordance rate among four groups were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The abnormality rate of vertebral artery with DSA, vertebral artery ultrasound, TCD, MRA and CTA separately was 50.00% (93/186), 30.81% (53/172), 49.42% (85/172),15.10% (8/53) and 40.00% (10/25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to DSA standard, the sensitivity of vertebral artery ultrasound in diagnosing was 50.57%, the specificity was 89.41%, and concordance rate was 69.77%; while the sensitivity of TCD was 68.48%, the specificity was 72.50%, and concordance rate was 70.35%; the sensitivity of MRA was 21.43%, specificity was 92.00%, and concordance rate was 54.72%; the sensitivity of CTA was 63.64%,the specificity was 78.57%, and concordance rate was 72.00% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reasonable and combined application of vertebral artery ultrasound, TCD, MRA and CTA is helpful for diagnosing cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> combined with vertebral artery abnormalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the patients with cerebrovascular disease, cervical massage technique should be paid highly attention, which may cause vertebral artery injury and other complications </plain></SENT>
