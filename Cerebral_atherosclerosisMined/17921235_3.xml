<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The outcome for simultaneous revascularization of more than 1 supra-aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> has not been evaluated because of concerns regarding the increased risk of additional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the feasibility and safety of concomitant multiple supra-aortic arterial revascularizations (CMSAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 50 consecutive patients who underwent CMSARs with angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included a separate lesion group (LG) (n = 28), ipsilateral LG (n = 17) including adjacent (n = 6) and remote (n = 11) tandem lesions, and triple LG (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the procedural success (defined as residual stenosis &lt;30%) and periprocedural event rate (ER) (minor or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the ERs in the lesion (ipsilateral vs separate) and symptom (unstable vs stable) pattern groups with the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (50/50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural events within 30 days were noted in 5 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ER within 2 days after the procedure was higher in the ipsilateral LG (4/17) than in the separate LG (0/28) (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major events consisting of a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 2 patients in the unstable group (4%) and was more common in the unstable (2 of 7) than in the stable group (0/38) (P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the mean 11-month follow-up period, there was 1 symptomatic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CMSARs are feasible with a high procedural success rate resulting in a favorable short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, they must be carefully performed in ipsilateral LG, especially in patients in the unstable group </plain></SENT>
