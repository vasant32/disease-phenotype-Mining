<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data from large cohorts are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the prevalence of extracranial and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients aged 18-55 years in the multinational sifap1 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the sifap1 cohort (n = 5,023), we analyzed a subset of patients with complete data from carotid ultrasound studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and mobile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 2,187 patients (men: n = 1,319; 18-44 years: n = 744), intracranial arteries were additionally examined with ultrasonography in 1,612 patients (73.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by sex and age groups (younger: 18-44 years; middle-aged: 45-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and occlusions was 8.9% (younger: 4.9%; middle-aged: 11.0%), of which 81% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonstenotic carotid plaques were more common in men than in women (15.8% vs 7.7%; p &lt; 0.001), and in middle-aged than in younger patients (17.0% vs 4.9%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial intracranial artery stenoses and occlusions amounted to 11.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial stenoses occurred more frequently in middle-aged patients (13.0% vs 7.8%; p &lt; 0.001), whereas occlusions were equally common (both 3.2%; not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial proportion of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and occlusions in younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenoses and occlusions were even more prevalent than extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Together with nonstenotic plaques, one-fifth of patients (21.2%) had symptomatic or asymptomatic large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which should encourage future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention campaigns to target risk factor modification in young people </plain></SENT>
