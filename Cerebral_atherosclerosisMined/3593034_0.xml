<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is presently possible, ante mortem, by connecting the clinical picture with the CT scan findings, which are essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> are reported and the following picture was found: age 50 to 70 years old at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with scanty neurological signs; systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> course of the disease; and a CT scan, highly characteristic, that shows bilateral and symmetric subcortical hypodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one of the patients, that eventually died, an angiography disclosed a right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and a diminished flow in the thalamic striate arteries in both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other two patients are apparently stabilized with anti-hypertensive medication </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis should be considered much more frequently because it is possible to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> avoiding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> that is probably intimately linked with the genesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
