<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After calculating the fluid-blood-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-quotients, two distinct groups emerged, whose mean quotients showed significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first group (15 patients) with a mean quotient of 1.06, the diagnosis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was clinically confirmed in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second group (21 patients) with a mean quotient of 1.42, however, this occurred sixteen times, which represents a proportion of 2/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that a higher quotient suggests the diagnosis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
