<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), when comparing with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (S-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), have any distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, who had been admitted for a 2-year period, were divided into two groups: those who had R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and those who had S-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Registry data, medical records, and imaging findings were reviewed and compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 85 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>: 42 patients had R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, and 43 patients had S-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients had less cardiac embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> sources, less <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037823,C0869217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">speech disturbances</z:e>, shorter symptom duration, a longer time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment, less abnormalities on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and more significant relevant arterial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> were symptom duration &lt; 10 min (odds ratio OR 3.62; 95% confidence interval CI 1.37-9.57), &gt; or = 50% stenosis of the clinically relevant artery (OR 7.08; 95% CI 1.29-38.71), and absence of cardiac embolic sources (OR 0.04; 95% CI 0.002-0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> may have pathophysiological mechanisms distinct from those of S-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and so may provide a clue for the etiologic diagnosis, in that patients with R-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are more likely to have large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
