<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that, although the contrast detectability of IA DSA was superior to that of conventional angiography, its spatial resolution was not as great </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 70 cases, however, the spatial resolution of IA DSA was satisfactory for diagnosis, and it is concluded that the increased spatial resolution of conventional angiography should be necessary only in rare circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main disadvantage of IA DSA is the smaller field size, and it has several advantages over conventional film/screen angiography: (a) it is safer, since less contrast material is needed to visualize large vessels; (b) costs are lower since the magnetic recording tape and hard copies result in a savings of between $45 and $140 per examination; and (c) there is less need for darkroom personnel and film storage </plain></SENT>
