<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Investigating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the coronary artery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients is clinically important because comorbidity is relatively common in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the coronary artery to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the intracranial cerebral artery and extracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further investigation was performed for determining the factors independently associated with coronary artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We consecutively recruited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and they underwent vascular examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient-based vascular assessment was performed with magnetic resonance angiography of the cerebral arteries and computed tomography coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factors independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt; or =50%) were obtained from the conventional vascular risk factors and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> using the logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>Coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> was observed in 25.4% of the patients and this was associated with age (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.30) and the presence of stenosis of the extracranial carotid artery (OR: 11.37, 95% CI: 1.88-68.75) after logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> was not independently related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Careful concern about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> is needed when treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the extracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
