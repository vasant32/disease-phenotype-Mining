<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of recent papers suggesting that subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e>) is more common than historically assumed, this investigation was initiated to assess the frequency of SAE, to gauge the reliability of CT in making this diagnosis, and to assess the strength of the correlation between SAE and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 202 autopsied patients in a 17-month period, 82 had undergone antemortem CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 20 had CT findings thought to represent varying degrees of the disease spectrum of SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopy confirmed this diagnosis in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pattern of diminished attenuation in the white matter was periventricular in 16 patients (marked asymmetry in one) and limited to an isolated focus somewhat removed from the ependyma in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 16 with periventricular disease, the extent of the process by CT appeared mild in nine, moderate in five, and severe only in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two false positive CT diagnoses of SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among a control group of 10 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter by CT, seven had some microscopic evidence of SAE, although it was generally less severe than in those with positive CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> is common and can be identified in its various forms by CT with a high degree of reliability </plain></SENT>
