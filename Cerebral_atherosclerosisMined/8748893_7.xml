<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery plaques with intraplaque haemorrhage or atheromatous debris have been found to be associated with an increased risk of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other methods have failed to detect plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and it is not clear whether MRI allows differentiation between prognostically and therapeutically relevant plaque types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 17 carotid bifurcation plaques which had been removed in toto by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For quantifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal intensities (I) the contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) was used: (ITissue-IRef)/SDRef, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (0.9%) as reference (Ref) and the standard deviation (SD) of the noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were correlated with the histopathological appearance of "simple plaques", consisting of fibrous intimal thickening, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> deposits and/or atheromatous tissue with cholesterol crystals, largely calcified plaques, and "complicated plaques", containing recent intramural haemorrhage or friable atheromatous debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly different mean <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> could be measured in the three plaque types on T1- and T2-weighted sequences (p &lt; 0.00001) and using the FLASH pulse sequence with a flip angle of 15 degrees (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the T1-weighted sequence simple plaques showed a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> of 4.4 +/- 2.3, calcified plaques -4.8 +/- 2.6 and complicated plaques 15.1 +/- 4.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, each single plaque could be correctly classified, an unalterable prerequisite for a clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To date, motion artefacts due to patient movement or insufficiently triggerable vessel pulsation in combination with relative long acquisition times (6-7 min) have limited in vivo investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If these problems could be overcome, MRI might become a valuable technique for studying carotid plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
