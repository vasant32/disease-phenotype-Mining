<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endovascular revascularization for intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses is being increasingly performed at major medical centers and has been reported to be technically feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience with patients who underwent such a procedure for impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neurologic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 patients (21 intracranial lesions) treated between 1997 and 2002 at the authors' institution with endovascular revascularization were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had failed maximal medical therapy and was thought to be at high risk for an imminent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endovascular revascularization was performed on eight distal internal carotid artery lesions, six middle cerebral artery lesions, four intracranial vertebral artery lesions, and three basilar artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was complete in 5 arteries (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] Grade III), partial in 14 arteries (TIMI Grade II), and complete occlusion (TIMI 0) developed in 1 artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a patient with a tight basilar stenosis, no angioplasty could be performed because of the inability to cross the stenosis with the guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major periprocedural complications occurred in 9 (50%) patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 3 (17%), disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 2 (11%), and major extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 4 (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients died: one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and two from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877147" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiorespiratory failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular revascularization of intracranial vessels is technically feasible and may be performed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, periprocedural complication and fatality rates in neurologically unstable patients are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that patient selection, procedure timing, and periprocedural medical management are critical factors to reduce periprocedural morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
