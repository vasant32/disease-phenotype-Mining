<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was defined as a sudden episode of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, with complete resolution of the symptoms within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are considered an important prognostic symptom for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, being manifest in approximately 45% of the patients later undergoing a complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma total cholesterol levels did not differ in these patients, when compared with a similar series of patients of the same age and sex, free of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A slight elevation of mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels was detected in the patients of both sexes, as well as higher incidence of type IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0010980'>hyperlipoproteinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant finding, however, observed only in male <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, was that of significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reduction (-19.7% compared to the control group) is similar to that recently reported for patients with clear-cut ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL-cholesterol</z:hpo> levels in male <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients may be of considerable significance for a prognostic evaluation of this biochemical parameter </plain></SENT>
