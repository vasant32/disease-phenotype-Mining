<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores are measurement tools that stratify thromboembolic risk in patients with non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and are predictive of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores are more likely to have had an akinetic/hypokinetic left ventricular segment or a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the CHADS2 score components are also risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores may be predictive of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1733 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who underwent multi-slice computed tomography coronary angiography were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores with the presence and severity of CAD was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1733 patients, 1220 patients (70.4%) had any degree of CAD and 576 (33.3%) had significant CAD (≥50% stenosis in at least one coronary artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores increased, the presence of CAD also increased (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of CAD was correlated with CHADS2 score (Spearman coefficient 0.229, P &lt; 0.001) and CHA2 DS2 -VASc score (Spearman coefficient 0.261, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors, CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores ≥2 were independently associated with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was a better predictor of the presence of CAD than the CHADS2 score on area under the curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores were predictive of the presence and severity of CAD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When a patient has high CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores, physicians should consider coronary artery evaluation </plain></SENT>
