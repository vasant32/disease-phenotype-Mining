<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These intracranial lesions occurred in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 24 of 25 animals at various sites, mainly along arteries at the base of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No lesions were observed in penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were rich in smooth muscle cells and fibrous tissue, showing only rare fragmentation or disappearance of the internal elastic lamina, and only limited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few macrophages were observed in these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was seen between severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and age, systolic blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003692'>Xanthomas</z:mp> of the pia mater were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial findings were similar to those in human cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, indicating that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-prone homozygous WHHL rabbit represents the first animal model for spontaneous cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
