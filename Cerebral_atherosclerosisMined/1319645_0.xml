<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 95 subjects aged 60 to 74 years with varying intensity of circulatory atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (without brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The psychological tests were performed according to Wechsler's methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the EEG, visual and automatic spectral analyses were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data obtained were analyzed by means of discriminant, correlation and regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A certain relationship was found between the results of the psychological tests and the EEG readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method of automatic EEG analysis is proposed, which allows revealing intellectual disorders in patients suffering from cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its comparability with the data obtained by means of visual EEG analysis is discussed </plain></SENT>
