<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that in patients with stabilized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> there is a high percentage of positive Duplex Scanner examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of negative patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> leads us, in this case, to look for a carotid lesion placed higher up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high presence of bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> also shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not only a local process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical event may be caused by the type of carotid lesion (as demonstrated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or carotid lesions with superficial ulceration contralateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
