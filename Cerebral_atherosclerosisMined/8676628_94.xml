<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and prognosis cannot easily be predicted, even with intracoronary ultrasound and angioscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial angiographic and necropsy studies suggest that the risk of plaque rupture correlates only weakly with the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most ruptured plaques are characterised by a large pool of cholesterol or necrotic debris and a thin fibrous cap with a dense infiltration of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release of matrix-digesting enzymes by these cells is thought to contribute to plaque rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other thromboses are found on non-ruptured but inflamed plaque surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulated that both types of thrombotic events may be predicted by heat released by activated macrophages either on the plaque surface or under a thin cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test the hypothesis, we measured the intimal surface temperatures at 20 sites in each of 50 samples of carotid artery taken at endarterectomy from 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The living samples were probed with a thermistor (24-gauge needle-tip; accuracy 0.1 degree C; time contrast 0.15 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tissues were then fixed and stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Plaques showed several regions in which the surface temperatures varied reproducibly by 0.2-0.3 degrees C, but 37% of plaques had substantially warmer regions (0.4-2.2 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Points with substantially different temperatures could not be distinguished from one another by the naked eye; such points could also be very close to one another (&lt; 1 mm apart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Temperature correlated positively with cell density (r = 0.68, p = 0.0001) and inversely with the distance of the cell clusters from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface (r = -0.38, p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most cells were macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infrared thermographic images also revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in temperature among the plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Living atherosclerotic plaques show thermal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, which raises the possibility that an infrared catheter or other techniques that can localise heat or metabolic activity might be able to identify plaques at high risk of rupture or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
