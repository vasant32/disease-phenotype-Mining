<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The limitations of the medical management of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (SIAS) have encouraged the development of new strategies, such as endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors report and analyze a series of 63 endovascular procedures in which the Wingspan stent system was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 60 patients presenting with refractory SIAS, treated in 5 French neurointerventional centers between September 2006 and August 2009, were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiogram was systematically obtained 6 months after the procedure and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical neurological status was assessed and reported using the modified Rankin scale at 1-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 63 stenotic lesions was treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 65.3 years, and the mean diameter of the stenosis was 80.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 95.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of procedural complications was 20.6%, with a 4.8% rate of permanent postoperative morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-stent restenosis (ISR)/occlusion occurred in 11 cases (17.4%), of which 10 were asymptomatic and 9 were detected less than 1 year from the endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 case, the patient presented with a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and was treated again with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 13.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of SIAS demonstrates a moderate risk of neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, considering the critical natural history of severe refractory lesions, this may be considered the first alternative in cases of failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Technical failure, residual stenosis, or in-stent restenosis did not lead to systematic recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this series, which suggests the importance of plaque stabilization and neoendothelialization </plain></SENT>
