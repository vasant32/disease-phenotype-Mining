<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed brain MRI to evaluate silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SCI) and periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), and carotid-ultrasonography to investigate carotid atherosclerotic plaque in 170 high-risk community-dwelling subjects (mean age: 67.2 years; men: 28.7%) who met more than 3 of the following 9 criteria: 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (BP); 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>; 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>; 4) high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c; 5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>; 6) high waist-to-hip ratio; 7) smoking &gt; or =30 cigarettes/day; 8) heavy alcohol intake; 9) family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects with SCI (SCI group) were older (70 years vs. 66 years, p=0.004) and had higher systolic BP (SBP) (160 vs. 148 mmHg, p &lt;0.001) and higher carotid plaque score (2.3 vs. 1.5/person, p &lt;0.05) than those without SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the variables, smoking status (r =0.34, p &lt;0.001), SBP (r =0.28, p &lt;0.001), male gender (r =0.29, p &lt;0.001), left ventricular mass index (r =0.25, p =0.001), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (r =0.20, p =0.006) were significantly correlated with the number of SCIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among smokers, the number of SCIs was significantly higher in current smokers than in past smokers (1.9+/-2.2 vs. 0.5+/-0.8, p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, smoking status (beta =0.183, p =0.045) and SBP (beta =0.196, p =0.011) were independent determinants of the increased number of SCIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, smoking status was an independent determinant of multiple SCIs in a high-risk Japanese community-dwelling population </plain></SENT>
