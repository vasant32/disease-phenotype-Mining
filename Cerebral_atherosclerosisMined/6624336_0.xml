<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A combined study of the function of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was carried out in 250 young and middle-aged patients (40-59 years) presenting initial clinical manifestations of cerebral vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age of the subjects allowed the authors to conditionally refer them to a group of patients with early cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral bloodflow was studied by examining such parameters as 133Xe clearance, functional REG, EEG, orientation reaction and visual evoked potentials: the findings obtained made it possible to specify the role of hemodynamic disorders in the formation of neurologic defect at this stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data presented point to a considerable acceleration of the aging process in patients with ECA, i.e., the so-called <z:mp ids='MP_0003786'>premature aging</z:mp>, manifested in the fact that such patients appear to be 10-15 years older than their age as judged by many age parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend wider application of functional methods for the examination of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and hemodynamics aimed at determining the orientation and tactics of therapeutic and prophylactic measures with a view of preventing the progression and complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
