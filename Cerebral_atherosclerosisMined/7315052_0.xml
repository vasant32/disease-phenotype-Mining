<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach consists in exposing the pathological focus in the brain to the action of decimeter electromagnetic waves (DW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of treating 112 patients with cerebral circulation disorders have demonstrated a sufficiently high effectiveness and a broad range of the therapeutic action of this new method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decimeter waves contributed to restoration of the motor and sensor functions in the patients with the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; they produced a regulatory effect on the cerebral ad peripheral blood circulation, the brain bioelectric activity, the functions of the neuromuscular apparatus, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, the blood coagulation and anticoagulation system and the neuromediator metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data obtained suggest that it is a diminution (achieved with the use of DW) of the pathological impulsation flow from the pathological focus in the brain that plays the main role in the restoration of the impaired functions in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is very important for understanding the pathogenesis of cerebral circulation disturbances </plain></SENT>
