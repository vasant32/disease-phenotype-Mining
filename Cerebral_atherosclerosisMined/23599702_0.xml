<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited treatments for severe intracranial stenosis, and stent placement versus medical treatment remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare functional outcomes of these two modalities in patients with severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At a single center, between 2008 and 2011, patients with angiographically demonstrated severe (70-90%) symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were divided into two groups: group A, which received only medical treatment, and group B, which underwent endovascular stent implant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity and location of the stenosis was determined by digital subtraction angiography and the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial criteria in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exclusion criteria were: specific causes other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>, fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, radiation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, focal neurological deficit that did not correlate to internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were done under light anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Technical success was defined as the reduction of stenosis to &lt;30% with complete enveloping of the lesion after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early and late adverse events and functional outcomes were compared between the groups using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 63 patients (29 in group A and 34 in group B) were evaluated and followed for a mean period of 15.22 months (range 6-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 97% in a total of 34 stents in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the early (within 30 days) adverse event rates of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration for the stent implant patients was 15 months (range 6-25), and for the medically treated cohort it was 14 months (range 8-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The re-stenosis rate was 5.8% and the total number of late (&gt;30 days) adverse events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, was 1 (2.9%) and 6 (20.7%) in the stent implant and medical groups, respectively (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The stent implant group had significantly better favorable functional outcomes according to the mRS than the medical group (93.9 vs. 63.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cumulative secondary adverse event-free survival was significantly lower in the stent implant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent implants can be considered more durable and safe for patients with symptomatic severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery, despite optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Randomized, multicenter trials are required to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
