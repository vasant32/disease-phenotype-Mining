<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>17.5% of these patients died within 4 weeks, 43% of this group from extracerebral complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The survival-time of those patients, surviving the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, was also shortened: one year later only 67% of the patients were still alive, 5 years later 58% and after 10 years only 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many cases died from further cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is only one of the symptoms of a generalized artery disease, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resulting poor collateral circulation may be the crucial factor leading to the poor prognosis as to survival and rehabilitation: only 3.8% of the patients returned to work, 19% are able to walk, and 55% need nursing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These facts demand prophylactic measures: first a decisive therapy with respect to the risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, second an alertness to transitory ischemic attacks or small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter were found in 56% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The literature and value of different therapeutic measures will be discussed </plain></SENT>
