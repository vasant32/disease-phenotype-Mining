<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with intracranial arteriosclerotic disease have significant morbidity and mortality rates, and some are unresponsive to medical treatment and have unacceptable surgical risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the intracranial vessels is a possible alternative to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To present our experience with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and to summarize our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent intracranial percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for high-grade arteriosclerotic stenosis based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had symptoms referable to the stenosis except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed in 6 intracranial vertebral arteries, 3 basilar arteries, 5 middle cerebral arteries, and 3 distal internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had concomitant stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 1 treatment failure secondary to tortuous vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessel caliber was increased to more than 80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 patients and to 50% to 70% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 patients, with a reduction of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1708549" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intimal dissections</z:e> occurred during angioplasty; one of these, in a precavernous segment of the internal carotid artery, was stented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient restenosed within 1 month of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining treated arteries remained patent during follow-up of 3 months to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> as a complication occurred in 2 patients, 1 mild and 1 severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Occlusive arteriosclerotic disease involving the intracranial cerebral vessels can be managed medically with antiplatelet and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drug therapy or surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, in patients who are unresponsive to medical therapy or who have unacceptable surgical risks, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is an attractive alternative that can be performed in selected patients with relatively low risk and good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
