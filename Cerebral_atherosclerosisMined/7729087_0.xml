<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease, indicated as advanced high intensity areas on T2-weighted MRI, increased with advancing age, while large vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> detected with MRA did not increase after the age of 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was not always accompanied with advanced high intensity areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was found in 12 (44.4%) of 27 patients with BVD, and was as common as that of the controls of the eighth decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was frequently seen in the cases suffering from BVD below 70 years of age or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with BVD develop cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> more preferentially in the small vessels rather than the large vessels especially in aged cases, of which incidence is similar to that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls over 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
