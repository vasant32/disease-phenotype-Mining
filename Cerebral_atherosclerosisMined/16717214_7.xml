<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is scant information on secular trends in the incidence and survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors established three cohorts of Hisayama residents age &gt; or =40 years in 1961 (1,618 subjects), 1974 (2,038 subjects), and 1988 (2,637 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They followed up with each cohort for 12 years, comparing the incidence and survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic examinations by autopsy or brain imaging was performed on most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> cases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> significantly declined by 59% for men and by 28% for women from the first to the second cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It continued to decline by 41% for men, but the decline decelerated for women between the second and third cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized incidence of atherothrombotic infarction tended to decline from the first to the second cohort, whereas it was sustained between the second and third cohort for both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized incidence of cardioembolic infarction was unchanged throughout the cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cohorts, mean blood pressure levels among hypertensive subjects and the prevalence of current smoker decreased with time, though the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> significantly improved among the cohorts, but those of atherothrombotic and cardioembolic infarction did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in the Japanese population, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> steadily declined for the last 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> control and decreasing prevalence of smoking might be responsible for this trend </plain></SENT>
