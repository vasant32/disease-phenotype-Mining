<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess cerebral hemodynamic compromises of significant carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of occlusion using vasodilatory testing (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test) in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 36 patients with unilateral, hemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were investigated using transcranial Doppler <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 12 asymptomatic and 24 symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity was measured at rest and after intravenous injection of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute mean blood flow velocities and the cerebrovascular reactivity was compared at the stenotic and non-stenotic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a further analysis the mean velocities and the cerebrovascular reactivity values of the stenotic side were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test performed on 28 healthy volunteers were used as control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no side-differences between the middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular reactivity values in the asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic group, however middle cerebral artery mean velocity and cerebrovascular reactivity after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was significantly lower on the stenotic side, than on the non-stenotic one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparing the different groups non-stenotic sides did not differ to each other in their cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic patients, however, cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular reserve capacity after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was lower, than that of the stenotic side of asymptomatic patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The transcranial Doppler is a suitable method for detecting altered cerebral hemodynamics in significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity may refer to the impairment of cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
