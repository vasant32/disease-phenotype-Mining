<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> of the entire circumference of a segment of cerebral artery, usually considered due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are relatively thick-walled and elongated, causing neural compression or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have noted a subset of fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> that vary from this common description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Out of a series of 472 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated over 11 years, 11 patients between the ages 16 and 67 years (mean age 37) were identified who had discrete fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> unassociated with generalized cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, six with neural compression by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and two were discovered incidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located in the posterior circulation, the other two in the intracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean length and width were 16.3 and 11 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were exposed surgically were partly or substantially thin-walled with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing parent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight were treated with proximal occlusion and three were circumferentially "wrapped" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one mild disability and the remaining patients made good recoveries (follow-up 0.5 - 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> with discrete fusiform <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, apparently unrelated to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e>, thin-walled in part or whole, more common in the vertebrobasilar system, and possessing a risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatments currently available include proximal occlusion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wrapping", different approaches than neck-clipping or endovascular coiling of side-wall saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> that leave the parent artery intact </plain></SENT>
