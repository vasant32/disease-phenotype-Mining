<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To make a retrospective analysis of the synthesis of antibodies to the MOMPS and LPS antigens of Chlamydia pneumoniae in patients with occlusive disease of the peripheral arteries (ODPA) and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 190 samples of plasma from patients included in the following groups: group 1:66 samples from 66 patients with ODPA; group 2:74 samples from 31 patients with MS (20 remittent-relapsing and 11 secondarily progressive), followed over time; and group 3:50 samples from persons acting as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases determinations were made using ELISA, of the IgG anti-MOMP and the IgG and IgA anti-LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the continuous variables was made using the Mann-Whitney U Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discrete variables were analysed using the exact bilateral Fisher Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon Test over ranges was used to compare the evolution of antibodies in the patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of positive results in groups 1 to 3 for anti-LPS IgG were: 24.6%, 18.9% and 20.8%, respectively, with no differences between patients and controls; nor were there any differences with IgA (29%, 29.7% and 25%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However differences were seen in the anti-MOMP IgG between patients and controls (group 1:80.3%, group 2:37.8% and group 3: 33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with MS the results of the evolution of the antibodies did not reflect a uniform tendency of the levels of the different antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A higher level of IgG anti-MOMP was seen in ODPA and MS, although this did not occur with anti-LPS or IgA </plain></SENT>
