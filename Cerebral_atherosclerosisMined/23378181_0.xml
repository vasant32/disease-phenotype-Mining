<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After identification of the entity, imaging must be performed to identify the etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing external compression of the vertebral artery from intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or dissection is critical to aid the clinician in the therapeutic decision tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with an external compression due to an osteophyte may benefit from definitive surgical decompression and excision of the bony structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with extracranial disease of the vertebral artery who have failed maximal medical therapy may benefit from angioplasty and stenting which appears to carry a low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissections</z:e> can be treated with medical therapy using anti-platelet agents or on occasion anti-coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rarely, endovascular options are required if a patient is having hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> due to flow failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In such circumstances, stenting and angioplasty may be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is best managed with maximal medical therapy due to the high rate of complications attributable to stenting and angioplasty </plain></SENT>
