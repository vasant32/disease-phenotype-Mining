<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The impact of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> and Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) data is described in combination with the commercial release of the Wingspan stenting system on the frequency of neurointervention for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) in a tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endovascular case logs were reviewed from April 2004 to July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total number of intracranial neurointerventions and the number of neurointerventions (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) or with stenting (PTAS)) performed for symptomatic ICAD were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time period evaluated was divided into two equal 19.5-month epochs representing the time periods before and after the availability of the Wingspan system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of neurointerventions for ICAD increased by 763%, from seven of 354 total cases (2%) to 56 of 367 total cases (15.3%) (p&lt;0.001) after the Wingspan system became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in intracranial PTAS volume occurred immediately and was stable throughout the "Wingspan era" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The publication of the WASID trial results combined with the availability of the Wingspan stent system led to a marked increase in the frequency of neurointervention for symptomatic ICAD at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adoption of this technology occurred without direct evidence that PTAS with Wingspan is superior to traditional medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the need for a randomized trial of stenting and medical therapy for the treatment of this disease process </plain></SENT>
