<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) have similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> frequencies compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with other etiologies, but a strong capacity for arteriogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved in the upregulation of the arteriogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in MMD still remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated if circulating endothelial progenitor cells are increasingly mobilized during MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty MMD patients, 8 patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, and 15 healthy individuals were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and circulating endothelial progenitor cells were characterized by triple staining using antibodies against CD133, CD34, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In MMD patients the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells was significantly higher than in atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease patients (P&lt;0.002) and healthy controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations in MMD patients and in atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease patients were significantly higher compared to those in healthy controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation between circulating endothelial progenitor cell numbers and serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (r=-0.53; P&lt;0,02) was found in the MMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show increased circulating endothelial progenitor cell numbers in MMD, which may play a role in the increased arteriogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results suggest that increased circulating endothelial progenitor cell mobilization in MMD may not be entirely mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
