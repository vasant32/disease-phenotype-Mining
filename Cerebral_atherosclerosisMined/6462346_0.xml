<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are reporting such a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> with anomalous origin of the ophthalmic artery and atheromatous stenosis of the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 49-year-old-man was referred to our neurosurgical clinic because of transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed as carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and was treated within aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet adhesiveness and aggregation were slightly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right common carotid angiogram showed marked stenosis of the origin of the external carotid artery and small "sail-like" plaque in the internal carotid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The angiogram also demonstrated that the right ophthalmic artery was originated from the middle meningeal artery through the superior orbital fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since choroid crescent was observed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the branches of the ophthalmic artery including the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery were filled by the external carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The right ophthalmic artery was never visualized by the selective internal carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
