<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time comparisons of EEGs and data of their compressed spectral analysis were made in healthy subjects and patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of various character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on long-time on-line registration of the EEG spectrograms in patients with the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are presented, and the time course of the changes of those spectrograms in patients with the ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognostic criteria of the EEG spectrograms in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of various gravity are determined </plain></SENT>
