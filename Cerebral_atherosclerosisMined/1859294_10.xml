<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duration of cigarette smoking was the most significant independent predictor of the presence of ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other independently significant predictors of ICAS were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and current systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and duration of smoking was a significant negative predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients for whom serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> values were available, lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I were associated with a higher risk of having ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I as a predictor of the presence of ICAS was far outweighted by the effects of duration of smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
