<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is especially prevalent in Asians, but intracranial stent placement and medical treatment for severe intracranial stenosis are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared long-term outcomes of these 2 therapeutic approaches in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with angiographically proved severe (â‰¥70%) symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, with or without stent placement, were retrospectively reviewed at a single center between 2002 and 2009, with adjustments for age, sex, vascular risk factors, degree of baseline stenosis, and baseline functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 114 patients followed from 3 to 36 months (mean, 17.3 months) after initial diagnosis, 53 received 56 stents in addition to medical treatment (stent-placement group), and 61 matched patients received only medical treatment (medical group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total clinical events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were 12 (22.6%) and 15 (24.6%) in the stent-placement and medical groups, respectively (P = .99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stent-placement group had significantly better functional outcomes than the medical group (94.3% versus 78.7% for mRS scores of 0-3, P = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most events in the stent-placement group occurred within the first week of the periprocedural period (17.0%) as minor embolic or perforator infarctions, and the rate of events decreased thereafter (5.7%, P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stent placement over the perforator-rich <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and BA independently predicted periprocedural events on multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the medical group, events increased in frequency (21.7%) and severity with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the total ischemic event rate was similar in the 2 groups during a 3-year follow-up, the stent-placement group had a more favorable functional outcome despite minor periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
