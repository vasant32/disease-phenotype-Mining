<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to confirm the presence of HCMV IE gene DNA in intracranial artery walls and the association of the virus with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HCMV IE gene was tested in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>-fixed intracranial arteries from 35 cases with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and 20 negative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of DNA in sections of paraffin-embedded tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probes and primers were derived from major immediate early (MIE) genomic regions of cytomegalovirus strain AD169 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DNA of HCMV was found in 40.0% and 10.0% of arterial walls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and negative control group by in situ hybridization, respectively, in 60.0% and 30.0% by PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant deference was found between them (P=0.018, P=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also significant difference between grade III-IV and grade I-II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by both methods (P=0.027, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggested that HCMV IE DNA exists in the atherosclerotic arterial walls, therefore, there might be an association between the IE gene in intracranial artery walls and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The arterial wall with the smooth muscle cells, might be the potential site of the virus persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HCMV may play a role in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
