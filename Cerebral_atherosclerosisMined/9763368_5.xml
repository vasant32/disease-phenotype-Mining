<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ischemic cerebral events in the anterior (n = 18) and posterior (n = 9) circulation underwent contrast-enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in the coronal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were examined in a blinded fashion by two observers independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was classified according to the appearance of the residual lumen (no stenosis, mild stenosis, moderate stenosis, severe stenosis, occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography was used as the standard of reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal great vessels and carotid siphons were not assessable on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms in 35% of cases owing to limited coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cervical and petrous segments of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and 93% of the extracranial vertebral arteries were assessable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow-related artifacts were observed in seven cases of severe stenosis, including three with signal void at the site of narrowing and four with signal loss in the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was good and significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall agreement between 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and conventional angiography was good for the anterior and posterior circulations despite a tendency toward overestimation of stenoses on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant stenoses and occlusions were correctly identified on 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms, providing good sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is a promising tool for assessing arteriosclerotic lesions of supraaortic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger groups are required to determine its value for patient care </plain></SENT>
