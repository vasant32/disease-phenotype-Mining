<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: whether stenting is superior to angioplasty in the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dissections, vessel rupture, and lesion recoil observed with primary angioplasty using balloon catheters designed for coronary arteries have undermined the role of primary angioplasty as a preferred treatment for intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to report the immediate and 3-month outcomes of treating patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease with angioplasty balloon catheters in a multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: this is a retrospective review of 74 patients from 4 institutions treated with primary angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic disease over a 6-year time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Technical success (residual stenosis ≤ 50%), periprocedural success (no vascular complication within 72 hours), and 3-month outcomes are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the mean degree of stenosis pretreatment was 79% ± 14% and reduced to 34% ± 18% after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 68 (92%; 95% CI, 83% to 97%) of the 74 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural success was achieved in 65 (88%; 95% CI, 78% to 94%) of the 74 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 4 (5%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 13%) major procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 of which resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 6 hours of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 5% (4 of 74; CI, 1.5% to 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three-month follow-up was available in 71 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this interval, 2 patients had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 in the ipsilateral territory and the other in the contralateral territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 3-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 8.5% (6 of 71; CI, 3.1% to 17.5%); the retreatment rate was 2.8% (2 of 71; CI, 0.3% to 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: balloon angioplasty is a relatively safe alternative treatment for intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its role in the long-term secondary prevention of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with intracranial stenting and medical therapy remains to be determined, preferably in a randomized study </plain></SENT>
