<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The remodeling of arterial extra-cellular matrix induced by hemodynamic stimuli is involved in the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the carotid and cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scarce information is available on the relationship between atherosclerotic changes in brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> itself and its intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surgical exploration of a large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> depicted extensive atherosclerotic changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computational tomographic angiography of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was used to create an in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model was used to perform intra-aneurysmal flow measurement using particle imaging velocimetry and LDV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic pattern with wall shear stress distribution was compared between areas with and without atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No high oscillation of wall shear stress was observed on the atherosclerotic plaque area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of wall shear stress tended to be higher in the area without atherosclerotic changes than the area with those changes (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no atherosclerotic change at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> inflow zone, where relatively fast flow velocity and higher magnitude of wall shear stress was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This single case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> shows some similarity in hemodynamic values observed in cases of carotid atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
