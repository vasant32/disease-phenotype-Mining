<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusive disease is associated with most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, and carotid artery intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is particularly important in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors' experience with intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients undergoing bilateral carotid endarterectomy was reviewed to determine whether unilateral intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is predictive of the condition occurring on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients underwent staged bilateral carotid endarterectomy performed by one vascular surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each plaque was reviewed by a pathologist for the presence of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 33 demonstrated intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on the side of initial endarterectomy; 27 of these 33 (82%) had bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the initially operated carotid atheroma is highly predictive of the condition occurring in the contralateral atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aggressive follow-up in this patient population may be warranted </plain></SENT>
