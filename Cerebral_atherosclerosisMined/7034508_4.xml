<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 65% of the patients, the digital subtraction angiogram was diagnostic, but the overall quality was inferior to conventional selective angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 22%, the digital subtraction angiogram provided diagnostic information, but there was a significant chance of misinterpreting the results of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 13% of cases, the subtraction angiogram was not diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As now developed, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional cerebral angiography for preoperative evaluation of the juxtasellar carotid artery prior to transphenoidal surgery because the large intracerebral vessels are consistently well visualized with digital subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dural sinuses are better visualized with digital subtraction than with conventional angiography because with digital subtraction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the vessels of the brain are opacified, whereas with conventional angiography, there is a mixture of opacified and unopacified blood in the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined with computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional angiography for determining the preoperative extent and vascularity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be used for postoperative evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, extracranial to intracranial bypasses, and after the embolization of vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
