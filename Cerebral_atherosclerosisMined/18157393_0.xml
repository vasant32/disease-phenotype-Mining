<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The apo B/apo A-I ratio represents the balance between atherogenic particles, rich in apo B, and the antiatherogenic ones, apo A-I rich </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between atherosclerotic diseases in different anatomical sites and apo B/apo A-I ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A-I and B were assessed in 30 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS), 30 with peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial obstructive disease</z:e> (PAOD), and 38 healthy subjects (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HDLc and Apo A-I were significantly lower in PAOD and CAD groups, respectively, than in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were observed for CAD and PAOD groups than for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apo B was significantly higher in IS group than in control and PAOD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apo B/apo A-I ratio showed significantly higher in CAD and IS groups when compared to control and PAOD groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The apo B/apo A-I ratio was important for identifying an increased trend for coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In spite of the increased trend for apo B/apo A-I ratio in IS and CAD groups, the studied variables cannot be considered in an isolated way, given as those parameters were analyzed together by a binary logistic regression, no association has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
