<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bearing this in mind, the authors examined 78 patients who suffered ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group was made up of 50 patients who suffered ischemic brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a stable neurological defect (SSD), the second one comprised 28 patients who suffered brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a reversible neurological defect (SRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been established as a result that the initial level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sympatheticotonia</z:e> and the intensity of the signs of vegetodystonia was higher in patients with SSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that in SRD, the level of ascending nonspecific brain activation prevailed according to the responsiveness of the reference alpha-rhythm as compared with the first group patients and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data obtained are discussed from the standpoint of the compensatory role played by the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in the pathogenesis and course of the clinical forms of ADCC differing in the gravity and prognosis </plain></SENT>
