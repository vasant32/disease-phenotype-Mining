<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data obtained before, during and after 335 operations in these patients revealed the following pathogenetic factors in the infarction: (1) The patient with the highest coronary risk had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of at least 160/95 mmHg and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> combined with coronary arterial, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular, and renovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>Myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> occurred when oxygen supply was reduced, as evidenced from a fall in systolic blood pressure to 70 mmHg or less during operation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RBC smaller than or equal to 3,5 times 10-6/mul) early after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(3) Risk of infarction was highest during the early postoperative stress period with elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels and thus an increased myocardial oxygen demand </plain></SENT>
