<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the nerve fibers are primarily located at the adventitial-medial border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Placing a silastic collar around a carotid artery for 14 days, in rabbits fed a diet high in cholesterol, resulted in a focal, intimal thickening in 10 out of 12 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contralateral sham-operated arteries showed no intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At sites where intimal thickening occurred, there was a disappearance of the perivascular nerve network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carotid arteries from rabbits that did not respond to the collar and the sham-operated carotid arteries showed an intact and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perivascular nerve network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group of animals which responded to the collar with intimal thickening, there was evidence of a proliferative response proximal to the collar and in this same tissue there was evidence of degeneration of nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it has been demonstrated for the first time that, in regions of the carotid artery where intimal thickening occurred, there was an associated degeneration of the perivascular nerve network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of this degeneration and its functional consequences require further investigation </plain></SENT>
