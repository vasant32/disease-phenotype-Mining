<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in swine of these 3 age-groups form a continuous series and are morphologically identical with corresponding stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of man.It is concluded that swine can replace non-human primates as subjects for studies of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and that experimental designs must allow for age and behaviour patterns of the species </plain></SENT>
