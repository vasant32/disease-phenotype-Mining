<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether mortality from and the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have changed since the last study in Accra in 1981, the sites of the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular disease and to describe the age and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases over a five-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in persons aged 20 years and above, confirmed at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> constituted eleven per cent of autopsies carried out at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, in the five-year period 1994 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar study in 1981 showed the same proportion indicating that the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall male to female ratio was 1.2:1 but the relative risk (RR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher for females at 1.23 (95% CI=1.10-1.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was still more common than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> the proportion (61 %) was much less than that of the previous study (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Males were more likely (RR 2.07 95% CI=1.75-2.45) to die from haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than females (RR 1.32, 95% CI=1.10-1.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty nine per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients died in less than 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The peak age of fatal haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 50-59 years and that of infarction was 60-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Male mortality exceeded female mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups up to 60-69 years after which female mortality became preponderant (chi2 with Yates correction = 4.28,0.05&gt;p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the dominant factor in haemorrhage and an important factor in infarction while cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was the major factor in infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhage into intraparenchymal sites, mainly the cerebral hemispheres, was more common than into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in autopsy cases has not changed since the last study in 1981 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> still remains an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Accra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cerebral haemorrhage is still a more common cause of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than infarction, although the pattern appears to be changing gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Females have a slightly greater risk of dying from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A community-based study is needed to provide more insight into some aspects of the problem and to provide the basis for appropriate interventions and policy, especially with regard to a control of risk factors </plain></SENT>
