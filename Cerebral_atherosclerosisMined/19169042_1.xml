<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of extracranial (EC) and intracranial (IC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> varies among races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have sought to identify specific vascular risk factors that are associated with EC or IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the exact relationships are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine if there are any specific risk factors for EC or IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this study, we considered 3,349 consecutive patients who had been entered into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry between January 1999 and June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the exclusion of patients who had not undergone angiography, patients with cardiac sources of embolism or other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and non-Koreans, we had a total of 2,169 patients of single ethnicity with an angiographic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in both the IC and EC arteries (856 patients) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identified 1,313 patients who had EC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (EC group, n = 256), IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (IC group, n = 566) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiographic findings (no-lesion group, n = 488) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of risk factors and the demographic parameters were compared among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the IC group was associated with older age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and the EC group was associated with older age, higher initial blood sugar and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in a direct comparison between the IC and EC groups, we did not observe any significant risk factors or variables except for a higher frequency of males and higher total cholesterol levels in the EC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular risk factors may not be major determinants of location for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the EC or IC arteries </plain></SENT>
