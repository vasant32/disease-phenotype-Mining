<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an immunoperoxidase technique together with electron microscopy, apoB was localized only in arteries with atherosclerotic involvement and to the following regions in these arteries: 1. on the outer aspects of extracellular spherical structures with diameters of 250 to 700 A found predominantly in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> cores and between bands of collagen fibers of advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>; 2. on the surface of reduplicated elastica; 3. along collagen fibers and; 4. on aggregates of extracellular spherical <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> globules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the extracellular spheres may represent the fine-structural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of deposited low and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> and that free apoB may be bound to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> globules, elastica, and collagen fibers </plain></SENT>
