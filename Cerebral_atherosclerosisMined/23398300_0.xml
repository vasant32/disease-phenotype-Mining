<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between past <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in non-cardiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had a past history of large-artery disease (LAD) or small-artery disease (SAD) subtypes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LAD was subdivided into intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ECAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were categorized as artery-to-artery embolism, in situ thrombotic occlusion and local branch occlusion, while SAD was subdivided into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) and branch atheromatous disease (BAD) on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between past and current <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 202 patients enrolled, the LAD group (n = 111) had 64 and 47 patients with ICAS and ECAS, and the SAD group (n = 91) had 63 and 28 patients with LI and BAD, respectively, at the time of past <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with LAD developed LAD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> most often (n = 99, 89.2%), and patients with SAD developed SAD most often (n = 69, 75.8%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICAS were more likely to develop ICAS later (n = 46, 79.3%), whereas those with ECAS developed ECAS more often (n = 31, 75.6%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICAS presenting with artery-to-artery embolism more often developed artery-to-artery embolism later (n = 26, 72.2%), whereas those with local branch occlusion developed recurrent local branch occlusion most often (n = 10, 66.7%, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the SAD group, patients with BAD developed LAD more frequently than the LI group (n = 11, 39.3% vs. n = 9, 14.3%, P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The subtypes and mechanisms of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are significantly influenced by those of the past <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
