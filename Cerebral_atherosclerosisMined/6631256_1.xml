<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method is a simple one but requires an experienced operator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Care should be taken to visualize mainly the zones of predilection of the atheroma (carotid bifurcation and ostia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even minimal sized atheromatous plaques can be detected, including those that are frequently asymptomatic to the doppler test, and their calcareous, regular, or ulcerated nature can be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The limits of the examination are described, demonstrating the need for complementary ultrasound and doppler tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two main poles of interest of this vascular imaging are early detection of carotid atheroma and supervision of medical and surgical treatments </plain></SENT>
