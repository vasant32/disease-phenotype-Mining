<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental researches of the last years proved that the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be the common mechanisms that intervenes in the occurrence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications as well as in the aging process and is responsible for the increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications at elderly diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Starting from this information, we performed a comparative study where we followed the intensity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> at elderly diabetics as compared to adult diabetics and non-diabetic elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, we have followed the involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic microangiopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>155 patients from the 4th Medical Clinic were studied during 2000-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into three lots: lot 1: elderly diabetics, lot 2: adult diabetics, lot 3: elderly non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At these patients we have followed comparatively the intensity of the oxidant status by determining the plasma malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and the anti-oxidant status by determining the plasma ceruloplasmin, as well as the correlations of these two parameters with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At elderly diabetics there is an increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> underlined by an increased plasma level of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and ceruloplasmin as compared to the adult diabetics and non-diabetic elderly people and this increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is involved in the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications at this patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case of elderly diabetics, the age and the illness may induce the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals with synergic effect in injuring tissues and organs </plain></SENT>
