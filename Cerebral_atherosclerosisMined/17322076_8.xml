<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical and imaging studies have reported an independent and intriguing association between intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE) and markers of small-vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) such as lacune(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a large brain-autopsy collection to investigate the relation between IADE and pathologically assessed cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The entire arterial tree from the heart to the intracranial small intracerebral arteries was investigated in 381 consecutive autopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors, heart status (weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), prevalence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> from heart to brain (aortic arch, carotid, vertebral, and intracranial arteries), dolichoectasia, cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and brain tissue lesions (lacune(s), état criblé) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and heart weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three (6%) of 381 patients had IADE, affecting mainly the basilar artery, with a median basilar artery diameter of 6 mm (range, 4 to 9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with IADE had a &gt;2-fold increase in the prevalence of basilar artery plaques and ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch (both P=0.006), but there were no associations with coronary or cervical artery plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> was more frequent in IADE-positive than in IADE-negative patients (45% vs 18%; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio was 3.85 (95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 9.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> was not observed in IADE-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without IADE, those with IADE were more likely to have pathologic evidence of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and its consequences, independent of age, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IADE and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> may have unidentified biologic processes in common </plain></SENT>
