<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmortem in vitro proton MRI was performed on the brains of seven consecutive elderly patients dying of nonneurologic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scans were done in the fresh and fixed states with the specimen immersed in saline and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 1.5 Tesla superconductive system was used with a multiple spin-echo protocol generating T2 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcortical MRI lesions were localized in three dimensions and identified at brain cutting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, pathological correlations were obtained from an eighth patient who underwent MRI eleven days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations were performed in a blinded fashion, including control areas from the same brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subcortical MRI lesions were found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, dilated perivascular spaces, and vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These histological changes were characteristic of "état criblé" which, like subcortical MRI lesions, is associated with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shrinkage (or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) of the brain parenchyma around ectatic blood vessels would result in an extensive network of tunnels filled with extracellular water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proton MRI signal from such areas of the brain would be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>Gliosis</z:hpo> and small areas of infarction occasionally coexisted with "état criblé," but these were not present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas with MRI lesions and could not be distinguished by MRI signal alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, clinical and pathological correlations lend support to the uniform hypothesis that MRI provides a nonspecific index of brain parenchymal alterations caused by aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
