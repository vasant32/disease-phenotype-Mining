<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stenting is increasingly used as an adjunct to medical therapy in symptomatic intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High periprocedural adverse event rates are one of the limitations of endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from the INTRASTENT multicentric registry should demonstrate in-hospital complications at the current stage of clinical development of the stent procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participating centers entered the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their consecutive intracranial stent procedures into the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, we distinguished <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>/nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (modified Rankin Scale &lt;2), disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> as clinical complications and analyzed whether they were associated with patient- or stenosis-related risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 372 patients with 388 stenoses proved 4.8% disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 2.2% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient or minor events were detected in 5.4% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic events (3.5%) occurred more frequently after treatment of middle cerebral artery stenoses (P=0.004) and were associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> by compromise of perforating branches were detected mainly in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the overall rate of severe adverse events was not dependent from location, degree, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the stenosis or from patient's age, gender, vascular risk factors, or type of qualifying event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complication rates within the registry are within the limits of previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe adverse events were equally distributed between potential risk groups with similar rates but different types of main complications in the anterior and posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
