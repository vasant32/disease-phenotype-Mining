<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study 376 carotid artery plaques (275 symptomatic, 101 asymptomatic) were obtained from endarterectomies (184 unilateral and 96 bilateral) in 280 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gross morphologic features of each plaque were noted at surgery and, together with the patient's clinical history, stored in computer memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were analyzed in order to investigate the relationship of gross morphologic plaque characteristics with both the presence of cerebral symptoms and the degree of stenosis associated with the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ulceration was the most frequently observed of the five major gross plaque morphologic characteristics (46.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques), but only intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (30.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques) was significantly more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> asymptomatic plaques (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> was also the only gross characteristic significantly more common in focal symptomatic plaques when compared with either asymptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05) or nonfocal symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the plaques were divided into three broad degrees of stenosis groups (0-39%, 40-69%, 70-99%) on the basis of angiographic data, only <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> showed a significant correlation in incidence with increased degree of plaque stenosis, both when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques were considered (p less than 0.001) and when only symptomatic plaques were examined (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is the only carotid plaque gross morphologic characteristic significantly more frequent in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic plaques and the only characteristic significantly correlated with increased plaque size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that factors other than plaque ulceration and intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> play an important role in carotid plaque related cerebral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data also raise questions concerning the unequivocal value of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, especially in highly stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
