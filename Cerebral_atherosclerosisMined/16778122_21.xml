<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the principal degradation route of intracellular and oxidized proteins, thus regulating many cellular processes conceivably important for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system in human carotid artery plaques in relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In carotid endarterectomy specimens from 83 asymptomatic and 94 symptomatic patients, content of ubiquitin, ubiquitin conjugates, matrix metalloproteases, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase-p67 was evaluated by immunoblotting; proteolytic proteasome activity by fluorometric assay; single and double immunostaining for ubiquitin conjugates, 3-nitrotyrosine, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and macrophage CD-68, as well as Sirius Red staining for collagen were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients showed a more unstable plaque phenotype, an increased degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, a significantly higher ubiquitin conjugates content (17.72+/-1.36 versus 10.99+/-1.04; P&lt;0.001), and lower proteasome activity (5.01+/-0.70 versus 9.41+/-1.19 nmol AMC/mg protein/min; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin conjugates content was directly correlated to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-p67 and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining revealed colocalization of ubiquitin conjugates and 3-nitrotyrosine, and accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates in smooth muscle cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In human carotid plaques increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is associated with inhibition of the proteasome activity and accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates, particularly in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a possible role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in influencing plaque stability </plain></SENT>
