<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution echography can visualize atheromatous defects on the vessels walls with a resolution better than one mm, whereas Doppler examination detects haemodynamic disturbances due to these plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional Doppler examination can reveal moderate or severe stenosis (greater than 60%); the recent development of frequency analysis of the Doppler audio signal makes now possible the detection of very light haemodynamic disturbances due to low grade stenosis even as small as 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectral distribution abnormalities have been classified in four grades according to their amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of the morphological and functional data provided by echography and Doppler spectrum analysis has drastically increased the diagnostic possibilities of the ultrasound methods in the field of the extracranial vascular pathology </plain></SENT>
