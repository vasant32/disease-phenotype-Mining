<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the association of endothelin (ET)-1 with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and asymptomatic cerebrovascular lesions in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n=293; 138 male, 155 female; mean age, 65 years) and age-matched control subjects (n=242) were studied with B-mode ultrasonography of the common and internal carotid arteries and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma ET-1 was measured by enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive patients were divided into groups with carotid plaques and low ET-1 concentrations (&lt; 0.75 pg/ml; PL group); carotid plaques and mid-range ET-1 (0.75 to 1.55 pg/ml; PM group); carotid plaques and high ET-1 (&gt; or = 1.55 pg/ml; PH group); no plaques and low ET-1 (NPL); no plaques and mid-range ET-1 (NPM); and no plaques and high ET-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, ET-1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaque prevalence was significantly related to ET-1 in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1 showed a significant positive relationship with the number of asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the brain in hypertensive patients with carotid plaques (rho=0.48, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was seen between ET-1 and periventricular hyperintensity scores in patients with plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ET-1 did not show a relationship to either brain lesion type in patients without carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, ET-1 may foster asymptomatic lacunar cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by promoting carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
