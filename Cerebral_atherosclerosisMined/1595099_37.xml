<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that a postprandial accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> promotes the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that postprandial <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> is independently associated with intima-media thickening of the extracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven middle-aged, moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals were recruited for a 1-day study of the lipemic response to a standard high-fat test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The formula was fed at a dose of 65 g fat/m2 body surface area, after a 14-hour fast, and blood was obtained for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> analysis hourly for 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A baseline <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each subject underwent a carotid ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of alimentary <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> (peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response) was correlated with the carotid artery wall thickness as measured by B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analyses indicated an inverse correlation between peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration and a direct correlation with male sex, baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration, background fat intake, and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, the only variable that showed a univariate correlation with B-mode score was peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age and cigarette smoking were also correlated with B-mode score in univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient (r = 0.52) between peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response to a fat-rich meal and B-mode score was significant (p less than 0.002) and remained so in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forward-selection stepwise regression resulted in the inclusion of only peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> response (p = 0.001) and smoking history (p = 0.005) as important predictors of carotid wall thickness in a linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between lipemic response and carotid wall thickness suggests that prolonged exposure of arterial wall cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich chylomicron remnants enhances the atherogenic process </plain></SENT>
