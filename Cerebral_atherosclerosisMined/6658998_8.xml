<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) was more frequently found at autopsy than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH) with a ratio of infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of 4.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small CI occupied 75.7% of the cases with CI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was also reduced, although the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> showed no definite change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decline of CH seemed to be ascribed to the reduction of fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the intracerebral small arteries </plain></SENT>
