<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in 48 subjects, aged 33 to 78, of whom 38 males and 10 females so divided: 6 metabolically healthy controls (N), 10 with vascular cerebral disease (VCD), 15 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject, fasting and without drug treatment at least since 14 hours, after venous blood withdrawal, was given endovenous rapid bolus of 570 lipasemic units of glucuronyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi>-glycan <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (3GS); after 10', 20' and 30' other blood samples were taken; plasma NEFA (colorimetric method) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) (enzyme method) were assayed; C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/TC ratio was calculated and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> value (C-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) according to the Friedwald-Fredrickson's formula was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In controls NEFA increase after 20' (+ 57%) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> drop (-49%) were detected; TC significant fall (-13%, P less than 0,05) after 20' was found, preceded by both C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> marked increase and C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/TC ratio, and followed (30') by C-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> slight rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 3 groups of vascular patients a striking NEFA increase (respectively + 50%, + 43%, + 26%) was found; in subjects with PVD/TG blunted drop was observed, whereas in VCD and in CHD TG percentage fall -41 and -44%) did not differ from that one of controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of their results the Authors believed that in PVD a striking deficit of total plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL), already in vitro documented, may occur, whereas LPL resulted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in VCD and in CHD; on the contrary, in CHD an abnormally cholesterol-apo-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> affinity, like metabolic atherogenic derangement, was found; in the 3 groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> slow peripheral cholesterol removal was detectable </plain></SENT>
