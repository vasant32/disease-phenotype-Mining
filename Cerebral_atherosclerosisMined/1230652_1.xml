<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This vessel as well as other arteries of the circulatory system were examined histologically </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus it turned out that the superficial temporal artery revealed another type of atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A type which exhibited hardly any calcification, but shows an increase of elastic fibers which make <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the vessel possible despite of its thickened wall and primarily narrowed lumen </plain></SENT>
