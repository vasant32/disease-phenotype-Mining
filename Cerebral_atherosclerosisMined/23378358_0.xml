<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a means of preventing secondary ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, angioplasty and stenting are considered potentially beneficial for patients with severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of stenting has been challenged since the publication of the first randomised controlled trial on Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial Stenosis</z:hpo> (SAMMPRIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicated that aggressive medical management was superior to stenting using Wingspan to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, because stenting has a high peri-procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review the management of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, revisit the skepticism on stenting, and state our position on the topic in the form of recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These are based on the prevalence of the disease in Hong Kong, the high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite medical therapy in the presence of haemodynamic intracranial stenosis without sufficient collaterals, an analysis of the weak points of SAMMPRIS, and results of clinical studies in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
