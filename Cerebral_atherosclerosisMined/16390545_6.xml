<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Limited Access Data set were used to estimate the association of age with B-mode ultrasound common carotid artery diameter for three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on information from clinical examinations, B-mode ultrasounds, questionnaires, blood and other tests, participants were categorized into three groups: pre-existing disease (prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>), high risk group (no pre-existing disease, but prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, plaques/shadowing, body mass index &gt; or = 30, current smoking, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>), and a low risk group (no pre-existing disease, no plaques/shadowing, and no major elevated risk factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression analyses modeled the common carotid artery diameter relationship with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age was positively and significantly associated with common carotid artery diameter after risk factor adjustment in the overall sample, but age had a larger effect among persons with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (interaction p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each year of older age was associated with 0.03 mm larger diameter/year among persons with pre-existing disease, with 0.027 mm larger diameter/year in the high risk group, but only 0.017 mm/year among the low risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were qualitatively similar using plaques/shadowing status to indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant impact of age on common carotid artery diameter among low risk, middle-aged, black and white men and women suggests arterial remodelling may occur in the absence of identified risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significantly larger impact of age among persons with, compared to persons without identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or its risk factors, suggests that arterial remodelling may be an indicator of exposure duration </plain></SENT>
