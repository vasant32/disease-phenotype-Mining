<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent deployment may be effective for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis, however its value is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High possibility of serious periprocedural complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, narrows the current recommendations for this treatment to patients with high-grade stenosis (&gt;70%), and to experienced neurointerventional centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We present a 44-year-old male with symptomatic high-grade stenosis of the M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery, treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which resulted in a nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this patient was probably caused by middle cerebral artery perforator ostium occlusion with balloon predilatation and transient in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> related to insufficient antiplatelet pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exhausted cerebrovascular reserve due to long-lasting high-grade intracranial stenosis should also be considered as a factor contributing to ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
