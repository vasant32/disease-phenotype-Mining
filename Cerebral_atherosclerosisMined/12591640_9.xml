<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the angiographic distribution of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the Japanese and Chinese are different from those in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the location and distribution of severe atherosclerotic stenoses in Korean patients by using cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiographic findings in 268 patients (219 male, 49 female; mean age, 56 years) with one or more severe atherosclerotic stenoses (&gt; or =70%), as shown on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were selected from 1436 patients who were examined between 1996 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis focused on the intracranial or extracranial location of the stenosis, the anterior and posterior circulations, and the multiplicity of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by using the chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were then compared with data reported in other races and ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 389 severe stenotic sites were detected in 268 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single stenosis was found in 56 (21%), and multiple stenoses were found in 212 (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesions were located in the intracranial area in 52% and in the extracranial area in 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were detected in anterior circulation in 59% and in posterior circulation in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (66%) of 56 single stenosis were located in the intracranial area, and 19 (34%) were in the extracranial area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 333 lesions, 167 (50%) were multiple stenoses in the extracranial area, and 166 lesions (50%) were located in the intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of intracranial stenosis was significantly higher in the single-stenosis group than in the multiple stenosis group (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Korean patients with severe atherosclerotic stenoses tend to have more intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In particular, those with an isolated stenosis have more intracranial stenoses, compared with those with multiple stenoses </plain></SENT>
