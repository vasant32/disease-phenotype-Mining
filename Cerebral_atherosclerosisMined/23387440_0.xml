<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to evaluate the relationship of atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> (ARAS) with extracranial carotid arteries <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ECAS) and intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was a prospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients with IS who had not a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abdominal aortography was performed to screen for <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> after the cerebrovascular diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of the clinical variables with significant ARAS (≥ 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ARAS was identified in 61 (23.1%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 34 patients (12.9%) had significant ARAS (≥ 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECAS (≥ 70%) and ICAS (≥ 50%) was found in 66 (25%) and 48 (18.2%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with ECAS (≥ 70%) were more likely to have significant ARAS than patients without ECAS (28.8% vs 6.2%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only advanced age (≥ 60 years) (OR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.01-7.91) and ECAS (≥ 70%) (OR = 5.27, 95% CI 2.396-11.60) were independent risk factors for significant ARAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Incidental ARAS is a relatively common finding among patients with IS, and there is a close relationship between ARAS and ECAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abdominal aortography should be performed to identify ARAS in elderly patients with IS, especially combined with severe ECAS </plain></SENT>
