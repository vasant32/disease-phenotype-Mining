<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of complications, both minor and major, associated with modern cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 450 consecutive cerebral angiographic procedures is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient (0.2%) died from a cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven patients (1.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred within 24 hours after the procedure, leading to transient ischemic symptoms in six and permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in three patients without consequence on the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most complications of angiography occurred in patients referred from the neurology department for work-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that morbidity and mortality rates related to the angiographic procedure did not decrease in spite of major improvement of angiographic materiel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is the main risk factor for complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the complications could be avoided by appropriate selection of indications and by using non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance angiography or helical CT angiography </plain></SENT>
