<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used data from the Tinzaparin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Trial (TAIST) to further assess the relationship among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, early recovery, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (&lt;48 hours ictus) and enrolled into TAIST were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity was measured prospectively as the Scandinavian Neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SNSS) at days 0, 4, 7, and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causal subtype as large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), or small vessel occlusion (SVO) was assigned after standard investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of recovery was calculated as the change in SNSS at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index at day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses were performed on the 1190 patients in TAIST who met criteria for LAA, CE, and SVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The largest change in SNSS score occurred between baseline and day 4 and was greatest in SVO (median improvement 4 U), compared with LAA (median improvement 2 U) and CE (median improvement 2 U) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If no improvement in SNSS had occurred by day 4, irrespective of subgroup, then early recovery (median SNSS improvement by day 10: 2) and functional outcome (mRS 4) tended to be limited; patients who recovered early tended to continue to improve (median SNSS improvement by day 10: 11) and had a better outcome at day 90 (median, mRS 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recovery is related to causal subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes most recovery occurred by day 4, and was predictive of longer-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
