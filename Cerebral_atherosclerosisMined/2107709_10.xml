<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler findings in 360 carotid arteries were compared with the results of standard Doppler sonography, and color Doppler findings in 60 bifurcations were compared with the results of intraarterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of color Doppler for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> was 100% when compared with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of color Doppler in classifying minor (40-60%), moderate (61-80%), and severe (81-90%) stenosis ranged from 91.3% to 97.8% vs standard Doppler sonography, and from 91.7% to 95.8% vs angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occlusions were identified correctly by both color Doppler and angiography, four pseudoocclusions of the carotid artery were misdiagnosed as occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characteristic features providing reliable criteria of the degree of stenosis are (1) intensity, extent, and duration of color fading; (2) postprocessed systolic peak frequency; (3) plaque extent on serial sonograms; and (4) poststenotic flow patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Display of hemodynamic disturbances induced by less pronounced plaques showed highly variable patterns that could not be anticipated from the plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, color Doppler preserves the advantages of standard Doppler and duplex sonography but provides additional information about otherwise anechoic necrotic and thrombotic material that often causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With atherogenesis, repair mechanisms may be sustained or progression be stopped by reducing the risk factors and instituting medical treatment; thus, the application of this noninvasive technique is important </plain></SENT>
