<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On brain imaging, lacunes, or cerebrospinal fluid-containing cavities, are common and are often counted in epidemiological studies as old lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of symptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that progress to lacunes is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noncavitating lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may continue to resemble white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with or without an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on computed tomography or MRI, who had follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neuroradiologist classified lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> progressing to definite or possible cavities on follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested associations between cavitation and patient-related, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related, and imaging-related features, including other features of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 90 patients (mean age 67 years), any cavitation was present on follow-up imaging in 25 (28%), and definite cavitation in 18 (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Definite cavitation was associated with increasing time to follow-up imaging (median 228 days, range 54 to 1722, versus no cavitation 72 days, range 6 to 1440; P=0.0003) and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> (P=0.03) but not with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, larger initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, or other features of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were negatively associated with cavitation (P=0.01 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Definite cavitation occurs in one fifth of symptomatic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, implying that most continue to resemble white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidemiology and pathophysiology studies of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which have only counted lacunes as lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, may have substantially underestimated by as much as 5 times the true burden of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
