<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has not been more precisely defined, but risk factors significant for its generation and development, so as for IBD development, have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were designated as risk factors for brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (RFBA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the frequency and significance of RFBA association in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IBD in relation to IBD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The investigation included 60 patients with AIBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RFBA were: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, dyslipoproteinemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients included in the study detailed history was noted, daily glycemia profile was done, blood pressure was measured 3 times a day and parameters of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status with counting of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> indices and Apo A1/Apo B were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IBD was confirmed by computerized tomography of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of IBD severity was determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients by Grotta's scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the statistical processing, the results of the research showed that in the patients with IBD the most frequent were arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, then smoking, dyslipoproteinemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In significant number of patients existed association of several factors, which was in significant positive correlation with the degree of IBD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were simultaneously risk factors for IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IBD is the most severe, final stage in evolution of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
