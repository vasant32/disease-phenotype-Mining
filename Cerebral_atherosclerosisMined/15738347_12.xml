<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elevated blood pressure is among the factors that contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether subjects with MetS and elevated blood pressure are at the same cardiovascular risk as subjects with MetS but without elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this point, we have evaluated the prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in subjects with MetS with or without elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large population was examined (842 women and 1011 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and waist were measured by routine methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was evaluated by echo Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MetS was 24.4% in women and 28.7% in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 35.1% in women and 37.3% in men (p=NS), and increased with increasing number of MetS components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, smoking, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with the presence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (logistic model), whereas age, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and SBP were associated with the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (linear model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When comparing subjects with an equal number of MetS components, the prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in subjects with elevated blood pressure than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> prevalence was found in subjects bearing or not bearing components of the syndrome other than elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present findings demonstrate that subjects with MetS and elevated blood pressure have increased carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with subjects with MetS but without elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of MetS per se might not adequately identify subjects at elevated cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
