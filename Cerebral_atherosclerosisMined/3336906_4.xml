<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is well documented in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a similar relation in two hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys with severe cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our primate model <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is induced by surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These monkeys, when fed an atherogenic diet, develop severe cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this setting two monkeys developed spontaneous cerebral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occurred during treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were topographically related to severe atherosclerotic narrowing of cerebral arteries and occurred without evidence of either <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or embolization, they are presumed to be related to disturbances of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both humans and animals cerebral perfusion is autoregulated to a constant flow over a wide range of mean arterial blood pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> both the upper and lower limits of autoregulation are increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> readaptation to more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels is reported to be inconsistent and slow to develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is therefore postulated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in these two monkeys were due to hypoperfusion as a result of the combination of pharmacologic reduction in blood pressure and severe occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
