<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this analysis we considered: the previous clinical history of factors and illnesses of risk, the certainty of the diagnosis in the emergency room, presenting symptoms, clinical signs, vascular territory, etiopathogenic category and results of cranial computerized axial tomography (CAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, cerebrovascular disease and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> were the commonest clinical features seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was close agreement between the diagnosis made in the emergency room and the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms and clinical signs found in these patients were related to the vascular territory and motor involvement was the most constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was predominance of the carotid territory, especially of the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found predominance of atherothrombotic etiopathogenesis, with fewer cardio-embolic or unknown causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were few abnormal cranial CAT findings in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> localized to the posterior territory </plain></SENT>
