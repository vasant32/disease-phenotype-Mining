<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the same patients, measurements of cerebral <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity were performed using the intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found in symptomatic hemispheres between the CBF/CBV ratio and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had significant increases in OER and this was associated with a reduction in CBF/CBV ratio implying exhaustion of haemodynamic reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity was reduced below 1.5% mm Hg in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases with raised OER but only in two cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivities above 1.5% mm Hg, OER was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that measurements of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity provide a satisfactory method for assessing cerebral haemodynamic reserve </plain></SENT>
