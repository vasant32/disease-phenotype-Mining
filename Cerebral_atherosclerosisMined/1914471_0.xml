<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis identified a first component of severity (Y, P and Z) and a second component of benignity (X and B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrous plaques play the main role in the severity of AL in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The new AS proved its usefulness in characterizing the state of AL, whereas discriminant analysis and AS distinguished between the HAG and the LAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The classification was correct in 74.5% and 76.5% when using three (X, Y, Z) and five (X, Y, Z, P, B) variables, respectively </plain></SENT>
