<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study of the functional state of cerebral hemodynamics using transcranial dopplerography and blood excitotoxic amino acids, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage, has been carried out in 43 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit that developed as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was related to the changes of cerebral hemodynamics (a decrease of hemodynamic reserve and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery) and an increase of the level of blood amino acids involved in excitotoxic mechanisms of the nerve tissue lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These biochemical disturbances in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may be explained by the state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> excitotoxicity that developed because of blood circulation insufficiency in the brain and a decrease of cerebrovascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors admit that genetically determined features of cerebral metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids, concomitant with their higher release to the extracellular space, along with hemodynamical disturbances, may be risk factors of ischemic brain lesion when cerebral blood flow decreased as a result of stenosis or occlusion of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This should be taken into account for elaboration of complex methods of neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the great brain arteries </plain></SENT>
