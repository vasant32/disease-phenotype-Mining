<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The consensus conference on intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) identifies principles of management, and research priorities in various aspects upon which leading experts can agree (using "Delphi" method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICAD is more prevalent in Asian, Hispanic, and African-American populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who have had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) attributed to stenosis (50-99%) of a major intracranial artery face a 12-14% risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the 2-year period after the initial ischemic event, despite treatment with antithrombotic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may exceed 20% in high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical treatment of patients with symptomatic ICAD is directed toward: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of intraluminal thrombo-embolism, 2. plaque stabilization and regression, and 3. management of atherogenic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with ICAD, short-term and long-term anticoagulation (compared with aspirin) have not shown to be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current guidelines recommend that aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and extended release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> monotherapy (rather than oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> acceptable options in patients with non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the subgroup analysis from randomized trials provides evidence about benefit of aggressive atherogenic risk factor management among patients with ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement has evolved as a therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic ICAD, particularly those with high-grade stenosis with recurrent ischemic symptoms and/or medication failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A matched comparison between medical-treated patients in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) study and stent-treated patients in the National Institutes of Health intracranial stent registry concluded that stent placement may offer benefit in patients with 70-99% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year, multicenter, prospective, randomized Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Intracranial Stenosis study supported by the National Institutes of Health is currently comparing stent placement with intense medical management with intense medical management alone in patients with high-grade symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proceedings of the consensus conference provide a template for standardizing management of patients with ICAD and determining research priorities </plain></SENT>
