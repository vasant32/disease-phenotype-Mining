<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study hemodynamic and morphometric consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were examined in cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> augments cerebral vasoconstrictor responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 8 atherosclerotic monkeys, which were fed an atherogenic diet for 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphometric studies indicated marked intimal proliferation of extracranial carotid arteries, with only modest reduction in the vascular lumen, as <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were displaced outward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured with microspheres and microvascular pressure was measured with a micropipette in pial arteries approximately 350 microns diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reduced microvascular pressure, which indicates constriction of large arteries upstream, but cerebral blood flow did not decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> produced a 2-fold greater reduction in cerebral microvascular pressure in atherosclerotic monkeys than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> increased flow and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> reduced flow in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys, without altering cerebral microvascular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude: First, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> potentiates constrictor responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because platelets release <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> when they aggregate, augmentation of responses by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may have implications for cerebral vascular responses during aggregation of platelets at carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Second, despite marked proliferation of intima, <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> are displaced outward during a prestenotic phase of the disease, so that the lumen is relatively well preserved </plain></SENT>
