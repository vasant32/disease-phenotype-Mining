<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the accuracy of CTA with DSA in the assessment of a fetal origin of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom an intracranial DSA and CTA had been performed were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fetal origin was defined as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized patent posterior communicating artery (PCoA) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of the ipsilateral P1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> in 51 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fetal origin was present in ten vessels (10%, eight patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTA revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTA considered an additional three vessels as having a fetal origin, while DSA revealed a PCoA with the same diameter as the P1 segment of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of CTA in the assessment of a fetal origin could be estimated at 100 and 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values were 77 and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CTA can be considered a valid diagnostic tool for the assessment of a fetal origin of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in patients with a cerebral ischemic event in the territory of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
