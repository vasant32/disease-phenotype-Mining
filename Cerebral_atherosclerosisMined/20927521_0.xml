<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven patients underwent 69 single-stent procedures successfully for atherosclerotic stenosis ≥70% in the M1 segment of middle cerebral artery were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were classified into two groups: nonresidual (≤30%) and residual (&gt;30%) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influence of residual stenosis immediately after stent placement on clinical outcomes and restenosis at follow-up was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was defined as ≥20% stenosis on angiographic follow-up imaging after excluding postoperative residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between groups, it was no difference in the conventional risk factors of cerebrovascular diseases, characteristics of targeted vessels, and types of stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The residual stenosis had no influence on any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but the ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a trend in the residual stenosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of restenosis was higher in patients with residual stenosis &gt;30% (17% vs. 45.5%, P = 0.04), and the increase of percent stenosis was 7.9 ± 11.7 and 17.1 ± 15.4, respectively (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient was r = 0.37 (P &lt; 0.01) between the residual stenosis and the increase of percent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that residual stenosis &gt;30% was an independent risk factor for restenosis at follow-up (log-rank, Chi-square = 6.09, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Residual stenosis immediately after stenting for atherosclerotic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may be a predictor of clinical outcomes and restenosis at follow-up </plain></SENT>
