<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the possibility that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression level of TGFbeta1 in smooth-muscle cells cultured from the superficial temporal arteries (STAs) and measured the serum level of TGFbeta1 by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the STA is not predominantly involved with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, it has been used in studies of the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, the STAs from six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and four with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, along with sera from 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of TGFbeta1 was significantly higher in cultured smooth-muscle cells derived from the STAs of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> than in those derived from the STAs of patients with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum level of TGFbeta1 was also significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> than in controls (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the functional roles of TGFbeta1 in the expression of connective tissue genes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, these investigators suggest that TGFbeta1 is associated with the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, including abundant neovascularization, although their findings do not necessarily mean that TGFbeta1 is a causative factor in this disease </plain></SENT>
