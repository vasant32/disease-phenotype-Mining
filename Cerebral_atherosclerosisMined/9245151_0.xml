<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis of correlations between clinical and computer tomographical symptoms of DE on the one hand and the indices of central hemodynamics, head blood circulation and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of head arteria on the other hand was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in head venous system was the main factor in DE development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was made that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of head arteria and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> promoted venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in head by means of decreasing the amplitude of arterial pulsation and in turn the development of DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the increase of minute blood flow prevents it </plain></SENT>
