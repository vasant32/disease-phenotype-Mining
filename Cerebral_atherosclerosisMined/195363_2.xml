<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new method for assessment of platelet sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-aggregation was devised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its reproducibility and the correlations between the values obtained by this method, the optical density (O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>D.) method, and the screen filtration pressure (SFP) method were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In summary, this method may be said to have three main points: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can be performed without centrifugation, avoiding mechanical stress to platelets, using only 0.8 ml. of blood and inexpensive equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may reflect different aspects of platelet function from the O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>D. method and the SFP method, despite the positve significant correlations between the values obtained by these three methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was proved to be highly reproducible and is thought to be useful clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By using this method, the effect of sustained isometric exercise by handgripping on platelet aggregability was assessed in coronary sclerotic and cerebral arteriosclerotic patients on placebo and EG-626, a newly synthesized cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On placebo, an enhancement platelet sensitivity was observed after isometric exercise in coronary and cerebral arteriosclerotic patients but not in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The enhancement was prevented by pretreatment of EG-626, administered orally 1.5 hours prior to exercise </plain></SENT>
