<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out on 49 patients who underwent an ultrasound study by continuous Doppler and echotomography B real-time, an angiography of supra-aortic arteries, and a carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 20 a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantification of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in 4 stages was established for each method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For detection of lesion an excellent correlation was observed between the results of echotomography and pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the quantification of lesion the correlation between echotomography and pathology was excellent also in 79,7 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>100 of the cases, discordant in 20,3 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was similar to the correlation between arteriography and pathology (excellent in 83 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>100 of the cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation with pathology enabled to distinguish for stages of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, to clarify their type of complications, and to evaluate their functional significance, particularly those with a high risk of embolism </plain></SENT>
