<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a first analysis, we correlated risk factors and cardiovascular symptoms with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that relations between many continuous risk factors and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were graded and consistent for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified 6 significant variables (age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, pack-years smoked, and inversely, plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and Framingham Type A score) that together accounted for 35% of the variability in extent of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second multivariate analysis, addition of coronary status (presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> as evaluated by coronary angiography) to the roster of candidate independent variables produced a new equation that accounted for an additional 5% of the variability in carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although much of the variability in extent of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> remains unexplained, these data define an association between coronary and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> that depends partly on shared exposure of both arteries to the same risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They are also consistent with the concept that as yet undiscovered risk factors and/or genetic (e.g., arterial wall) factors common to both arterial beds also contribute to the relation between coronary and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in human beings </plain></SENT>
