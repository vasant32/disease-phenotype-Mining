<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 plaque specimens removed at carotid endarterectomy were scanned transversely at intervals of 1 mm, and compared to tissue cross-sections examined by optical microscopy employing computer-assisted planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UTC was performed by spectral analysis of backscattered radiofrequency signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slope, intercept and total power parameters of the spectrum were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis was used to compare the ability of the UTC spectral parameters and morphological constituents to correctly classify plaques according to their symptom group membership </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UTC correctly classified 88.2% of the plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> was present in 93.9% of the plaques, and there was little difference in the morphological constituents of plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphological constituents correctly classified 60.7% of the plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude, in this preliminary study, that UTC can discriminate between carotid plaques from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with moderate accuracy, despite a similarity in their morphological composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>UTC discrimination is not related to differences in the type or amount of morphological constituents in the plaques </plain></SENT>
