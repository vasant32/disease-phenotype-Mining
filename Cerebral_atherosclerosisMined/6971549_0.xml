<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two blood specimens were taken (from the femoral artery and the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein) at the peak of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An activation of the kallikrein-kinin system was revealed, the degree of which was found to depend on the gravity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the initial stages of the disease a moderate activation of the kallikrein-kinin system was noted, the fact, that was, probably, favourable for improvement of the blood circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible pathogenetic mechanisms (<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, lowering of the medium pH, etc.) of the system activation are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For treating patients who were in a soporous-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state with a sharp drop of the kallikrein activity in the cerebral venous blood it was recommended to use drugs blocking the excess formation of kinins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the initial stage of the disease development such an intervention should be regarded undesirable </plain></SENT>
