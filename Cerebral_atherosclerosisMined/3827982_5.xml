<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the cerebral vessels was quantified using extracranial and intracranial cerebrovascular scores (ECS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>) based on the number and severity of the lesions in 11 extracranial and 21 intracranial arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of univariate and multivariate analyses indicate that the presence of atherosclerotic changes of cerebral vessels, as shown by angiography, was strongly related with age in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions were more frequent in males, in particular under age 55 </plain></SENT>
