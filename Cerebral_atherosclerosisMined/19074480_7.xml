<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unstable atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by increased macrophages and reduced smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and collagen content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoglin, an accessory transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) receptor, is a modulator of TGFbeta signaling recently found to be expressed on SMCs in atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its function in plaque SMCs and plaque development is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early growth response-1 (EGR-1), a transcription factor downstream of TGFbeta, stimulates SMC proliferation and collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, it is mainly expressed by SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the TGFbeta, endoglin, and EGR-1 pathway in advanced atherosclerotic plaques in relation to plaque phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human carotid atherosclerotic plaques (n=103) were collected from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, plaques were analyzed for plaque characteristics, ie, collagen, macrophage and SMC content, and intraplaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque endoglin, pSmad (indicative for TGFbeta signaling), EGR-1, and TGFbeta levels were analyzed using Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher endoglin and EGR-1 protein levels correlated positively with increased plaque collagen levels, increased smooth muscle cell content, and decreased intraplaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> as well as TGFbeta signaling (pSmad) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although EGR-1 overexpression in vitro stimulated collagen synthesis, inhibiting endoglin resulted in lower EGR-1 levels, decreased SMC proliferation, and decreased collagen content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TGFbeta in human atherosclerotic plaques is active and signals through the TGFbeta/Smad pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we show a strong association between endoglin and EGR-1, increased collagen and SMCs expression, decreased levels of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and a stable plaque phenotype </plain></SENT>
