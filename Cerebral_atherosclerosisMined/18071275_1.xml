<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain perfusion SPECT images obtained at baseline and after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were reconstructed using statistical parametric mapping in 23 patients, both before and after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes of the surgery were also recorded and compared with the hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A voxel with an uncorrected p-value of less than 0.001 was considered to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPECT images of the territory supplied by the bypass graft showed an increase in both cerebrovascular flow and reserve at baseline, and the increase was significantly higher following the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed improvement of clinical symptoms and increased blood flow to the left temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices as well as the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain SPECT effectively and objectively demonstrated the improved outcomes of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery, and thus may be used in postoperative analyses </plain></SENT>
