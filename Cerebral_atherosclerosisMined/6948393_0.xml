<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Red cell flexibility (RCF) was studied in 40 patients with severe occlusive arterio-sclerotic disease of the lower extremities (Group I) and in 17 patients with aortic or mitral valve prosthesis (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCF was studied in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and fragility using a filtration method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pentoxifylline, which according to our previous observations increases the flexibility of red cells in healthy subjects, also markedly improved RCF in Group I, particularly in terms of fragility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pentoxifylline-induced increase in RCF was less marked in Group II; only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> parameter was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reid et al [11] reported decreased deformability of red cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since then a few other studies have been published, in which decreased red cell flexibility (RCF) was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular disease</z:e> [1, 4, 9, 12] and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> [10] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare RCF in patients with widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and heart valve prosthesis, the latter condition inducing a 'pure' mechanical red cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patient groups were also studied after the administration of pentoxifylline, a drug known to improve the flexibility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> red cells--see [6] </plain></SENT>
