<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two communities in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 1,917 African-American and white men and women 55 to 72 years old who were selected from the second follow-up examination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The lung function indexes, FEV1 and FVC, were assessed according to American Thoracic Society criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and WMLs were assessed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, ethnicity, gender, height, and height squared, a 1-SD decrease of FEV1 in nonsmokers was associated with odds ratios (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31 to 2.03) of 1.63 for infarction and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.69) for WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those in the lowest quartile of FEV1, 15% had infarction and WMLs, in contrast to 6% of the individuals in the uppermost quartile of FEV1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent associations were also observed by using FVC as an index of pulmonary function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of association were found among current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The associations were not altered by additional adjustment of conventional risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, comorbidity, or cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from this population-based study suggest that lower pulmonary function is associated with subclinical cerebral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
