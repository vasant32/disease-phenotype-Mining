<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this survey is to evaluate the current status of adherence to secondary prevention guidelines based on evidence-based medicine and related lifestyle modifications, both at hospital discharge and 90 days after discharge for inpatients with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The survey enrolled patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, from seven hospitals in Beijing consecutively from 1 October 2006 to 1 May 2007, and was designed to record detailed information including ACEI/ARB, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, anti-platelet agent therapy, carotid endarterectomy, angioplasty or stent, smoking and weight control behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred and eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> inpatients had been enrolled over the past 7 months from the year of 2006 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> that have not taken any anti-platelet agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and ACEI/ARB were 0.4, 41.8 and 63.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent of the total patients have not followed the instructions on quitting tobacco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and eighty-eight patients who are suitable to have drug therapy were followed up 90 day after discharge: 26.9% have not adhered to anti-platelet agents; 52.6% have not been treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, and 59.4% have not had ACEI/ARB to lower blood pressure </plain></SENT>
