<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic stenosis of large intracranial arteries, especially the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), is a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the morphological features of atherosclerotic stenosis in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and to investigate their relationship with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from a postmortem series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the morphological features of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in consecutive postmortem adults aged 45 years or above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were evaluated by a single observer blinded to the clinical history: (1) thickness of fibrous cap; (2) extent of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> area; (3) degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis; (4) presence of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, neovasculature, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A semiquantitative assessment of macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration was made by immunohistochemical staining for CD68 and CD45RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six cases were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaques of more than 40% cross-sectional area <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing stenosis were found in 69 MCAs (45.4%, 69/152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis, the percentage of the plaques containing more than 40% <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> area and the prevalence of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, neovasculature and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> were higher in those plaques associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and the mean index of both CD45RO and CD68 was higher among those associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression showed that stenosis (p = 0.003; odds ratio, OR = 1.050), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> area (p = 0.048, OR = 1.698) and presence of neovasculature (p = 0.040, OR = 3.471) were independent risk factors of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque, percentage of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> area and presence of intraplaque neovasculature may play a key role in leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
