<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had ischaemic brain symptoms and stenoses of more than 60% (calculated angiographically) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated four patients by <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for residual stenoses after thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> balloon catheters 2.0-3.5 mm in diameter for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a rule, the balloon was inflated for 1 min at 6 atm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arteries were successfully dilated (stenosis less than 50%) except for one treated by <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for residual <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient died of a massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> reocclusion caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stenosis recurred in 4 of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was successfully carried out in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, stenosis recurred in one of these patients 3 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, but the patient is being followed because he is asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> of intracranial arteries is effective, but its indications should be based strictly on potential risks, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
