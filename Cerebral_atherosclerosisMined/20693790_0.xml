<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial flow velocity changes on transcranial Doppler can reflect changes in cerebral flow during position-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> if obtained during short-term monitoring of positional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Our multicenter group monitored symptomatic and asymptomatic arteries in patients with recurrent neurological deficits during positional changes and documented intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral posterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries were monitored dependent on clinical symptom localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptomatic artery was monitored distal to the intracranial stenosis, and mean flow velocities (MFV) were recorded at different body positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The symptomatic artery relative MFV ratio was defined as the ratio of symptomatic artery MFV in the asymptomatic position--MFV in the symptomatic position/MFV in the asymptomatic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent transcranial Doppler monitoring: mean age 62 +/- 19 years, 11 (69%) men, 6 (40%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (63%) had posterior and 6 anterior circulation symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients developed neurological symptoms while standing up (63%) and/or sitting (44%), walking (13%) or during neck extension (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic artery MFV dropped by &gt; or =25% from the resting to the symptomatic position in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except for one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean symptomatic artery MFV relative ratio was higher compared with the mean asymptomatic artery MFV relative ratio: 0.5 +/- 0.28 versus -0.02 +/- 0.1 (p = 0.001, Wilcoxon test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The symptomatic artery relative ratio of &gt;0.25 had a 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity for predicting neurological symptom development during testing (kappa = 0.9, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in intracranial flow velocity distal to an intracranial stenosis can identify patients whose symptoms can worsen with positional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients may prove a target for interventional revascularization techniques </plain></SENT>
