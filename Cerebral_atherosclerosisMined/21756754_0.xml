<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2007 and November 2009, 42 patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> registered in Nanjing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry program (NSRP) were treated with Wingspan stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and follow-up results were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into the non-restenosis and restenosis groups according to their follow-up imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ISR was defined as &gt; 50% stenosis within 5 mm or adjacent to stent or an absolute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss &gt; 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis of stepwise multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the independent predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISR was found in 15 patients (15/42, 35.7%) with 16 lesions (16/43, 37.2%) at a median follow-up period of 7 months (range: 4 - 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (HR = 0.281; 95%CI = 0.088 - 0.898; P = 0.032) and stent diameter (HR = 0.213; 95%CI = 0.049 - 0.918; P = 0.038) were two independent predictors for ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and stent diameter may be two independent predictors for ISR after a treatment of Wingspan system </plain></SENT>
