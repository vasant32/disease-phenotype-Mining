<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most classifications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> subgroups and therefore are of limited value for comparative studies or clinical protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The view is held that a classification according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology is clinically more reasonable and more consistent for therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the frequency of various etiological subgroups in a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, the results of the Klosterneuburger Schlaganfall-Datenbank (KSDB) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry has prospectively recorded over 300 items on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases referred to one center since March 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation rates include CT in almost 100% and the investigation of cerebral vessels in over 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By applying defined etiological categories (undetermined etiology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the large craniocervical vessels, cardiogenic embolism, lacunar, primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and multiple and other causes) to the first 420 patients registered within the first two years it can be shown that even with CT and neurosonology in routine use, in 29% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cannot be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate this largest subgroup by means of additional new methods as well as by investigating the long-term natural course represents an important challenge for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
