<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A basic review of the extensive literature focusing on the major risk factors of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, i.e., elevation of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> related to diet, blood pressure elevation, and genetic factors using the traditional epidemiological model of interaction between host, agent, and environment, has strongly supported the concept that diet and particularly saturated fat and/or cholesterol are significant contributors to the elevation of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, especially cholesterol, and contribute importantly to the premature development and mortality of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certainly genetics exert an important impact on this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date it remains unclear whether or not major changes in the dietary pattern of huge population groups can be practically effected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minor dietary modifications so far studied in the average <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-prone population cannot be anticipated to make a major dent in the epidemic proportions of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is quite clear that prospective preventive medicine must be implemented at a very early age in the pediatric age group, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is now recognized by many as the number one pediatric problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tremendous biochemical advances have provided new insights in knowledge regarding the transport of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, particularly cholesterol, and the regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level for cholesterol under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circumstances and in the genetic influenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemias</z:hpo> (TABLE 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A bright future lies ahead for the reduction of the epidemic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> which could be greatly enhanced by a greater personal responsibility for health care and a much more careful and prudent diet selection and exercise managment </plain></SENT>
