<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using these non-invasive tests, the functional impact of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis and the morphological changes resulting from arteriosclerotic deformities could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in comparison with a reference group of 199 patients with a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the HCSS group, 5 patients had a stenosis of more than 50% at the origin of the internal carotid artery on both sides, or on one side in combination with large plaques or a complete occlusion on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five per cent of patients in the HCSS group, as compared to only 23.5% of the control group, had effective arteriosclerotic changes in the carotid bifurcation on both sides; 4 patients had such changes only unilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked additional bilateral arteriosclerotic depositions were detected in the common carotid arteries of 17 patients (47.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients no arteriosclerotic lesions were detectable in the carotid bifurcations, but marked changes were found in both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that bilateral arteriosclerotic changes in the carotid bifurcations and/or the common carotid arteries represent an important pathophysiological factor for the development of an HCSS </plain></SENT>
