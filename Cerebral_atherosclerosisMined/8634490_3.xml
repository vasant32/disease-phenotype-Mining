<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of imaging cerebral arteries in vitro with intravascular ultrasound and to establish a correlation between echographic images and corresponding histological architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed using a 30-MHz, 4.3F ultrasound probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two arterial segments were obtained at autopsy from 6 patients and were imaged fresh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteries were then processed for histological examination and comparisons were made between echographic and histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area measurements as determined histologically and by intravascular ultrasound was tested by linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound demonstrated a three-layered appearance in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries but not in those affected by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, ultrasound correctly identified the presence of a plaque in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 100 and 80% for calcium deposits and 83 and 75% for fibrous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound and histological measurements correlated well for the determination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area (r = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound provides accurate characterization of the arterial lumen and geometry, as well as the presence and histological features of atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears to have a great potential for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and may serve to guide new interventional techniques being utilized in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
