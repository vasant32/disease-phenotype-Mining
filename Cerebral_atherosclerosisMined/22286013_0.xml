<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients may have concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection and treatment of preclinical CAD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may improve long-term outcome and survival because CAD is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, association between coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients has not fully been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at examining the frequency and high-risk groups of CAD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who were admitted due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> between July 2006 and June 2010 were prospectively enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,304 patients who underwent MSCT coronary angiography and cerebral angiography were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using 64-multislice computed tomography coronary angiography, we investigated the frequency of CAD and association between coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in terms of location and burden (severity and extent) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also sought to identify high-risk groups for CAD among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of significant (≥50%) CAD was 32.3% and the frequency of any degree of CAD was 70.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, serum levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and significant stenosis of the extracranial carotid, intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries were independently associated with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no association was found between CAD and significant stenosis of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between CAD and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was stronger with increased severity and extent of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When compared to patients with &lt;2 risk factors and without significant cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, those with multiple (≥2) risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in both the carotid and the vertebrobasilar arteries had very high risks of CAD [odds ratio (OR) 8.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.15-16.87] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk was also high in patients with multiple risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in either the carotid or the vertebrobasilar artery (OR 4.13; 95% CI 2.62-6.51), and in those with &lt;2 risk factors but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in both the carotid and the vertebrobasilar arteries (OR 3.40; 95% CI 1.22-9.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A substantial portion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had preclinical CAD, and there was a clear relationship between coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in terms of location and burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The risk of CAD was particularly high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with multiple risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the carotid and/or vertebrobasilar arteries </plain></SENT>
