<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (n = 50) and PAD (n = 33) were treated with pentoxifylline (400 mg, thrice a day) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after drug therapy the hemorheological measurements including plasma and whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation (RBCA) and deformability (RBCD) were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro study RBCs were incubated with: 1) Vinpocetine--inhibitor PDE-1, 10 μM; 2) Rolipram--PDE-4, 10 μM; 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30356">Isobutyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi>)--nonselective PDE inhibitor, 100 μM and with pentoxifylline, 10 μM The cell incubation was performed at 37 °C for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were the positive changes of hemorheological profile after 4 weeks of the pentoxifylline therapy both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and PAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The marked RBCD changes were observed after the in vitro cell pentoxifylline treatment as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perhaps it is connected with the inhibition of the phosphodiesterase activity in RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An application of drugs and chemicals that can inhibit the PDE activity resulted in RBCD rise and RBCA decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The experiments with the use of selective PDE inhibitors have revealed the similar red cell deformability changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vinpocetine increased RBCD significantly (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PDE-4 inhibitor--Rolipram stimulated RBCD by 15% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some more effective was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34795,48518">IBMX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After cell incubation with it a significant rise of the deformability (by 27%; p &lt; 0.05) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drugs, having PDE activity decreased RBCA, but the most pronounced effect had Vinpocetine (50%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, administered pentoxifylline, daily (1200 mg), during four weeks improves hemorheological profile and especially its microrheological part as well as the blood transport capacity in subjects with cerebral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pvd">peripheral vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is most probably red cell microrheological control mechanisms may be associated with the phosphodiesterase activity alterations </plain></SENT>
