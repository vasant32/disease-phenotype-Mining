<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With coronary revascularization, drug-eluting stents have significantly decreased the incidence of in-stent stenosis and, therefore, the morbidity of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Restenosis is potentially a significant problem for neurovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore report our institutional experience on the use of drug-eluting stents for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a period of 2 years, 19 patients underwent extra- and intracranial drug-eluting stent placement for intra- and extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 12 males and seven females aged between 36 and 83 years old (mean 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, and three taxus-coated stents were placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were five intracranial internal carotid arteries, two intracranial vertebral arteries, three mid-basilar, six of vertebral artery origin and three middle cerebral artery stents utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one case of re-stenosis associated with recurrent symptoms requiring repeat drug eluting stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other patients have developed new or recurrent neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of six vertebral artery origin stents were placed with distal protection to prevent embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial and extracranial drug-eluting stent placement appears to be a safe alternative to the medical management of atherosclerotic disease of the vertebrobasilar and carotid systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further randomized studies are needed to examine the effectiveness and safety of this procedure </plain></SENT>
