<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A descriptive study of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in human intracranial arteries was undertaken using both light and electron microscopic technics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial segments of human middle cerebral, internal carotid and basilar arteries with gross fatty streak lesions were obtained at autopsy within 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, fixed and embedded in plastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new technic has been developed in which 0.5 mu-thick sections can be stained with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>/alcian blue, thereby enabling clear differentiation, substantiated by simultaneous electron microscopic studies, between the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-filled smooth muscle cell, which is surrounded by a <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive basement membrane, and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-filled blood monocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These technics demonstrated that the gross fatty streak comprised a focal intimal thickening bordered on the lumen by a patent endothelial lining and on the media by a usually intact elastic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion contained smooth muscle cells and cells presumed to be blood monocytes, both filled with and devoid of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although little fragmented or new elastica was found in the extracellular space, numerous foci of membranous material could be observed, believed to be cell debris and plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similarity between the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of such lesions in intracranial arteries with those found in other arterial beds suggests that the documented differences in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the various beds has no bearing on either the structure of each type of lesion or its progression </plain></SENT>
