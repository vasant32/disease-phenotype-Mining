<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In-stent restenosis (ISR) after angioplasty/stenting for intracranial stenosis has been reported in up to 25% to 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection and monitoring of ISR relies primarily on serial catheter angiography, because noninvasive imaging methods are typically hampered by stent-related artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the value of serial vessel flow measurements using quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) in detection of ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Material and METHODS: Records of patients undergoing stenting for intracranial symptomatic stenosis &gt;50% between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic images were graded by a blinded neurointerventionalist for stenosis pretreatment, immediately after treatment, and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow in the affected vessel measured by QMRA was recorded; &gt; 25% reduction in flow was considered indicative of an adverse change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data regarding neurological outcome were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients underwent stenting during the time interval studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 patients (mean age, 55.5 years; 8 female) had contemporaneous angiography and QMRA and were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (50%) demonstrated angiographic restenosis 2 to 12 months after treatment; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had an analogous decrease in flow in the vessel of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 3 patients with more severe flow decrement (&gt; 50%), 2 experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients without angiographic ISR demonstrated a flow decrease on QMRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary series, flow decrease on QMRA is highly predictive of angiographic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the degree of flow decrement correlates with symptomatic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>QMRA may provide a useful noninvasive tool for serial monitoring after intracranial stenting </plain></SENT>
