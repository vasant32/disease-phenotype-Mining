<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were treated with a single dose of 1.5 x 10(4) U/kg urokinase as intravenous thrombolytic therapy within 6 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decrease degree of nerve function defect integral, the cure rate, the effectual rate, and the total effective rate were observed 3 h and 21 days after thrombolysis, respectively, and the results were compared with those of conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of patients treated with the two therapies were compared 21 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The nerve function defect integral examined 3 h after thrombolysis (14.2 +/- 2.1) was markedly lower than that before thrombolysis (26.5 +/- 9.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A remarkable difference (n = 31, t = 4.669, P &lt; 0.05) was noticed between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cure rate and effectual rate reached 22.58% (7/31) and 67.74% (21/31), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease degree of nerve function defect integral, the cure rate, the effectual rate and the total effective rate evaluated 21 days after thrombolysis were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher than those of conventional therapy group (from 26.5 +/- 9.1 to 8.8 +/- 2.8 vs from 26.4 +/- 8.1 to 16.3 +/- 4.1, t = 2.417; 51.61% vs 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>38%, chi(2) = 5.037; 70.96% vs 42.30%, chi(2) = 4.765; 87.09% vs 65.38%, chi(2) = 3.886, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was markedly smaller than that of the conventional therapy group (3.7 cm 3 +/- 3.0 cm(3) vs 5.3 cm(3) +/- 3.1 cm(3), t = 2.165, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ultra-early intravenous thrombolysis with a single dose of 1.5x10(4) U/kg urokinase in the treatment of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has a better clinical curative effect and less complication, and it can also have the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
