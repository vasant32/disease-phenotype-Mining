<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was a distinct increase in blood viscosity which was induced by disturbances of cell rheological factors: increase in aggregation of erythrocytes and decrease in their deformability were observed in comparison with indices in the group of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment with Ascovertin in patients with discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> improved their attention, memory, mental performance, normalized sleep, releaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, decreased fatiquebility, led to the decrease in blood viscosity values, the reduction of pathological erythrocyte hyper aggregation and the improvement of erythrocyte deformability </plain></SENT>
