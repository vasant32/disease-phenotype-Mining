<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The signaling protein CD40 and its ligand, CD40L, are thought to contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine their utility as markers of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 82 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) and classified each as having largeartery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA, 30), small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (36), or cardioaortic embolism (16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also recruited 17 patients who had carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (CAS) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 20 healthy individuals as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD40L expression on peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) was detected by direct immunofluorescence with flow cytometry, and serum soluble CD40L (sCD40L) was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD40L expression on PBMCs was highest in the LAA group, followed by that in the CAS group (both P&lt;0.01 versus control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also higher in patients with atherosclerotic infarction than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PBMC CD40L expression was sensitive and specific for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and LAA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and was superior to serum C-reactive protein for predicting cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum sCD40L was higher in patients with ACI than in healthy controls (P&lt;0.01) or patients with CAS (P&lt;0.01) and correlated with increased disability on three scales (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with ACI have an upregulated CD40-CD40L system, which could be used as a clinical biomarker for assessing atherosclerotic instability and severity of neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
