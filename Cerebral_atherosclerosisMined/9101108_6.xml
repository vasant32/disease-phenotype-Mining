<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obtained by autopsy 17 cases with XGCP and 21 cases with XCP were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Foamy cells were confirmed to be constitutional for both lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically their antigen profile was shown to be of histiocytic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">siderosis</z:e> emerged as a consistent feature of XGCP but not of XCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In no case both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were found associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinical data revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 15 out of 17 cases with XCP but in only 3 out of 13 cases with XGCP (p &lt; 0.01; in 4 cases of each sample pertinent data were pending) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 14:3 in cases with XGCP and 13:8 in cases with XCP; when combined with data of other authors the male preponderance in XGCP became statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, XGCP and XCP emerged as different independent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>XCP appeared to be closely related for example to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010874'>tendon xanthomas</z:hpo> of the skin which are well established as being diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>XGCP, on the other hand, are most likely to correspond to cholesterol granulomas of extracranial provenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data presented strongly recommend the replacement of the term "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333407" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xanthogranuloma</z:e> of choroid plexus" with the term "cholesterol granuloma of choroid plexus" </plain></SENT>
