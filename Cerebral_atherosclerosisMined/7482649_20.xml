<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined blood flow velocity with TCD in the middle cerebral artery and cerebrovascular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> responses to carbon dioxide in 22 patients with or without carotid artery occlusive disease and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; we compared the results with the measurements of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow velocity measured by TCD correlated with ipsilateral cerebral blood flow measured by PET in frontal, temporal, and striatal regions and throughout the entire hemisphere (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative changes in blood flow velocity and calculated cerebrovascular resistance tested by carbon dioxide inhalation both correlated closely with regional mean transit time (calculated as the ratio of cerebral blood volume divided by cerebral blood flow) in frontal, striatal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions and also in the entire hemisphere (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD variables did not correlate with hemispheric measurements of oxygen metabolism by PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although TCD is not useful in assessing impairments of cerebral metabolism, it is useful for detecting abnormalities of cerebral hemodynamics among patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
