<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This aging-P300 interaction can best be approximated by third-order polynomial regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To delineate the clinical impact this special kind of regression function may have on detecting early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e>, we applied visual P300 potential data of healthy subjects (n = 344; age range, 18-98 years) to nondemented patients with either (i) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (n = 104; age range, 19-74 years) or (ii) cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (n = 80; age range, 38-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with linear regressions, third-order polynomial regressions for the age-related changes in P300 potential latencies showed a smaller latency increase during middle age, with an accelerating latency prolongation from age 60 onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, third-order polynomial regressions yielded a rate of abnormal P300 potential latencies exceeding that of linear regressions absolutely by 17-21%, and relatively by 67-71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of P300 abnormalities was much lower in the CAD patients with either regression model, the relative increase in P300 abnormalities due to third-order polynomial regressions was 40-112.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data for the latencies of P300 potentials based on third-order polynomial regressions result in a higher sensitivity of P300 potentials for detecting early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This gain in diagnostically important information is not offset by a loss in specificity, and may depend on the kind as well as stage of the disease, the age distribution of the patients and the degree of the P300 potential abnormalities </plain></SENT>
