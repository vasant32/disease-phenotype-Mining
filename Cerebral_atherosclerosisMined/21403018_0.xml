<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the vessel wall imaging findings and enhancement patterns in the middle cerebral artery of patients with presumed atherosclerotic disease and recent infarction in the territory of the affected artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We included patients with (1) 2 or more risk factors for atherosclerotic disease; (2) middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> shown on computed tomography, magnetic resonance, or conventional angiography; and (3) recent infarction in the territory of the affected artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: 3-T contrast-enhanced high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients were identified: 6 had an eccentric M1 stenosis, 1 had an eccentric proximal M2 stenosis, and 1 had a distal M2 stenosis with inconclusive eccentricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of the lesion was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent scanning within 5 months of the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four intracranial atherosclerotic plaques were found in asymptomatic vessels (1 contralateral middle cerebral artery and 3 other intracranial arteries), and none of these had enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with presumed intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral arteries have eccentric plaques that enhance after the administration of contrast medium when imaging is performed within weeks to months of a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> within the arterial territory </plain></SENT>
