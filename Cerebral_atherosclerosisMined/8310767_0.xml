<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The carotid arteries of twenty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> were examined by conventional angiography, the ultrasonic duplex technique and supraorbital <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (SOFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of the last two techniques (non-invasive and minimally invasive, respectively) were compared with the results of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the ultrasonic duplex technique is highly sensitive and specific for both high and low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> while the less costly SOFA can only identify stenoses equal to or more than 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, since tight stenosis has proved to be an indication for surgical reconstruction, SOFA - or possibly the still simpler procedure with direct ocular inspection of the supraorbital fluorescence pattern without any recording - would be useful for initial screening in smaller units without access to ultrasonic duplex examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this way potential candidates for surgery can be identified without delay and forwarded to larger units for further supplementary examinations </plain></SENT>
