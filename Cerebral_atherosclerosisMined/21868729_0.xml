<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apoB)/apoAI ratio is recognized as a better indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> than other cholesterol measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether intracranial or extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is more closely associated with an increased apoB/apoAI ratio has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 464 statin or fibrate naïve Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was categorized into 3 groups: intracranial (ICAS, n=236), extracranial (n=44), and no cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis (n=184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoB/apoAI ratio and demographics, including the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, were compared among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ICAS group showed a higher apoB/apoAI ratio (0.81±0.02) than both the extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (0.74±0.03) and no cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis (0.72±0.02) groups (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio was substantially increased (0.93±0.03) in patients with advanced ICAS (≥3 intracranial stenoses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a multivariable analysis, the highest apoB/apoAI ratio quartile was an independent predictor of ICAS (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dose-response relationship was observed between the presence of advanced ICAS and the apoB/apoAI ratio quartiles (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.26 to 12.88 for the second quartile; OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.54 to 15.49 for the third quartile; and OR, 7.79; 95% CI, 2.41 to 25.16 for the fourth quartile when referenced to the first quartile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients having more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> components were more likely to have ICAS, advanced ICAS, and a higher apoB/apoAI ratio (P&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A higher apoB/apoAI ratio is a predictor of ICAS rather than of extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis or no cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apoB/apoAI ratio might be a biomarker for ICAS in Asian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
