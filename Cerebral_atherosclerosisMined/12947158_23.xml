<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracranial and extracranial arteries of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were studied prospectively with transcranial Doppler and duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up regularly for the development of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cardiac event, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 705 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, of whom 345 were documented ultrasonographically as having large-artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was up to 42 months (mean, 28+/-5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventeen patients (17%) died of any cause, and 199 (28%) suffered further cerebrovascular cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3.5-year cumulative mortality rate was 20.8%; for cerebrovascular event, it was 29.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates during the first year were 10.9% for patients without vascular lesion, 17.1% for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> only, and 24.3% for both intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>; for the second year, the rates were 7.5%, 8.6%, and 7.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (log rank, 5.19; P=0.02) or cerebrovascular event (log rank, 9.68; P=0.002) was found among patients with than those without vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with both intracranial and extracranial arterial lesions were at highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (log rank, 9.64; P=0.008) and cerebrovascular event (log rank, 11.56; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and further vascular event were combined as poor outcomes in a Cox proportional-hazards regression model, number of abnormal arteries, advanced age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significant predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, especially coexisting extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, are at higher risk of suffering <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or further vascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide important data for planning future randomized clinical trials for this high-risk group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
