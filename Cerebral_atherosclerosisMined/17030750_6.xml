<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 922 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had both transesophageal echocardiography and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plaques of these patients were classified as either complex aortic plaques (CAP), which protruded &gt; or =4 mm or were present as mobile lesions in the proximal aorta, or simple aortic plaques (SAP), which were &lt;4 mm or present in the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>Cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was classified as either an IC or extracranial (EC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 922 patients, we found aortic plaques in 237 patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 111 (47%) patients of SAP, 74 (31%) patients with CAP, and 52 (22%) patients that had both SAP and CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed IC or EC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 511 patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of aortic plaques was significantly associated with IC or EC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance appeared to be due to the strong association between the presence of SAP and IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (51% SAP vs 35% no plaques; odds ratio = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multiple logistic regression analysis, SAP were independent predictors of IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> CONCLUSIONS: The presence of simple aortic plaques may be a marker of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detection of simple aortic plaques during transesophageal echocardiography may have clinical implications because patients with these plaques frequently had concomitant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
