<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the parameters associated with elevated PDMP levels and examine their relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of main intracranial and extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants included a control group (C) of 61 patients with no apparent cerebral vascular lesions and 110 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, consisting of a small-vessel occlusion group (S) of 34 patients, a large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> group (L) of 41 patients, a cardioembolism group (CE) of 20 patients, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology group (U) of 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet-derived microparticle levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the time of admission, and the patients were reclassified into group CP (control level PDMPs), consisting of 70 patients with control PDMP levels, and group HP (high PDMPs), consisting of 40 patients with elevated PDMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cranial magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) and carotid ultrasound examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Platelet-derived microparticle levels were significantly higher in groups S and L than in group C (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>; odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, P &lt; .05) and concomitant intracranial stenosis (OR = 3.95, P &lt; .01) were significantly correlated with elevated PDMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen and high-sensitivity CRP levels were significantly higher in group HP than in group CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Alterations in PDMP levels correlated with the presence of atherothrombotic lesions, and PDMP levels are expected to be useful as a clinical indicator, reflecting the presence of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
