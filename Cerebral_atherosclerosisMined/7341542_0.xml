<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to age-matched controls, the platelet aggregates ratio (PAR) was reduced from 0.99 +/- 0.04 SD to 0.807 +/- 0.14 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This means a highly significant increase of circulating platelet aggregates (CPA) in untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, regardless of the interval sinche the last attack (from 2 days to 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PAR was especially reduced in patients with abnormal angiography (expressing pronounced cerebral or diffuse ATS) and it was possibly affected by previous antiplatelet treatment with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
