<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined 10,162 patients during the past 5 years using directional continuous-wave Doppler sonography of the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of 1,989 retrograde brachial angiograms, we have developed sonographic criteria for demonstrating a significant increase in the peripheral resistance of both distal vertebral arteries and/or the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 cases of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of at least 60% reduction in lumen diameter (as shown by angiography) exhibited an approximately 40% or higher reduction in the sum of the modified Pourcelot indices of both vertebral arteries in comparison with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3 stenoses below 60% reduction in lumen diameter were not detected by sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even a good collateral circulation through rete-mirabile anastomoses did not normalize the modified Pourcelot indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of persistent primitive trigeminal artery with thin-calibred vertebral arteries was also detected by sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high percentage of patients with one hypoplastic vertebral artery in the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery stenoses</z:e> indicates an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the basilar and/or the distal vertebral artery in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 angiographically verified occlusions of the basilar artery were detected by sonographic criteria independent of the occlusive localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believe that directional continuous-wave Doppler sonography is a reliable technique for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery stenoses</z:e> of at least 60% reduction in lumen diameter and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
