<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the short-term prognosis of patients with recent symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease in the posterior circulation and evaluate differences in the outcome of patients receiving medical or endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 50 consecutive patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease in the posterior circulation were reviewed to record the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the 12-month period following a neurological event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients received medical treatment alone, 13 initially received medical treatment and subsequently were treated with angioplasty/stenting due to recurrent events (analyzed in both groups), and 12 patients received endovascular treatment initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The crossover patients were considered as 1 treated patient in each group; thus, there were 38 subjects (33 men; mean age 68+/-9 years) receiving medical therapy compared with 25 patients (21 men; mean age 63+/-13 years) who underwent endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 12-month period, subjects in the medically-treated group had a higher rate of events (37%, 14/38) than patients who received angioplasty/stenting (12%, 3/25; p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, there were 7 (18%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and 6 (16%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in medically-treated patients versus no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (0%, p = 0.035) and only 2 (8%, p = NS) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the endovascular group, both of which occurred within 48 hours of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and only a single major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> event in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of patients with symptomatic intracranial disease of the posterior territory appears to be associated with a substantially better outcome </plain></SENT>
