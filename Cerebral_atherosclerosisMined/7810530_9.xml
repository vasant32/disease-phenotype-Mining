<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the AABI in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-seven hemodialysis patients were studied, of which the AABI could be measured in 142 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AABI was then compared in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, the AABI was, respectively, 0.87 +/- 0.03 and 1.03 +/- 0.02 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For cerebrovascular disease, the mean AABI for patients with or without disease was, respectively, 0.82 +/- 0.04 and 1.00 +/- 0.02 (P &lt; 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, the mean AABI was, respectively, 0.75 +/- 0.04 and 1.02 +/- 0.02 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean AABI was 0.86 +/- 0.03 in patients with any of the three diseases compared with 1.07 +/- 0.02 in patients without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of patients had an AABI of less than 0.9; 24% were less than 0.8 and 11% were less than 0.7.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
