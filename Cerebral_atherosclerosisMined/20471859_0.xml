<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a feared complication after open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients undergo testing of the carotid arteries before surgery, but intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not commonly assessed as a mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively maintained database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> open heart surgeries at our institution from 2005 to 2007 for patients who developed a periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were assessed for the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through radiographic imaging of the intracranial circulation to determine the frequency of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as a mechanism for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10,367 patients underwent open heart surgery from 2005 to 2007 and 180 (1.74%) patients were noted to have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 180 patients, 98 (55%) underwent intracranial imaging and 29 (30%) were noted to have narrowing of an intracranial vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (17.4%) patients were found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ipsilateral to the stenosis, but 8 (8.1%) of these patients were also noted to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, 9 (9.1%) patients were thought to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> solely related to the intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may be an underreported mechanism for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to better understand the prevalence of the disease in this population and subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
