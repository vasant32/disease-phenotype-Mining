<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: One concern with respect to stent procedures performed to treat patients with intracranial lesions is the fate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> major arterial branches after stents are placed across them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because most of these lesions occur at vessel bifurcations or at branch points, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> major branch often arises near the lesion and may be difficult to avoid during stent positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to describe the angiographic outcome of intracranial major branch arteries crossed by a stent in the intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the immediate postprocedural cerebral angiograms of the 40 patients who underwent intracranial stenting at the University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, between June 1998 and April 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each of 10 patients, the stent was placed across a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> major branch artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stents were used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in seven patients and intracranial stenosis in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latest cerebral angiogram available was reviewed, and the patency of the major branch arteries was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The angiographic follow-up period ranged from 4 days to 35 months (mean follow-up, 10 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of the 10 major branch arteries was patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with the territory of the major branch arteries crossed by the stents, and no patient experienced a related episode of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients died as a result of causes unrelated to the stenting procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The histology of a middle cerebral artery stent that was placed across a lenticulostriate perforator is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The flexible, low-profile stents used in this study had no angiographically or clinically apparent effect on the major intracranial branches across which they were placed </plain></SENT>
