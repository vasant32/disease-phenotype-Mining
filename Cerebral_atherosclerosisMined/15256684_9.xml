<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies reporting high numbers of Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA positives in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients published to date have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques highly prone to generate false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of C. pneumoniae DNA in plaques of the carotid artery as well as in peripheral blood by means of a new, closed, real-time PCR system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy specimens and preoperative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 75 individuals with severe cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were analyzed by means of a C. pneumoniae-specific quantitative ompA-based real-time PCR TaqMan system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques were also cultured onto HEp-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before the surgical intervention, C. pneumoniae-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 89% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied had C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies, but the pathogen was not detected in a single carotid atheroma by real-time PCR and cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, C. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 4 PBMC samples (5.3%) at very low levels (&lt;1 inclusion/6 mL EDTA blood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical significance was found between symptomatic/asymptomatic patients, C. pneumoniae PCR, results and CRP values after correction for multiplicity-of-test adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By means of a closed, highly sensitive, and specific real-time PCR, C. pneumoniae was not detected in cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCR on PBMC was not predictive for endovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chlamydia infection</z:e> and most likely stem from previous C. pneumoniae <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> in individual cases </plain></SENT>
