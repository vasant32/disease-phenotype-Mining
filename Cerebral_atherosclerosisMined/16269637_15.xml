<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patterns and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify lesion patterns and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease using early diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 185 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who had (1) symptomatic lesions located in the unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on DWI performed within 48 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and (2) either corresponding <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, or cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> DWI lesion patterns were classified as (1) single (small perforator &lt;2 cm; large perforator &gt; or =2 cm; pial; large territorial; border-zone) and (2) multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease was diagnosed in 63 patients, 32 (50.8%) of whom showed multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant perforator and pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (14/63, P&lt;0.001), concomitant perforator, pial, and border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (9/63, P&lt;0.001), and single small perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (12/63, P=0.001) were identified more often in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease than in those with cardioembolism or internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in patients with milder stenosis than with severe stenosis or occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether they occurred singly or in addition to other lesions, pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified more often in patients with severe stenosis or occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perforating artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whether single or occurring in addition to pial or border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, are lesion patterns specific for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that local branch occlusion and coexisting distal embolization may be a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
