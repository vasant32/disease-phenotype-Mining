<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) graft constructed by the surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many patients were over 70 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications for surgery were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the perioperative period, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The patients were asymptomatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
