<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that mainly manifested as recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and to explore the pathogenesis of these incidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that manifested mainly as recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their risk factors, clinical characteristics, cranial MRIs, angiograms and perfusion images were recorded in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for at least 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Every patient had at least one risk factor for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations in most of the patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>-like incidents, but the duration was longer, lasting for minutes to hours, but mostly less than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients could be sorted into three types according to the angiographic data: type A severe stenosis in anterior circulation (mostly on both sides); type B severe stenosis in posterior circulation; and type C multiple severe stenosis (in both anterior and posterior circulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was severely reduced in the stenotic arteries as shown by angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perfusion studies in type A patients also showed diffuse hypoperfusion of cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, the patient lost his consciousness when the Angioguard (a protective guidewire) passed through the stenosis, and he regained consciousness when the stent was fully-opened in a few minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 12 patients received medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients who were ineffective with medical treatment along received stent angioplasty and there was no incident during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of the remaining eight patients with medical treatment alone had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> within 90 days, including two with disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> is a rare manifestation of large cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The probable mechanism may be diffuse hypoperfusion in cerebrum or brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These patients are in high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Interventional therapy to revascularize the cerebral circulation may be a rational treatment </plain></SENT>
