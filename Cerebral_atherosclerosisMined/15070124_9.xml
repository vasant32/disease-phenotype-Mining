<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Use of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-eluting stent has led to a reduction of in-stent stenosis following treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, whereas treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with bare-metal stents results in excessive restenosis rates of approximately 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity effects and vessel injury are unknown in the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the safety profile and vascular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents, the authors conducted a prospective comparative study in which drug-eluting and bare-metal stents were implanted in the canine basilar artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen mongrel dogs were randomized (eight animals per group) to receive either bare-metal 1.5 x 8-mm (six-cell) stents or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-eluting stents of the same dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventionists, histopathologists, and histopathology technicians who participated in the study were blinded to the stent characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stents were implanted in the canine BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial peripheral blood samples were obtained during the 1st week after implantation to determine the time-dependent serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiographic studies were performed 30 days after stent implantation to assess the effects of stent placement on the BA and brainstem perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Explantation of the stent and BA was performed immediately after angiography by using a pressurized formalin fixation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological and computer-assisted morphometric analyses of specimens obtained in each animal were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Sirolimus</z:chebi> could not be detected in peripheral blood samples obtained later than 24 hours posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On follow-up angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> perforating vessels observed on initial angiograms remained patent, and no evidence of parent vessel damage or pseudoaneurysm formation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Explanted vessels and brainstem sections did not demonstrate evidence of histological neurotoxicity, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the time to endothelialization of bare-metal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Smooth-muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, the putative agent for restenosis, was lower in animals receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intimal fibrin density was increased in the dogs treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Histological evidence of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> demonstrated a trend toward a reduced response in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> group (mean 0.58) compared with the bare-metal group (mean 0.83, p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No neurotoxic effects were observed in the intracranial vessel walls or brainstem tissue in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Compared with bare-metal stents, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated devices did not impair endothelialization and, furthermore, tended to reduce the proliferation of SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated devices may inhibit in-stent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further studies with longer-term follow up are required to assess the restenosis rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-coated stents implanted in the intracranial vasculature </plain></SENT>
