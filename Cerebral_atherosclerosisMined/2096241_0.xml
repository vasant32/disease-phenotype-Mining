<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the influence of indeloxazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (IH) upon photic driving responses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDRs</z:e>) elicited by a 5 Hz flickering dot pattern and red flicker stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made from a total of 22 elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By oral IH administration, clinical improvement was found in 12 patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (improved group), whereas it was not observed in 6 patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, 2 patients with multiinfarct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (unimproved group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after the IH administration, an EEG examination by the above visual stimuli was carried out in each patient; a power spectral analysis of the occipital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDRs</z:e> elicited by the visual stimuli was then made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The powers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDRs</z:e> elicited by the flickering dot pattern stimulation were not significantly different in both groups; those of 10 and 15 Hz <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDRs</z:e> elicited by the red flicker stimulation, however, decreased significantly by the IH administration in the improved group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that such an analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDRs</z:e> elicited by the red flicker stimulation might perhaps be useful as one of the indicators to evaluate the efficacy of IH </plain></SENT>
