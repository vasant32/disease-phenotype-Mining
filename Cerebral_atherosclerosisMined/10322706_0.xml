<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the average level of Lp(a) in cases was (238.38 mg/L), significantly higher than that of controls (149.98 mg/L t = 3.96, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing the levels of different age groups and sex, no significant difference, except the group over 70 years, which was higher than that in other groups was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-response analysis also showed that the OR value was positively correlated with the Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-variable logistic regression model indicated that Lp(a) was an independent risk factor with OR = 1.93 </plain></SENT>
