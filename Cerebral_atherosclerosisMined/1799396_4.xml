<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> is correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but no definite information is available on its association with cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 10 young patients (age 3-32 years) with homozygous familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (FH), together with 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extra- and intracranial Doppler examination, MRI and cerebral blood flow by SPECT and 99mTc-HM-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six out of 10 patients already had signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were free from ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, as small as detectable at MRI, and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented significant stenosis of the carotid arteries at Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young patients with homozygous FH have early and clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, while overt disease in the cerebral district is delayed despite the extremely elevated plasma cholesterol concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was also confirmed by the autopsy of two patients, who died after the study and whose cerebral arteries were totally free from <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age, at which flow-reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> develop in hypercholesterolemic patients, differs with regard to the arterial district involved </plain></SENT>
