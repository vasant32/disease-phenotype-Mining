<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Procedural safety and high rates of in-stent recurrent stenotic lesions (ISR) remain a concern in the endovascular treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study technical feasibility, safety and efficacy of the paclitaxel eluting balloon-expandable coronary stent Coroflex(®) Please was assessed in the treatment of ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 95 patients (79 male; median age 68 years) with 106 intracranial atherosclerotic stenotic lesions underwent endovascular treatment using Coroflex(®) Please stents (B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Braun, Melsungen, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Location and degree of target stenoses before and after treatment and at follow-up and adverse clinical sequelae of treatment were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural medication included 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and 75 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was scheduled for 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lesion locations were as follows: internal carotid artery (ICA) petrous (n = 44, 42%), ICA cavernous (n = 43, 41%), ICA paraclinoid (n = 4, 4%), intradural vertebral artery (VA; n = 11, 10%) and basilar artery (BA; n = 4, 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the lesions seven could not be treated due to difficult <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and stent stiffness (7% technical failure rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined post-interventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality rate, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (CCF) was n = 4 (3.7%) within and n = 1 (0.9%) at and beyond 30 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic and clinical follow-up examinations were carried out for 78 (78%) of the lesions (mean 16.1 months, maximum 48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic recurrent stenosis was seen in 3 out of 78 (3.8%) lesions and there was 1 case of late stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ICAD using drug-eluting coronary stents is safe and effective but technical failure due to stent stiffness remains a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Application of the more flexible, newest generation thin-strut stents, however, shows promising results </plain></SENT>
