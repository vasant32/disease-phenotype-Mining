<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess, in vivo, the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the common carotid arteries and in the aorta of patients undergoing hemodialysis and their relation to clinical variables and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ultrasonic system was employed to measure intimal-medial thickness in the carotid arteries and compliance in the aortic iliac axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive significant relation emerged between carotid intimal-medial thickness and the length of time on dialysis (p &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore there was a significant correlation between intimal-medial thickness and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (p &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between aortic-iliac compliance and the clinical variables considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive examination of the peripheral arteries with ultrasound could be a useful technique in the follow-up of patients on dialytic treatment; it could aid in the identification of the patients who are at increased vascular risk </plain></SENT>
