<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left-sided vascular hemispheric brain-distrubances, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, reduce, compared with arteriosclerotics, without focal signs, verbal, action-and total IQ, those on the right side only the action and total IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When comparing right- and left-sided frontal, frontoparietal and frontotemporal vascular disturbances - with or without a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>-, the left-sided frontotemporal lesions had a lower action- and verbal IQ, even if there were no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In children aged between 12 and 40 months we found no correlation between the degree of motor dominance and mental development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000750'>delayed speech development</z:hpo>--and therefore also in children with subnormal development--the number of lefthander was significantly higher than with the other children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One can show electromyographically that, when a muscle is voluntarily contracted, there is simultaneous contraction of the same muscle on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This contralateral motorspread happens more often from the stimulation of the dominant side to the subordinated side than vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral somato-sensory cortical response is more common when stimulating the dominant than the subordinated ulnar nerve and develops ontogenetically parellel with right- or left-handedness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stabilographic registration can show a right-sided prevalence of swing of the vertical axis of the body, which probably is related to a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> of the vestibular apparatus on galvanic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With the eyes open, the right-sided deviation of the bodyaxis increases which can be explained by greater functional strength of the right visuomoto system, which itself can be shown by the higher frequency of right-sided optocinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
