<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 165 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (CRF) aged 46 +/- 15 years, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) - 37.2 (35.02-40.83) and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examination included ultrasound dopplerography of the common carotid arteries (CCA) and common femoral arteries (CFA) for detection of atherosclerotic plaques (AP), estimation of the thickness of arterial intima-media, elasticity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was detected in 60 patients, that of cardiac vessels, brain, kidneys and lower limbs - in 35, 30, 23 and 8 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> cardiovascular complications occurred in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors were age, body mass index, systolic and pulse arterial pressure, disturbances of <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>-calcium metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structure and function of CCA and CFA were studied with dopplerography in 37 CRF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased intima-media thickness was associated with age, male sex, overweight, hypercholesterinemia, systolic and pulse arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body mass index, GFR, creatinin level were independent factors of intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal elasticity of CCA was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, CFA - to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
