<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A thorough understanding of the relationship between local hemodynamics and plaque progression has been hindered by an inability to prospectively monitor these factors in vivo in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study a novel approach for noninvasively reconstructing artery wall thickness and local hemodynamics at the human carotid bifurcation is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) models of the lumen and wall boundaries, from which wall thickness can be measured, were reconstructed from black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Along with time-varying inlet/outlet flow rates measured via phase contrast (PC) MRI, the lumen boundary was used as input for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of the subject-specific flow patterns and wall shear stresses (WSSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from a 59-year-old subject with early, asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> show good agreement between simulated and measured velocities, and demonstrate a correspondence between wall thickening and low and oscillating shear at the carotid bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High shear at the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) was also colocalized with higher WSS; however, a quantitative general relationship between WSS and wall thickness was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained from a 23-year-old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings represent the first direct comparison of hemodynamic variables and wall thickness at the carotid bifurcation of human subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The noninvasive nature of this image-based modeling approach makes it ideal for carrying out future prospective studies of hemodynamics and plaque development or progression in otherwise healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
