<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2009 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total 132 stents were implanted in the 111 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality and rate of neural and non-neural complications were assessed perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes [including the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>) were assessed after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIHSS rating was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases before and at first week, 6th month and 12th month after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PTAS success rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis was reduced after PTAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total complication rate during perioperative period was 15.3% (the rate of neural complications was 3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.48%) developed cerebrovascular events within 1 month, containing one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, one case of ipsilateral mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one case of contralateral mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores were obviously decreased during a follow-up period as compared with those pre-operation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that PTAS could significantly alleviate the neural function deficit of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia cerebrovascular</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The success rate of PTAS was high, and the rate of complications was lower and the clinical outcomes were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>PTAS is a safe and effective therapeutic method, though the long-term outcomes need further study </plain></SENT>
