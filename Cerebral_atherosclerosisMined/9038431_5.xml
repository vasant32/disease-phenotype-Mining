<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (15 women, 20 men) with a history of cerebrovascular disease were examined using conventional color-coded Doppler ultrasound and 3D ultrasound angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was initially diagnosed using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities, 21 patients were evaluated using 3D ultrasound on three occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of patients were diagnosed with stenosis of more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two percent of plaques had a smooth surface, 72.9% were ulcerated, and 5.1% were indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data collection for 3D imaging required 5 minutes per patient, whereas image processing and plaque volume quantification required 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaque volume ranged from 0.053 to 0.685 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were 4.16 and 5.87%, respectively (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.0001; r = 0.89, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3D Color Doppler and 3D ultrasound angiography assessments of plaque volume differed by 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plaques were more precisely differentiated using 3D ultrasound, and plaque volume quantification was less affected by echo shadowing after 3D reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other techniques for the quantification of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3D ultrasound angiography offers a more precise quantitative method for prospective, clinical studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
