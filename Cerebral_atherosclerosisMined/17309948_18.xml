<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have demonstrated enhanced activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in human plaques and evidenced that it is associated with inflammatory-induced plaque rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the inflammatory infiltration and ubiquitin-proteasome activity in asymptomatic carotid plaques of hypertensive patients with different patterns of morning blood pressure surge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques were obtained from 32 hypertensive patients without morning blood pressure surge and 28 with morning blood pressure surge enlisted to undergo carotid endarterectomy for extracranial high-grade (&gt;70%) internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaques were analyzed for macrophages, T-lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen-DR+cells, ubiquitin-proteasome activity, nuclear factor-kappaB, inhibitor kB-beta, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, nitrotyrosine, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and collagen content (immunohistochemistry and ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with plaques obtained from hypertensive patients without morning blood pressure surge, plaques from with morning blood pressure surge had more macrophages, T-lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen-DR+cells (P&lt;0.001), ubiquitin-proteasome activity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kB (P&lt;0.001), nitrotyrosine, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (P&lt;0.01), along with a lesser collagen content and IkB-beta levels (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced ubiquitin-proteasome activity in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of patients with morning blood pressure surge is associated with inflammatory-dependent unstable plaque phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a potential interplay between morning blood pressure surge and ubiquitin-proteasome activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
