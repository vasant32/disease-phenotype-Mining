<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current report details our initial periprocedural experience with Wingspan (Boston Scientific/Target), the first self-expanding stent system designed for the treatment of intracranial atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting with the Gateway balloon-Wingspan stent system were prospectively tracked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 9-month period, treatment with the stent system was attempted in 78 patients (average age, 63.6 years; 33 women) with 82 intracranial atheromatous lesions, of which 54 were &gt; or =70% stenotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one of 82 lesions were successfully stented (98.8%) during the first treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1 case, the stent could not be delivered across the lesion; the patient was treated solely with angioplasty and stented at a later date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions treated involved the internal carotid (n=32; 8 petrous, 10 cavernous, 11 supraclinoid segment, 3 terminus), vertebral (n=14; V4 segment), basilar (n=14), and middle cerebral (n=22) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean+/-SD pretreatment stenosis was 74.6+/-13.9%, improving to 43.5+/-18.1% after balloon angioplasty and to 27.2+/-16.7% after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 82 lesions treated, there were 5 (6.1%) major periprocedural neurological complications, 4 of which ultimately led to patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic intracranial atheromatous disease can be performed with the Gateway balloon-Wingspan stent system with a high rate of technical success and acceptable periprocedural morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our initial experience indicates that this procedure represents a viable treatment option for this patient population </plain></SENT>
