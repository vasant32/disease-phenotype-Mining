<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients and AD animal models demonstrate the accumulation of inflammatory microglia at sites of insoluble fibrillar beta-amyloid protein (fAbeta) deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that fAbeta binds to CD36, a type B scavenger receptor also involved in internalization of oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), and initiate a signaling cascade that regulates microglial recruitment, activation, and secretion of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> leading to neuronal dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent demonstration of a binding site for the growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) on CD36 prompted us to ascertain whether ghrelin and synthetic GHS could modulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines in fAbeta-activated microglia cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that N9 microglia cells express the CD36 and are a suitable model to study the activation of inflammatory cytokines synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, in N9 cells exposed to fAbeta(25-35) for 24 hr, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 mRNA significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 10(-7) M desacyl-ghrelin, hexarelin, and EP80317 in the nanomolar range effectively counteracted fAbeta(25-35) stimulation of IL-6 mRNA levels, whereas ghrelin was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the effects of fAbeta(25-35) on IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were attenuated by desacyl-ghrelin, hexarelin, and EP80317, but not ghrelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because we have observed that the specific GHS receptor GHS-R1a is not expressed in N9 cells, the actions of GHS should be mediated by different receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reportedly, hexarelin and EP80317 are capable of binding the CD36 in mouse macrophages and reducing atherosclerotic plaque deposition in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that desacyl-ghrelin, hexarelin, and EP80317 might interfere with fAbeta activation of CD36 in microglia cells </plain></SENT>
