<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these results a prospective randomized trial was initiated, comparing the effect of antiplatelet drugs (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>] 1000 mg/day) versus untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both investigations patient survival was the primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cardiac risk (n = 91) implied a significant reduction in patient survival (p less than 0.019 Breslow, p less than 0.052 Mantel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiaggregating drugs prolonged survival in the collective series (p less than 0.0001 Breslow, p less than 0.0002 Mantel) and in the subgroup of patients with cardiac risk (p less than 0.014 Breslow, p less than 0.020 Mantel) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the prospective trial 66 patients were recruited, receiving <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (n = 32) versus no therapy (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up 15 patients died, 4 in the treatment, and 11 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between both groups there was a significant difference in the probability of survival (p less than 0.021 Breslow, p less than 0.048 Mantel) </plain></SENT>
