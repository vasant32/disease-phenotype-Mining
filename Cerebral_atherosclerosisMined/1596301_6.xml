<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with an elevation of serum elastase-like activity by more than 30% in the first week, there was a significantly higher elevation of serum GOT and LDH1 and a greater occurrence of transmural (Q) infarction than in those with a smaller variation of elastase-like activity </plain></SENT>
