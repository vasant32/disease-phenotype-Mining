<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using functional transcranial Doppler sonography and a hypercapnic challenge as a marker of intact cerebral vasoreactivity, we determined CBF velocity (CBFV) changes in response to a language and arithmetic task in a group of 43 healthy young subjects (mean age 32 +/- 8.6 years), 18 healthy old subjects (mean age 64 +/- 9.8 years) and 29 old subjects with risk factors for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (mean age 69 +/- 8.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar performance during the cognitive tasks the CBFV changes were significantly lower in the group of old subjects with vascular risk factors compared with the healthy young and old subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the CBFV changes during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> were significantly lower in the group of old subjects with vascular risk factors compared with the healthy young and old subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both cognitive tasks and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> produced comparable CBFV changes in the group of healthy young and old subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the hemodynamic response to neuronal activation is unaffected by aging alone, whereas the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> significantly diminishes the capability of cerebral vessels to react to vasodilating stimuli </plain></SENT>
