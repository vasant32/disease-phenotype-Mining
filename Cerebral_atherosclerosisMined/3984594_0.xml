<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with a crisis-like increase in the blood pressure, the drug induced a rapid and considerable drop in the blood pressure, a decrease of the tone and an elevation of the blood content of the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with a moderately elevated stable BP, this effect was less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase in the cerebral blood content was mostly seen in the zones of the arteries of the predominantly muscle type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was effected by both the vasodilating action of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and the autoregulatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
