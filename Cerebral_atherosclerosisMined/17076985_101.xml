<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The ARBITER 2 trial showed that extended-release niacin (ERN) when added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy slowed the progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether longer treatment with ERN would have a greater effect on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the long-term effects of ERN on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) cholesterol and CIMT during 12-24 months treatment with ERN in ARBITER 2 participants who were either continued or were crossed over (from placebo) to ERN 1000 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Among 149 subjects completing ARBITER 2, 130 (88%) enrolled in ARBITER 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prespecified primary endpoints were the within-group change in CIMT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> in patients receiving placebo for 12 months (n = 71), ERN for 12 months (comprised of subjects from ERN treatment during ARBITER 2 (n = 78) and those crossed over to ERN from placebo after ARBITER 2 (n = 47)), and ERN for 24 months spanning ARBITER 2 and 3 (n = 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five subjects discontinued the study due to flushing side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study was completed by 104 subjects (47 crossed over from placebo; 57 with ERN continued from ARBITER 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> increased in the ERN group from 39.5 +/- 6.7 to 48.6 +/- 13.3 mg/dl (p &lt; 0.001) along with modest reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 125 participants treated with ERN for 12 months, there was a net regression of CIMT of -0.027 +/- 0.011 mm (p &lt; 0.001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 57 participants treated with ERN for 24 months, there was additional significant regression of CIMT of -0.041 +/- 0.021 mm (p = 0.001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Controlling for changes in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, only changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> were independently associated with regression of CIMT (beta = -0.25; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, ERN significantly increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> regression measured by CIMT over 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Limitations to this study include its open-label design and the inability to relate CIMT effects to clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
