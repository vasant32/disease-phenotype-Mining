<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to document the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and associated cardiac complications among patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005299'>premature peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the peripheral and coronary arterial circulations of 59 consecutive male military veterans diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005299'>premature peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> &lt; or = 45 years) affecting the lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who had not previously undergone coronary angiography underwent exercise stress testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients unable to perform exercise testing and those with abnormal exercise test results underwent coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no evidence of CAD in 16 patients (29%) on the basis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> exercise test results (n = 12) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary angiography results (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients (71%) had significant (&gt; or = 50% lesion) CAD by coronary catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac complications were frequent among the 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (65%) of the 17 patients with single-vessel CAD had previously documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, as did three (75%) of the four patients with two-vessel CAD and 18 (82%) of the 22 patients with three vessel or greater CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three (18%) patients with one-vessel CAD had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for symptoms, as had one patient (25%) with two-vessel CAD and 19 patients (86%) with three-vessel or greater CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients died during the study period, four of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Premature peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is associated with a high prevalence of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of CAD is important in this group, because cardiac complications are frequent </plain></SENT>
