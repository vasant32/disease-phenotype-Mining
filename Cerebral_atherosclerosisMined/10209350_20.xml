<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between March 1996 and December 1997, 15 consecutive patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> diagnosed with duplex sonography were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), following a protocol similar to that of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of ultrasound findings, six of the 15 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), and the remaining nine had atherothrombotic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No relevant haemorrhagic complications were observed after rt-PA treatment of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excellent late functional outcome was observed in three of the 15 patients with ICA occlusion, moderate and poor outcome in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients died, and mortality was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity upon admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A good outcome seemed to be more likely in the small group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, than in the patients suffering atherothrombotic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the results of rt-PA treatment in this case series are by no means devastating, our data do not corroborate the hypothesis that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> following ICA occlusion should a priori be excluded from intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible benefit of rt-PA treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICA occlusion should be assessed in a larger prospective trial, for which this case series might serve as a pilot study </plain></SENT>
