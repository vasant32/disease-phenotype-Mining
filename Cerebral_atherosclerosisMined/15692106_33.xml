<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate whether hypoadiponectinemia is present in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this case-control study, plasma adiponectin concentration was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects with or without ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 534 subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma level of adiponectin of the 228 patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was significantly lower than that of 306 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was stratified according to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status, plasma levels of adiponectin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly lower than those of their counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreasing concentrations of adiponectin were independently and significantly associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> when concentrations were analyzed by quartile and as a continuous variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were subgrouped according to the comorbidity with or without type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the same trend of association between plasma adiponectin and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was observed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that there are significantly lower levels of plasma adiponectin in patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
