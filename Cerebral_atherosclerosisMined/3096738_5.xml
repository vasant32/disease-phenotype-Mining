<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The best discriminators by univariate analysis were serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-AI, followed by <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-AII, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-AI only, patients and controls could be classified with 88-91% certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By combination of some of the variables which were selected by a stepwise discriminant analysis, several models were calculated resulting in 93-97% segregation of patients from controls </plain></SENT>
