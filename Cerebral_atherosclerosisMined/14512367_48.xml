<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We conducted a quantitative investigation of brain arterial atherosclerotic damage and its relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-four consecutive autopsy cases, 32 AD and 22 nondemented control subjects, were examined to establish the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessel external and lumenal area measurements were taken from 3-mm arterial cross-sections to calculate a stenosis index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AD patient circle of Willis arteries possessed a significant degree of stenosis as a consequence of multiple and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These lesions were significantly more severe in AD cases than in age-matched controls (P&lt;0.0001), and the number of stenoses and the index of occlusion (R=0.67; P&lt;0.00001) were positively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the index of stenosis significantly correlated with the following measures of AD neuropathological lesions: total plaque score, neuritic plaque score, neurofibrillary tangle score, Braak stage score, and white matter rarefaction score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals an association between severe circle of Willis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AD that should be considered a risk factor for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations strongly suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-induced brain hypoperfusion contributes to the clinical and pathological manifestations of AD </plain></SENT>
