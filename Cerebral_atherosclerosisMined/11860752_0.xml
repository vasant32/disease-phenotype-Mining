<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used in a sample of 199 cases with documented ACI and 204 healthy matched by age and sex individuals selected from Chinese Han nationality in Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The studied loci include promoter region (-75 bp) and the intron - 1 (+83 bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Both ACI and control groups M1 + + and M1 + - were major frequent genotypes in Beijng area, M2 + + were major frequent genotypes in intron - 1; (2) M1 + - genotype appeared more common among patients than in controls (0.487 vs 0.368, P &lt; 0.05, OR = 1.64); (3) Individuals with M1 + -/M2 + + haplotype were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (0.437 vs 0.314, P &lt; 0.05, OR = 1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that both M1 + - genotype and M1 + -/M2 + + haplotype of ApoAI gene might associate with ACI in our study </plain></SENT>
