<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the thixotropic parameters of blood from 92 patients suffering from cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I consisted of 14 male patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (CA) (aged 61.7 +/- 8.2 years) and Group II, 12 male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient cerebral ischemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) (64.4 +/- 7.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of patients in groups III (22 male old patients, 66.6 +/- 5.1 years), IV (24 male middle-aged patients 53.7 +/- 2.8 years), and V (20 female patients 58.4 +/- 13.8 years) were suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 92 patients and 92 selected healthy subjects were pair matched in sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using paired t-test, we compared their thixotropic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the yield stress (tau 0), the equilibrium value of the structural parameter (A), the apparent viscosity at 2.37 s-1 (eta s), and non-Newtonian contribution of viscosity (eta s-mu) in groups I, II and III were significantly higher than those in the corresponding control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The values of tau 0, A, eta s, (eta s-mu) and eta p of blood in group V were higher than those in the control group; only the values of tau 0, eta p, (eta s-mu) of blood in group IV were higher than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the thixotropic parameters was noted among groups I, II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the patients with cerebrovascular diseases had evidently increased number and degree of RBC aggregation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
