<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA polymorphisms in genes encoding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> (apo) A-I, C-III, B and E and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have been proposed to be associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the same genetic markers would also be associated with the occurrence and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 234 survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> aged 60 years or less were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed using aortic arch angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SstI polymorphism of apoA-I/C-III gene locus, the XbaI polymorphism of apoB gene, common apoE phenotypes and the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of the apoA-I/C-III, apoB, apoE or ACE gene did not differ between the groups with (n = 148) or without (n = 85) cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when patients with at least one apoE4 allele and one X2 allele of apoB were combined and compared with those without either of them (E2E3 or E3E3 and X1X1), a significant association with the presence of cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was found (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients having the E2E3 phenotype had a significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001552'>elevated serum triglyceride level</z:mp> compared with those with the E3E3 phenotype (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol was lower in the patients with the E2E3 phenotype than in those with the E3E3 and E3E4 (P = 0.01 and P = 0.06, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apoB or ACE genotypes were not significantly associated with serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the ACE gene polymorphism and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the interaction of common apoB and apoE alleles may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
