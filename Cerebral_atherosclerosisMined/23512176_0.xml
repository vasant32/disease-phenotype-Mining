<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the 1-year clinical and angiographic outcome of angioplasty and stenting of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> using Wingspan and Gateway system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with symptomatic lesions were treated and followed clinically and angiographically by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two primary endpoints were recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and in-stent restenosis (ISR) at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential factors correlated with ISR were studied using univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment was attempted in 65 patients and successfully completed in 61 (93.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients (44 men, 15 women) aged 62.86±11.38 years with 66 stenoses (average degree of stenosis 71.78±11.23%) underwent clinical and DSA follow-up at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 66 stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ISR occurred in 11 of the 66 lesions (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> gain occurred in 32 of the lesions (48.5%), an unchanged lumen in 4 (6%) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss in 30 (45.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 6.1% (4/65), including three hemorrhagic and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which occurred at the corresponding site and resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no interval <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> between the periprocedural time and the 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of ISR was correlated with the degree of stenosis before treatment and was not correlated with patient age or sex, vessel diameter, location of stenosis or failure to control risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-year clinical and angiographic outcomes of angioplasty and stenting are promising for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
