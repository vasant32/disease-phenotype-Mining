<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the role of hs-CRP in asymptomatic intracranial artery occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 3,366 apparently healthy subjects who received a brain checkup, 138 with &gt; or =25% intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on magnetic resonance angiography, 267 with &gt; or =25% extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on B-mode ultrasonography and 435 without intracranial artery or extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (age-matched controls) were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CRP concentration in the subjects with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was not significantly different from that in the control subjects, and the differences of mean CRP concentrations among the subgroups with 25-49, 50-74 and 75% or greater stenosis in the intracranial artery were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of hs-CRP for extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> tended to increase with increasing CRP concentrations, but those of hs-CRP for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The degree of atherogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in asymptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may be less than that in extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
