<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preprocedure combined antiplatelet administration of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and its duration is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preferably, this should be administered 5-7 days prior to the intended procedure and 90 days after the stent placement is preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation during the procedure is implemented routinely in the neurointerventional labs during intracranial intervention, with a goal of activated clotting time between 250 to 300 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preferred agent is unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> as an intravenous bolus of 70-80 units/kg, without postprocedure reversal in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control of blood pressure intraprocedure and in the neurointensive care unit to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and hyperperfusion injury is of paramount significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The preferred blood pressure is not well known, but lowering the blood pressure below the baseline after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> gain with stenting would be recommended to prevent secondary injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of general anesthesia versus local and monitored awake anesthesia is controversial and there are no data to support one method over another in cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> interventional and endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the patient is cooperative and would be able to tolerate the procedure under awake anesthesia, the latter would provide an immediate assessment of the neurological outcome and feedback from the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, general anesthesia would provide the interventionalist with less movement artifact and less road mapping need and immediate and accurate assessment of the location of the microwire, catheter, and stent </plain></SENT>
