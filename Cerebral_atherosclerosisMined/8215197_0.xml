<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Either they are not recognised or diagnosed adequately or there may be a true decreased geographical/racial incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To have an idea of the true incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, a study of Circle of Willis with its anatomical variations and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was carried out in 1021 consecutive autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of anatomical variations was slightly less than that seen in most of the other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was seen in 9.2% of the Circles of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were only two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, both located at the bifurcation of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This incidence of 0.2% is definitely much lower than that seen in other series, thus, suggesting that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> from aneurysmal rupture is likely to be genuinely less in India </plain></SENT>
