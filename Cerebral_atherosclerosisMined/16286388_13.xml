<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, which shows focal lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leukoaraiosis, plays a central role in the diagnosis and evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging abnormalities in a large prospectively recruited cohort of CADASIL patients to describe the spatial distribution of abnormalities, determine how this distribution alters with age, and identify any correlations with the clinical features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 112 CADASIL subjects from 64 families were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging scans were graded by a single neuroradiologist, by using the modified Scheltens scale, to quantify the severity of high-signal-intensity changes in different brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion load increased progressively with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scores were maximal in the frontal, parietal, and anterior temporal cortex, and the external capsule; intermediate in the pons; and relatively low in the corpus callosum, caudate, globus pallidus, cerebellum, midbrain, and medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior temporal pole involvement was common at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages and, when present, usually confluent, but this was absent in 33% of patients 20-29 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correlated with total Scheltens score and internal capsule and pontine scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> correlated with total Scheltens score and subcortical white matter score, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> correlated with subcortical white matter score but not total Scheltens score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a characteristic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging abnormalities in CADASIL that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in differential diagnosis; however, some characteristic features, such as anterior temporal pole involvement, can be absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging lesion load correlated with some clinical features including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is more common in individuals with deep white matter changes </plain></SENT>
