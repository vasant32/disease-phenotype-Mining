<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In-stent restenosis (ISR) occurs in approximately one-third of patients after the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> with the Wingspan system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review our experience with target lesion revascularization (TLR) for ISR after Wingspan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from 5 participating institutions in our US Wingspan Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ISR was defined as &gt;50% stenosis within or immediately adjacent (within 5 mm) to the implanted stent and &gt;20% absolute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To date, 36 patients in the registry have experienced ISR after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with Wingspan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 29 (80.6%) have undergone TLR with either angioplasty alone (n=26) or angioplasty with restenting (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restenting was performed for in-stent dissections that occurred after the initial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 patients undergoing TLR, 9 required &gt;/=1 interventions for recurrent ISR, for a total of 42 interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One major complication, a postprocedural reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, was encountered in the periprocedural period (2.4% per procedure; 3.5% per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up is available for 22 of 29 patients after TLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 22 (50%) demonstrated recurrent ISR at follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients have undergone multiple retreatments (2 retreatments, n=6; 3 retreatments, n=2; 4 retreatments, n=1) for recurrent ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine of 11 recurrent ISR lesions were located within the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean age for patients with recurrent anterior circulation ISR was 57.9 years (vs 81 years for posterior circulation ISR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TLR can be performed for the treatment of intracranial Wingspan ISR with a relatively high degree of safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the TLR results are not durable in approximately 50% of patients, and multiple revascularization procedures may be required in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
