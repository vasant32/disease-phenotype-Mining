<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown increased platelet activation in patients with coronary artery, cerebrovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the temporal relationship between platelet activation and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To answer this basic question, we measured the plasma concentrations of two specific platelet activation markers, beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) and platelet factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) in 459 cases with increased carotid arterial wall thickness and 459 age-, sex-and race-matched controls selected from a cohort of 15,800 men and women, aged 45-64 who participated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These participants had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular symptoms or known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean values of beta TG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> were significantly higher in cases than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when analyzed by quartiles using conditional logistic regression, only beta TG exhibited a significant association with carotid wall thickness, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis was significantly higher for the uppermost quartile of beta TG (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5) compared to the lower 3 quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This OR was 2.3 in white men (95% CI 1.2-4.2), 1.4 in white women (95% CI 0.6-3.0) and 1.0 in blacks (95% CI 0.4-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that plasma beta TG may be useful as a marker for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in middle aged adults, particularly in white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that platelet activation has an independent role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, although the possibility that this may be a response to carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
