<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate neuropeptides in patients presenting with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The precursor neuropeptides proenkephalin A (PENK-A) and protachykinin (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) are markers of blood-brain barrier integrity and have been recently discussed in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and neuroinflammatory disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective observational study, we measured plasma PENK-A and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> concentrations in 189 consecutive patients who were admitted with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations were determined by sandwich immunoassay; lower detection limits were 15.6 pmol/l (PENK-A) and 22 pmol/l (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed at 3 months for mortality, major adverse cerebro/cardiovascular events, and functional outcome (modified Rankin scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PENK-A was significantly elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n = 124; 65.6%) compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n = 16; 8.5%) and to patients with nonischemic events (n = 49; 25.9%): median (interquartile range), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 123.8 pmol/l (93 to 160.5); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> 114.5 pmol/l (85.3 to 138.8); and nonischemic event 102.8 pmol/l (76.4 to 137.6; both groups vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of PENK-A, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, were related to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as assessed by National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS [r = 0.225; p = 0.002]) and to advanced functional disability (modified Rankin Scale score 3 to 6 vs. 0 to 2: 135.1 pmol/l [99.2 to 174.1] vs. 108.9 pmol/l [88.6 to 139.5]; p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, NIHSS, and brain lesion size (computed tomography), PENK-A predicted mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for log-10 PENK-A in pmol/l: 4.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 19.0; p &lt; 0.05) and major adverse cerebro/cardiovascular events (HR: 6.65; 95% CI: 1.8 to 24.9; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest quartile of PENK-A (cutoff &gt;153 pmol/l) had an increased risk of mortality (HR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.40; p &lt; 0.05) and of major adverse cerebro/cardiovascular events (HR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.10 to 4.54; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PENK-A is a prognostic biomarker in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated PENK-A concentrations are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, severity of cerebral injury, and may have prognostic value for fatal and nonfatal events </plain></SENT>
