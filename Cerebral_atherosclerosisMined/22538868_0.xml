<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Collateral circulation stabilizes cerebral blood flow in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion, but its prognostic role is less studied in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and appears different in moderate to severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the associations between antegrade flow across stenosis, collateral flow via leptomeningeal anastomosis, and the neurological outcome and recurrence risk in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined a cohort of consecutive patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) with symptomatic intracranial stenosis confirmed by digital subtraction angiography in a single-center retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were graded systematically in a blinded fashion for antegrade and collateral flow, using Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> (TICI) and American Society of Intervention and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) grading, respectively, and integrated to a simple composite circulation score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical variables, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 3 months, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 12 months were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of good outcome (mRS 0-2) and recurrence in a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 69 patients with pure intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> â‰¥ 50%, compromised antegrade flow (TICI 0-2a) was observed in 26 (36%) patients and was associated with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (mean 86 vs. 74%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor collateral compensation resulting in a poor composite circulation score was observed in 8 (12%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a good circulation score (n = 61, 88%) had preserved flow, which was associated with more favorable outcome (OR 7.50, 95% CI 1.11-50.7, p = 0.04) and less recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.96, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was not significantly associated with antegrade or collateral grade per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Good collateral compensations are more important in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis and compromised antegrade flow, and are associated with favorable outcome and less recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of composite flow assessment should be explored in future studies to identify high-risk intracranial stenosis with compromised hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
