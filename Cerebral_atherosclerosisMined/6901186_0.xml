<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> is a valuable therapeutic approach, and is probably more effective than medical management in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in certain patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not every patient is a candidate for surgery, and the surgeon must carefully weight the risks of angiography and surgery versus the risks of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those patients at greatest surgical risk are those with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and those who are neurologically unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy should only be considered if an experienced angiographer and surgeon who routinely perform this procedure with good results are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Older patients scheduled for major surgery should be evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> regardless of the presence of a bruit, particularly if they show evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> alsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive carotid studies are very valuable in assessing patients </plain></SENT>
