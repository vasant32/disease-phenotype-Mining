<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The reproducibility of duplex scan measures of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was evaluated as part of a study assessing the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> in elderly adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doppler measures of blood flow velocity were used to evaluate disease severity, and extent of carotid plaque was scored from the B-mode image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reader assigned a grade from 0 to 3 to each of seven segments in the carotid system, based on the number and size of lesions present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility data were obtained from 30 study participants who underwent a repeat scan by a second sonographer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each scan was then scored by two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Doppler measures of blood flow velocity were found to be highly reproducible, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.81 for the common carotid artery, 0.84 for the internal carotid artery, and 0.77 for the internal carotid artery velocity to common carotid artery velocity ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of plaque grade was evaluated using segment as the unit of analysis, and both sonographer and reader variation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When readers differed perfect agreement was achieved in 84% of the segments (K = 0.67), and when sonographers differed perfect agreement was obtained in 78% of the segments (K = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When both sonographer and reader differed, perfect agreement was obtained in 77% of the segments (K = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plaque index, created by summing plaque grades from selected segments, was highly reproducible, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The duplex scan protocol described here provides reliable measures of both extent and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> that are appropriate for use in cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
