<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type III <z:hpo ids='HP_0010980'>Hyperlipoproteinemia</z:hpo> is a rare <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorder with a frequency of 1-5 in 5000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and patients are at increased risk of developping <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type III HLP is strongly associated with the homozygous presence of the Îµ2 allele of the APOE gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However only about 10% of subjects with APOE2/2 genotype develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and it is therefore assumed that further genetic and environmental factors are necessary for the expression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that variation in the APOA5 gene is one of these co-factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the development of cerebrovascular athero?<z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in patients with Type III hyperlipopro?teinemia (Type III HLP) and the role of variation in the APOA5 gene as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 60 patients with type III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and ApoE2/2 genotype were included in the study after informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was investigated using B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were measured by standard procedures.The APOE genotype and the 1131T&gt;C and S19W SNPs in the APOA5 gene and the APOC3 sstI SNP were determined by restriction isotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies were determined by gene counting and compared using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous variables were compared using the Mann Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A p value of 0.05 or below was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using Statistica 7 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of the APOA5 SNPs, -1131T&gt;C and S19W and the APOC3 sstI SNP were determined as a potential risk modifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After correction for conventional risk factors, the C allele of the -1131T&gt;C SNP in the APOA5 gene was associated with an increased risk for the development of carotid plaque in patients with Type III HLP with an odds ratio of 3.69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the genotype distribution was compatible with an independent effect of APOA5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with Type III HLP is modulated by variation in the APOA5 gene </plain></SENT>
