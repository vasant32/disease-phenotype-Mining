<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) polymorphisms can change plasma levels of IGF-1 and may alter the function of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether there is any association of genetic variation in IGF-1R gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHOD: A 1:1 case-control study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G --&gt; A polymorphism of IGF-1R gene (rs2229765) were analyzed by TaqMan SNP genotyping technique in Chinese patients with IS (n = 309) and old subjects without IS (n = 309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of A allele in the patients and controls was 45.79% and 39.64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AA genotype distribution of IGF-1R gene was significantly higher in the patients (27.51%) than controls (18.23%; P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression revealed that the AA genotype of IGF-1R was associated with IS (OR = 1.641, P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for smoking, alcohol drinking, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and body mass index, IGF-1R AA genotype was still significantly associated with an increased risk of IS (OR = 1.787, P = 0.029), compared with IGF-1R GG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The G --&gt; A polymorphism in IGF-1R gene may affect the susceptibility to IS in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
