<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human cerebral microvessel-derived smooth muscle cells (MV-SMC) in culture can be used to study the pathogenesis of microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures were established from nonneoplastic human brain specimens surgically resected and characterized as to their growth properties and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cultures have been used to study various factors that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathies</z:e>, in particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA), to help determine mechanisms of SMC degeneration in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors investigated have included cellular growth rate, response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and amyloidogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MV-SMC appear to behave differently than aortic SMC with regard to proliferation and telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences may play a role in the responses to MV-SMC in the evolution of CAA and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathies</z:e> (cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>/lipohyalinosis) and provide insight into mechanisms of degeneration of these cells within vessel walls </plain></SENT>
