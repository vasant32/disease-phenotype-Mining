<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The AIS-APS was developed based on the China National <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry, in which eligible patients were randomly classified into derivation (60%) and internal validation cohort (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>External validation was performed using the prospective Chinese Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of in-hospital SAP after AIS were obtained using multivariable logistic regression, and Î²-coefficients were used to generate point scoring system of the AIS-APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall in-hospital SAP after AIS was 11.4%, 11.3%, and 7.3% in the derivation (n=8820), internal (n=5882) and external (n=3037) validation cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 34-point AIS-APS was developed from the set of independent predictors including age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> and current smoking, prestroke dependence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (Oxfordshire), and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AIS-APS showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) in the internal (0.785; 95% confidence interval, 0.766-0.803) and external (0.792; 95% confidence interval, 0.761-0.823) validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AIS-APS was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the internal (P=0.22) and external (P=0.30) validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When compared with 3 prior scores, the AIS-APS showed significantly better discrimination with regard to in-hospital SAP after AIS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AIS-APS is a valid risk score for predicting in-hospital SAP after AIS </plain></SENT>
