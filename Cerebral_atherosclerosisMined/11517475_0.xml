<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was determination of hydrodynamic blood resistance and Toms effect in patients with ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation in different periods of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>45 patients with atherosclerotic damages of major arteries of head were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such damages were combined with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 32 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of hematocrit, asymptotic viscosity, hydrodynamic resistance and Toms' effect were determined in blood as well as levels of cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39026">beta-lipoproteins</z:chebi> and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of Toms' effect was found in blood samples of both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase of hydrodynamic blood resistance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients as compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation were compensated by their own blood factor in less degree in acutest and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> periods than later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low values of Toms' effect in separate patients were prognostic sings for good restoration of neurologic functions; higher values were observed in patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was made that hemodynamic properties of blood flow may be considered as predictors of the severity of the course of cerebral circulation disorders </plain></SENT>
