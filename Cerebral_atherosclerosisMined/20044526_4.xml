<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between the thickness of the carotid intima (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and brain function remains unclear in those without clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the neural correlates of this vascular measure is important in view of emerging evidence linking poorer cognitive performance with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in individuals without clinical cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-three participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (70.9 years; SD, 7.3) were evaluated with carotid artery ultrasound and resting [(15)O]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and gray and white matter volumes in the regions where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is related to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we found that higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was associated with lower rCBF in lingual, inferior occipital, and superior temporal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was also associated with higher rCBF in medial frontal gyrus, putamen, and hippocampal-uncal regions (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas women had lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P=0.01) and mean arterial pressure (P=0.05) than men, they showed more robust associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and rCBF was only minimally affected by additional adjustment for mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is related to patterns of resting rCBF in older adults without clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that there are regional differences in CBF that are associated with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
