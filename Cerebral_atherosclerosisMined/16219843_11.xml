<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although stent-assisted intracranial procedures are becoming a routine clinical practice, there have been relatively few large studies published in the literature regarding the application of the balloon-expandable stent technology in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, the authors reviewed their experience with 75 cases at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, 75 patients underwent percutaneous transluminal intracranial stent placement as a treatment for wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the target lesions, technical details of the procedures, device functionality, procedure-related complications, and short-term outcomes were reviewed in a retrospective fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical indications included wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (59) and atherosclerotic stenoses (16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stent was successfully deployed in 92% of the patients (69 of 75 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 6 cases, the causes of failed stent deployment included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosities</z:hpo> (2), stent migration (2), fracture of the stent (1), and arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcome (mean follow-up, 7.5 months; range, 3-12 months) was evaluated by using the modified Rankin scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy 0-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients (70.6%) had excellent outcomes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy 0-1), 12 (16%) had good outcomes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy 2), and 5 (6.7%) had poor outcomes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (6.7%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi> is associated with a high rate of hemorrhagic and ischemic complications, more specifically when used in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cases of large-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> not treatable with balloon remodeling technique and atheromatous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> could be eligible for this treatment </plain></SENT>
