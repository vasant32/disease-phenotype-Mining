<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) constitutes the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AD-related pathology is often accompanied by vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predominant vascular lesions in AD are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>/lipohyalinosis (AS/LH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to examine the coincidence of these small vessel pathologies during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, amyloid beta-protein (A beta) deposition, and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We correlated the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating (CDR) score, the sequential extension of AD-related A beta deposition into different parts of the brain, and the extension of NFTs to involve more brain regions with the distribution of CAA and AS/LH in 52 human autopsy brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extension of CAA and AS/LH to involve different areas of the brain was associated with a rise of CDR scores and an increase in the extension of A beta deposition and NFT generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD cases showed a higher number of regions with CAA and AS/LH compared to nondemented patients with AD-related pathology and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated a hierarchical sequence in which the different regions of the brain exhibited CAA and AS/LH-affected vessels, allowing the distinction of 3 stages in the development of CAA and AS/LH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first stage of CAA involved leptomeningeal and neocortical vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second stage was characterized by additional A beta deposition in allocortical and midbrain vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a third stage, CAA was observed in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and in the lower brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AS/LH initially affected the basal ganglia in stage A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In stage B this pathology made inroads into the deep white matter, the leptomeningeal arteries of the cortex, the cerebellum, and into the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stage C was characterized by AS/LH in brainstem vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate widespread CAA and AS/LH to be associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A combination of both CAA and AS/LH may, therefore, contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data also suggest that small vessel disease due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and fibrolipohyalinosis is a potential target for the treatment of AD </plain></SENT>
