<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatients metabolic clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixty type IIa, 50 type IIb and 40 type IV hyperlipidaemic subjects were compared with 50 normolipidaemic controls, matched for sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> analysis for phenotype classification was performed after two months of diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was measured by a zero-random sphygmomanometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHD risk factors, smoking habit, previous and ongoing drug therapy were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echo-Doppler examination of the extracranial arteries (common, internal and external carotid artery and bulb) was done by a Multigon Angioview 600 provided with a 7.5 MHz probe for B-mode and 5 MHz for pulsed Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified as having carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> when a plaque and/or a stenosis was found in at least one of the examined segments and as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when no <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were more hypertensives among type IV subjects whereas the prevalence of smokers and diabetics was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was higher in type IIb and IIa subjects than in controls (58% and 38% respectively vs 14%, p&lt;0.01) while in type IV subjects it was comparable to that of controls (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020474" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FCHL">mixed hyperlipidaemia</z:e> are frequently associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, whereas hypertriglyceridaemia is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The role of hypertriglyceridaemia in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> seems mediated by mechanisms other than plaque formation </plain></SENT>
