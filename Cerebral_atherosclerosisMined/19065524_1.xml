<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ACI from the Department of Neurology of Taizhou Hospital and 226 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum MMP-3 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the common 5A/6A functional promoter polymorphism of the MMP-3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the MMP-3 promoter 5A/6A polymorphism between the ACI patients group and the control group was significantly different (chi (2)= 9.389, P= 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the 5A allele were 14.2% and 7.7% in the ACI patients group and the control group respectively (chi (2)= 9.430, P= 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum level of MMP-3 in the ACI patients group was significantly higher than that in the control group (t= 24.867, P= 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the ACI patients group, serum MMP-3 levels also had significant difference between the 5A/6A+ 5A/5A and the 6A/6A genotype (t= 2.057, P= 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that serum level of MMP-3 obviously increased within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the genetic polymorphism of 5A/6A in the MMP-3 promoter is associated with ACI and MMP-3 expression in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
