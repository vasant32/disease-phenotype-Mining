<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of variance at XbaI site of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (ApoB) gene and atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) in Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, we studied the restrict fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at XbaI site of ApoB gene in 150 patients with ACI and 301 healthy age, sex-matched individuals from a population of Chinese Han nationality in Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both ACI group and control group, X-X- genotype was the most frequent one (frequency: 0.907, 0.948) and we did not find X+X+ genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of genotypes in the two groups was at the Hardy-Weiberg equilibriums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of rare allele X+ was significantly lower in Chinese Han than that reported in Caucasians (0.027 vs 0.418, 0.454, 0.479, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of rare allele X+ was found in the ACI group as compared with the control group (0.053 vs 0.027, P &lt; 0.05). markedly increased levels of TC (5.3 +/- 1.3), (4.9 +/- 1.3) mmol/L (P &lt; 0.05), and low levels of Apo-AI, Apo-AI/ApoB in the ACI group were observed (1.02 +/- 0.34), (1.26 +/- 0.40) g/L, (P &lt; 0.01); X+X- genotype was associated with higher levels of ApoB compared with the levels of X-X- genotype in the ACI group (0.89 +/- 0.29) g/L, (0.78 +/- 0.17) g/L (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: X+ allele of ApoB gene may be associated with ACI to some extent in the Chinese population, and presumbly through its effect on ApoB metabolism it increases the susceptibility to ACI </plain></SENT>
