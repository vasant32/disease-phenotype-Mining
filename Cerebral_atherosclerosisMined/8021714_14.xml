<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which ranged in size from 2 mm to 3 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes consistent with the earliest stages of atherogenesis, so-called "fatty streaks," were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the smallest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were characterized by diffuse intimal thickening composed predominantly of proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMC) with a small number of macrophages and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> with cellular infiltrates composed mostly of macrophages, more mature looking SMC and a greater number of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression was detected predominantly in macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some SMC in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, but not in diffuse intimal thickening, had MHC class II immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant number of lymphocytes and NK cells were found at the site of aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> within the aneurysmal sac correlated positively with aneurysmal growth, and we speculate may have contributed to aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some evidence also suggested a possible role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the formation of berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
