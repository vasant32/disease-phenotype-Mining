<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The attributes to be judged were: lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (yes/no), leuko-araiosis (decreased density of the cerebral white matter) (yes/no), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> (yes/no), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (yes/no) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chance corrected kappa coefficients were 0.641 for decreased density, 0.445 for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 0.206 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration the attribute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, the kappa coefficient for the attribute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was 0.330, and without taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> into consideration, it was 0.523 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and of leuko-araiosis should be based on clear definitions in order to guarantee a minimum level of interrater agreement </plain></SENT>
