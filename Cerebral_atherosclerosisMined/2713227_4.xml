<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient neurologic symptoms have necessitated surgical intervention to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite concern over technical problems, wound healing, operative risks, and uncertain therapeutic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this report, 26 surgical procedures in 20 patients are now documented in the literature (12 men--60%; eight women--40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age of these patients (56 years) was 10 years younger than carotid surgery patients with no prior radiation history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relationship was noted between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated serum cholesterol</z:hpo> and the subsequent development of radiation-induced carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures performed included carotid endarterectomy in 17 cases (65%) and arterial bypass in nine (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of radiation therapy and previous neck surgery, including prior radical neck dissection, did not adversely influence operability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical outcome was uniformly good with only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4%) documented in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up on our six cases (mean two years) disclosed neither new clinical symptoms nor the development of hemodynamically significant restenosis </plain></SENT>
