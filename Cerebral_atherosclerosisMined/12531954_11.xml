<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In idiopathic adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> syndrome (IAHS), a pathophysiological model of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>" caused by an arteriosclerotic process in association with a CSF hydrodynamic disturbance has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CSF hydrodynamic manipulation has an impact on biochemical markers related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, brain tissue oxygen tension (PtiO(2)), and intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A microdialysis catheter, a PtiO(2) probe, and an intracerebral pressure catheter were inserted into the periventricular white matter 0-7 mm from the right frontal horn in 10 patients with IAHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subcutaneous microdialysis probe was used as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure and intracerebral PtiO(2) were recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected for analysis between 2 and 4 pm on day 1 (baseline) and at the same time on day 2, two to four hours after a lumbar CSF hydrodynamic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> on day 1 and 2 were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After CSF drainage, there was a significant rise in the intracerebral concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio was increased and remained unchanged after drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a lowering of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean intracerebral PtiO(2) was higher on day 2 than on day 1 in six of eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism after CSF drainage, as expected in a situation of postischaemic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These new invasive techniques are promising tools in the future study of the pathophysiological processes in IAHS </plain></SENT>
