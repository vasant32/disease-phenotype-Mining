<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have been using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) preoperatively to identify patients at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based upon the intracranial MRA findings, either the off-pump or the on-pump procedure was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of our MRA-based strategy of CABG in 140 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arterial lesions were found in 90 patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most affected arteries were internal carotid (48%), followed by vertebral (18%) and middle cerebral (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the MRA score describing the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 35 patients with a score of &gt; or = 5 underwent off-pump, while 105 patients with a score of &lt; 5 underwent on-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the off-pump group, the patient age was older, the incidence of abnormal preoperative brain CT was higher, and the MRA score was higher (6.0+/-1.1 vs. 1.2+/-1.3 points) than in the on-pump groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though the risk was higher in the off-pump group, the clinical outcomes were not significantly different, including the hospital mortality and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and additional coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the brain MRA-based selection of off-pump CABG can contribute to prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in neurologically high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
