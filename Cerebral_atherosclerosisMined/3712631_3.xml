<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were unable to reproduce these findings; therefore, our patient population was reinvestigated to ascertain the importance of repeated plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and their possible relationship to the production of neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 95 carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques were separated into three groups: those from patients with lateralizing symptoms, nonlateralizing symptoms, and no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the plaques were inspected microscopically for evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, specifically, repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were found in 29 of 44 plaques (66%) in the lateralizing symptom group, 6 of 19 (32%) in the nonlateralizing symptom group, and 12 of 32 (37%) in the no symptom group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that repeated rather than single intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is the critical factor related to the production of specific cerebrovascular ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
