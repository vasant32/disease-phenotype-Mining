<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have reported elevated circulating homocyst(e)ine levels in subjects with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed prospectively whether high plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine affect risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and evaluated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> modifies any such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample was drawn from the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> in 22,071 US male physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 14,916 subjects 40 to 84 years old with no prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> provided blood samples at baseline and were followed for 5 years, with 99.7% morbidity and 100% mortality follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a nested case-control design, we assayed homocyst(e)ine in samples from 109 subjects who subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 427 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration of homocyst(e)ine was slightly higher in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (11.1 +/- 4.0 [+/- SD] nmol/mL) than in control subjects (10.6 +/- 3.4 nmol/mL), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crude odds ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for subjects in the upper 20% (&gt; 12.7 nmol/mL) compared with those in the bottom 80% of homocyst(e)ine levels was 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.0) after controlling for several risk factors and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, elevated homocyst(e)ine levels appeared to be more strongly predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in normotensive subjects and in men 60 years or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, in these subgroups increases in risks of 100% and 70%, respectively, were observed for men in the upper 20% of homocyst(e)ine values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the data were compatible with a small but nonsignificant association between elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, since the sample size is small and the confidence intervals are wide, either no association or a moderate increase in risk cannot be excluded, particularly in subgroups otherwise at low risk, eg, younger men and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure </plain></SENT>
