<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611713" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome</z:e> (CHS) is occasionally seen after vascular reconstruction and manifest clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence and clinical features of CHS after vascular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 144 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (53 carotid endarterectomy [CEA] for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 48 carotid artery stenting [CAS] for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 20 bypass surgery for atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, 40 bypass surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> [MMD]) underwent vascular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined neurologically and radiologically, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi>-emission computed tomography, and then CHS was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CHS developed in 1 (1.9%) CEA, 1 (2.1%) CAS, 1 (5.0%) bypass surgery for atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, and 6 (15.0%) bypass surgery for MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CHS was significantly higher in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aged patients and impairment of cerebrovascular reserve were correlated with CHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> after CEA and complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffuse hemispheric hyperperfusion was detected by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi>-emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, MMD patients manifested focal neurologic deficit, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, and increased regional cerebral blood flow around vascular anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated with blood pressure control and administration of free radical scavengers, and recovered without permanent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CHS is significantly higher in patients with MMD and results in vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> visible on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
