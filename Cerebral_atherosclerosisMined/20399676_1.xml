<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with significant cerebrovascular disease after off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, 611 patients, who underwent off-pump CABG, were divided into high-risk (n=196) and low-risk groups (n=415) for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using preoperative brain magnetic resonance angiography/imaging and cervical Doppler sonography, and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the two groups was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No 'intra-operative' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, seven patients (3.6%) in the high-risk group and one patient (0.2%) in the low-risk group developed 'delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>' between the day of surgery and postoperative day 18 (mean postoperative day 8.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant aetiology of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was thrombo-embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assignment to the high-risk group had a significant association with the occurrence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The person-time incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the high-risk group was much higher within 1 month (3.57) after CABG than beyond 1 month (0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with significant cerebrovascular disease did not develop intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these patients were likely to suffer from delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 30 days of surgery </plain></SENT>
