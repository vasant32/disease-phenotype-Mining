<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advanced carotid and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> reduce common carotid blood flow volume due to increased resistance of peripheral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to a study in which clinical and pathological specimens were compared, the lower threshold for the flow volume in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals has been confirmed to be 6.5 ml/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possibility that the development of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases can be predicted based on blood flow volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 314 patients who were available for determination of common carotid blood flow volume with an ultrasonic quantitative flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients developed ischemic cerebrovascular attacks during the observation period (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group), while the remaining 281 did not develop attacks (non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discriminating value for common carotid blood flow volume between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> groups was 6.8 ml/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on an odds ratio of 6.7, it was concluded that a common carotid blood flow volume of less than 6.8 ml/s is highly likely to predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
