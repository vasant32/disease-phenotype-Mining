<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was to evaluate the retrobulbar hemodynamics in patients who have transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (TMB) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who have TMB without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were studied along with 59 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler-imaging was used to study the retrobulbar hemodynamic by measuring the flow velocities (peak-systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity), vascular resistance indices (pulsatility index, and resistance index) in central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries, short posterior ciliary arteries, and ophthalmic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the attack frequency: group 1 (occasional TMB, 2 or fewer attacks, 26 patients) and group 2 (frequent TMB, 3 or more attacks, 33 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were similar between the cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The means of end-diastolic velocity were significantly lower in central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries and ophthalmic arteries, and the pulsatility index and resistance index were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 retrobulbar vessels in TMB patients than for the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences between patients and controls were greater for the group-2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have TMB without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> had altered retrobulbar hemodynamics with a generalized increase in vascular resistance in the retrobulbar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The role of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as an etiology needs further study </plain></SENT>
