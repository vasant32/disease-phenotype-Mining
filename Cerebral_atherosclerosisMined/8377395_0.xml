<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study we have reviewed the clinical records of 150 patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy between 1983 and 1990 in Kantonsspital Aarau/Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18.6% biopsies were histologically classified as temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To judge the indication for temporal artery biopsy the combination of symptoms leading to biopsy and the histologic results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were divided in unspecific, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, loss of weight or malaise, and more specific symptoms as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, jaw <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, loss of visual acuity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, tenderness of temporal artery, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pmr">polymyalgia rheumatica</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the result of this study is that temporal artery biopsy may be an important help in the diagnosis of temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> in cases with one or two specific symptoms, at which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pmr">polymyalgia rheumatica</z:e> is a questionable indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our opinion temporal artery biopsy is not indicated in cases with isolated elevation of ESR, one or more unspecific symptoms and three or more specific symptoms, because there no diagnostic profit can be suspected </plain></SENT>
