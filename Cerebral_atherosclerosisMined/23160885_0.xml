<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, Web-based registry was performed on atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> using diffusionweighted magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were categorized as artery-to-artery embolism, in situ thrombo-occlusion, local branch occlusion, or hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Onethousand patients were enrolled from 9 university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.033; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.018-1.049), male gender (OR, 3.399; 95% CI, 2.335-4.949), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (OR, 1.502; 95% CI, 1.117-2.018) were factors favoring ECAS (vs ICAS), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 1.826; 95% CI, 1.274-2.618; P=0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR, 1.490; 95% CI, 1.105-2.010; P=0.009) were related to posterior (vs anterior) circulation diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was a factor related to ICAS (vs ECAS) only in posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (OR, 2.433; 95% CI, 1.005-5.890; P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms included arterytoartery embolism (59.7%), local branch occlusion (14.9%), in situ thrombo-occlusion (13.7%), hemodynamic impairment (0.9%), and mixed (10.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior ICAS was more often associated with artery-to-artery embolism (51.8% vs 34.0%) and less often associated with local branch occlusion (12.3% vs 40.4%) than posterior ICAS (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms differ between ICAS and ECAS, and between anterior and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posterior ICAS seems to be closely associated with metabolic derangement and local branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevention and management strategies may have to consider these differences </plain></SENT>
