<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these methods are sufficiently informative, reliable, and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the methods meeting these requirements is noninvasive cerebral oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out by the Invos-3100 device (Somanetics, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method of cerebral oximetry is based on optic spectroscopy using infrared light in the 650-1100 nm waveband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was carried out in 34 patients with involvement of the brachiocephalic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results persuasively prove high informative value and safety of the method </plain></SENT>
