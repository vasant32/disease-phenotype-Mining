<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed by using Doppler ultrasound techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It revealed three different types of collateral blood flow of the brain according to the function of orbital anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors propose a new unique assessment of indications for a reconstructive operation on the external carotid artery for brain revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criteria proposed by the authors for assessing the cerebral hemodynamics enable the clear-cut indications for the above operation to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The paper also summarizes the experience in examining and surgically managing 38 patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, who underwent revascularization of 39 channels of the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
