<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the risk factors for intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS), particularly among asymptomatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a consecutive series of 1,208 subjects aged &gt; or =40 years, with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and who had undergone transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of classic risk factors was assessed in the presence and severity of asymptomatic ICAS, which was determined by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regarding the presence of ICAS, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: 1.22 (1.08-1.37) for every 10-year increase in age, 1.44 (1.08-1.91) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 1.86 (1.33-2.59) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed with regard to male sex, smoking or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are significant risk factors for ICAS in asymptomatic populations </plain></SENT>
