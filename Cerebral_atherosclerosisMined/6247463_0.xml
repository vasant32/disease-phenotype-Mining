<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rise in urinary cAMP up to 45 microM/24h was observed (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values being 1 to 5 microM/24h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found a correlation between the severity of the clinical conditions, recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disorder and cAMP excretion, thus suggesting that an increase of urinary cAMP level is related to the extent and the evolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
