<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, when compared with controls, patients with a history of cerebrovascular events were also older, and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and left ventricular disease (ejection fraction &lt; 45%) more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal carotid duplex scans were also very common in this group (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography is useful for evaluating the risk of cerebrovascular complications in non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the method is quite insensitive (61%) and therefore insufficient as the sole parameter for deciding the need for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is likely that cerebrovascular complications in these polymorbid patients are partially caused by other factors than embolism from the left atrium </plain></SENT>
