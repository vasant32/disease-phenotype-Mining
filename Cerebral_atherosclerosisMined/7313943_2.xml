<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over a 26-month period 27 urgent carotid endarterectomies were performed on patients who had been taking antiplatelet aggregating drugs for 6 months to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed an original diagnosis of symptomatic extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and ulceration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen had been started on dosages of aspirin from 325 to 1,300 mg/day, and eight started on aspirin plus persantine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compliance to aspirin use appeared high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had partial or total resolution of the ischemic symptoms after aspirin therapy was instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On readmission three patients had early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in evolution, and 24 had crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reevaluation included cerebral angiography which confirmed progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> to 90% or greater stenosis in each instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent successful carotid endarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A review of history of these 27 in the urgent group as opposed to the 45 symptomatic carotid patients who were electively operated on in the same time period revealed no significant (P greater than 0.10) differences in incidence of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the elective group had regularly taken aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It would appear that aspirin decreased ischemic symptoms in the patients who underwent urgent operation by its antithromboxane effect, inhibiting platelet aggregation and embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, aspirin appeared to have a deleterious effect on these patients by allowing their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> to progress to a dangerous state by eliminating the symptoms of progressive carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or by accentuating the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> possibly by inhibition of arterial prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
