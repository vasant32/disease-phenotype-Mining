<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten ex vivo carotid arteries were scanned fresh at body and room temperature and formalin-fixed and decalcified at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different spin-echo pulse sequences were used and absolute T2 values calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During processing for histopathology, the contrast between the arterial layers increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From body to room temperature there were significant increases in size (4%-7%), T2 of media (60--&gt; 68 msec), and fibrous plaque component (95--&gt; 110 msec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixation caused significant increases in size (2%-3%) and media T2 (68--&gt; 74 msec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_48'>Decalcification</z:mpath> caused significant shrinkage (2%-5%) and decrease in T2 of media (74--&gt; 53 msec) and fibrous plaque component (118--&gt; 76 msec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus temperature and preparation have profound effects on contrast, size, and T2 of atherosclerotic arteries </plain></SENT>
