<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> resulting from an occlusion of a perforating artery, and account for about a quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some new investigations indicate that subcortical lacunar lesions may have a greater chance of causing a progressive cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than deep lacunar lesions in future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of subcortical and deep lacunar lesions and its association with large vessel atherosclerotic infarction at the Ali-Ibne-Abi Taleb Hospital, Rafsanjan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling of patients with clinical suspicion of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of large vessel atherosclerotic infarction was confirmed with carotid Duplex/Trancranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then patients with lacunar lesions on MRI were assessed about their locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed by SPSS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 57.8% of patients were women and 42.2% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>58.6% of patients were older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>67.8% of patients had deep lacunar lesions, 28.3% had subcortical lacunar lesions, and 3.9% had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>56.11% had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, 80.1% had deep lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were significantly higher among the patients with deep lacunar lesion (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between large vessel atherosclerotic infarction and the site of lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are risk factors for deep lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
