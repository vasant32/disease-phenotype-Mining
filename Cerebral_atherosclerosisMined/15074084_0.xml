<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were randomly divided into the treated group treated with conventional medical treatment plus YXQN and the control group treated with conventional medical treatment alone, to observe the changes before and after treatment in scores of chief symptoms, mean velocity of cerebral blood flow (VM), plasma nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), calcitonin gene related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) and endothelin (ET) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) After treatment in treated group, the scores of chief symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> were significantly lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01); (2) NO and CGRP level in the treated group after treatment obviously elevated, and ET and VM markedly reduced (P &lt; 0.01), while no evident change of these parameters was found in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The efficacy of YXQN in treating cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is definite, modulating the level of vasoactive factors was its important mechanism </plain></SENT>
