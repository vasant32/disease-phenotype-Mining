<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KAPS (Kuopio <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Prevention Study) is the first population-based trial in the primary prevention of carotid and femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The eligibility requirements were serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> &gt; or = 4.0 mmol/L and total cholesterol &lt; 7.5 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of a geographically defined population, 447 men aged 44 to 65 years (mean, 57) were randomized to pravastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less than 10% of the subjects had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine men discontinued study medication; however, efficacy data were available for 424 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the rate of carotid atherosclerotic progression, measured as the linear slope over annual ultrasound examinations in the average of the maximum carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the far wall of up to four arterial segments (the right and left distal common carotid artery and the right and left carotid bulb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the carotid arteries, at the overall mean baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of 1.66 mm, the rate of progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 45% (95% CI, 16 to 69%) less in the pravastatin (0.017 mm/y) than the placebo (0.031 mm/y) group (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the common carotid artery there was a treatment effect of 66% (95% CI, 30 to 95%; pravastatin 0.010 mm/y; placebo 0.029 mm/y; P &lt; .002) at the overall mean baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of 1.35 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A treatment effect of 30% (95% CI, -1% to 54%) was found for the carotid bulb (pravastatin, 0.028; placebo, 0.040; P = .056) at the overall mean baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of 2.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment effect was larger in subjects with higher baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values, in smokers and in those with low plasma vitamin E levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant treatment effect on atherosclerotic progression in the femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data establish the antiatherogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> lowering by pravastatin in hypercholesterolemic men in a primary prevention setting and suggest a greater effect in smokers than in nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
