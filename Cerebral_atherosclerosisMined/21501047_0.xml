<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report includes the EC-IC bypass experience of a single centre over a period of 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive 72 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular lesions associated with haemodynamic compromise treated by EC-IC bypass surgery were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively, 61% of patients presented with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the remaining 39% with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) despite maximal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis/occlusion in 79%, bilateral ICA stenosis/occlusion in 15%, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis/occlusion in 3% and other multiple vessel stenosis/occlusion in 3% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H(2)(15)O <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) or 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge was performed for haemodynamic evaluation of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had impaired haemodynamics pre-operatively in terms of reduced regional cerebrovascular reserve capacity and rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standard STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass procedure was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 68 patients with 82 bypasses were reviewed with a mean follow-up period of 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence took place in 10 patients (15%) resulting in an annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improved cerebral haemodynamics was documented in 81% of revascularised hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with unchanged or worse haemodynamic parameters had significantly more post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> when compared to those with improved perfusion reserves (30% vs.5% of patients, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EC-IC bypass procedure in selected patients with occlusive cerebrovascular lesions associated with haemodynamic impairment has revealed to be effective for prevention of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, when compared with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk rate of 15% reported to date in patients only under antiplatelet agents or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
