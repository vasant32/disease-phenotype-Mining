<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although black-blood MRI (BB-MRI) can identify plaques in the cervical carotid arteries, this modality has not been applied in intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We imaged the lumina and walls of stenotic middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using high-resolution BB-MRI, in order to characterize vulnerable plaques and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of BB-MRI in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multicontrast (T(1), T(2) and proton density)-weighted BB-MRIs were acquired in 15 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and in 2 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was classified into one of three groups based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic findings and symptoms: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, symptomatic stenosis, or asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plaque signal intensity was interpreted and the total wall thickness was measured at the most stenotic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values were then compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> using t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For assessment of lumen imaging, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis graded on BB-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images was compared with that graded on conventional angiography (digital subtraction angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were evaluated (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>: 12, symptomatic stenoses: 7, and asymptomatic stenoses: 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T(1)- and/or T(2)-hyperintense foci were demonstrated more frequently within the plaques of symptomatic stenoses than within the plaques of asymptomatic stenoses (57.1 vs. 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total wall thickness in the symptomatic stenoses was significantly higher than that seen in the asymptomatic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stenosis grade for the BB-MRI was significantly correlated with the digital subtraction angiography grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-resolution, multicontrast-weighted BB-MRI has the potential to characterize atherosclerotic plaques in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and may be a useful modality for evaluating the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
