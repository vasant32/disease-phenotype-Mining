<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finally we performed a logistic discriminant analysis of 15 selected variables in order to establish diagnostic discriminant formulas, Ya and Yc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that a diagnostic coincidence rate for rediscriminant analysis of 212 individuals with the formulas was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very high sensitivity (96.7%), specificity (100%), positive predicted value (100%), negative predicted value (83.3%) and accuracy (97.1%) were noted in a prospective double-blind test on 34 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that the discriminant formulas Ya and Yc established for diagnosis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> be widely applicated </plain></SENT>
