<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In a previous in vitro study we have demonstrated that atherosclerotic plaque components can be characterized with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) based on differences in Hounsfield values (HV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now we evaluated the use of MDCT in vivo to characterize and quantify atherosclerotic carotid plaque components compared with histology as reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen symptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt;70%) underwent MDCT angiography before carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From each CEA specimen 3 histological sections and corresponding MDCT images were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HV of the major plaque components were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measured HV were: 657+/-416HU, 88+/-18HU, and 25+/-19HU for calcifications, fibrous tissue, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value to differentiate <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core from fibrous tissue and fibrous tissue from calcifications was based on these measurements and set at 60 HU and 130 HU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression plots showed good correlations (R2&gt;0.73) between MDCT and histology except for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core areas, which had a good correlation (R2=0.77) only in mildly calcified (0% to 10%) plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MDCT is able to quantify total plaque area, calcifications, and fibrous tissue in atherosclerotic carotid plaques in good correlation with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> core can only be adequately quantified in mildly calcified plaques </plain></SENT>
