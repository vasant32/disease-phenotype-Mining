<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available images would be very time consuming, and in practice the image quality (IQ) of these images may be inconsistent, which can directly impact the quality of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that if IQ is comparable among different contrast weighted images, then carotid artery area measurements obtained from different contrast images of the same location will produce identical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, T1, proton density and T2 weighted images were acquired from ten patients (51 +/- 7 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid lumen and vessel wall area was measured using a custom designed software program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed strong agreement evidenced with only small differences on both lumen (mean: 40.5 mm(2)) and wall (mean: 52.6 mm(2)) area measurement among different weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum absolute mean differences are less than 2.7 mm(2) and 4.4 mm(2), and 90(th) percentile of the absolute differences are 5.6 mm(2) and 8.2 mm(2) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, different contrast weighted images with high and comparable IQ will yield similar results in lumen and vessel wall area measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At each matched location, it is recommended that the image with the highest IQ be used for area measurement </plain></SENT>
