<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative refractory time is independent of age, the absolute refractory time increased with advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In genuine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with 3/s spike-waves the relative refractory period is shortened compared with the reference group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> the relative refractory time is distinctly increases in sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> on conduction in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most distinct delays of refractory period are in cases with cerebrovascular disease and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the clinical and neurophysiological results shows, that the single and double stimulation of the median nerve, combined with the analysis of the evoked potentials and the cerebral refractory period, is a good neurophysiologic cerebral function-test </plain></SENT>
