<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenoses has previously been based on balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or the deployment of a balloon expandable stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both methods have advantages (balloon: flexibility; balloon expandable stent: high radial force) and drawbacks (balloon: risk of elastic recoil and dissection; balloon expandable stent: limited flexibility, risk of injury to the vessel due to excessive straightening, overexpansion at ends of stent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new combination of balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, followed by the deployment of a self-expanding microstent has been applied in 15 patients with atherosclerotic arterial stenoses, symptomatic despite medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An anatomically and clinically adequate result was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial degree of stenosis was 72% (mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> resulted in an average residual stenosis of 54% (mean), reduced further to a mean of 38% after stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>Arterial dissection</z:hpo>, occlusion of the target artery or symptomatic distal emboli was not encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a side branch occlusion occurred after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of a M1 stenosis, with complete neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were either stable or improved 4 weeks after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> did not occur in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and subsequent deployment of a self-expandable stent for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenoses combines the advantages of both techniques and allows a rapid, clinically effective and technically safe treatment of these frequently challenging lesions </plain></SENT>
