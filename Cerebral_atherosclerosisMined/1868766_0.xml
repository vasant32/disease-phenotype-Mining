<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate for arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the first-degree relatives of the cases was higher than that in the first-degree relatives of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The heritability was estimated as 41 +/- 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference of heritability between males and females was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of less than 65 years of age was most closely associated with genetic factor in the three subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genetic factor plays an important role in the etiology of arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, especially in those with middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
