<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of poor response to treatment, the animal was euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gross examination revealed abundant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in both lateral ventricles; a large, encapsulated mass within the rostral interthalamic region; and a well-demarcated, round white mass in the apex of the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the interthalamic mass revealed a resolving <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> composed of stratified layers of fibrin and white blood cells that was surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most meningeal and intraparenchymal blood vessels had multifocal degeneration, fragmentation, and fraying of the internal elastic lamina with prominent intimal proliferations and plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plaques were formed by small numbers of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-laden macrophages (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>) that were intermixed with occasional lymphocytes and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiac mass was composed of pallisading and interlacing spindle cells with parallel nuclei and abundant, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm consistent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
