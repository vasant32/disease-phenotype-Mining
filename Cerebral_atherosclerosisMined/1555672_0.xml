<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A human carotid artery was placed in a pulsatile circuit with a roller pump and tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intimal lesions (1-5 mm) were created and ultrasonography and biplane arteriography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonograms and arteriograms obtained were interpreted by three observers, who were blind to the procedures performed and the results were compared to the macroscopic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean sensitivity between observers for ultrasonography was 84% with a specificity of 95.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For biplane arteriography the mean sensitivity was 42% with a specificity of 94.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences between ultrasonography and biplane arteriography were statistically significant (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded from this is concluded from this in vitro study that ultrasonography provides more accurate information concerning intimal lesions of the arterial wall than biplane arteriography </plain></SENT>
