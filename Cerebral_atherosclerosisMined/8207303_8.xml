<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From January 1988 to December 1989, we performed a total of 278 carotid thromboendarterectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The endarterectomized plaque was systematically confined for anatomopathological analysis by standard light microscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors looked for clinicopathologic correlation of the histology of the endarterectomy specimen with the clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty eight plaques were not suitable for analysis and classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 250 plaques were subdivided in 216 (36%) complicated plaques and 34 (14%) simple fibrous plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the complicated plaques, the pathologist described one or more of the following pathologic characteristics: organized intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (observed in 115 plaques), fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (50), ulceration (92), and recent intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (168) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than one anatomopathologic aspect were observed in most of the complicated plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty three percent of these complicated plaques were symptomatic with corresponding neurologic deficit (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), versus 21% of the simple plaques (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For plaque characteristics the only significant clinicopathologic correlation was found in plaques with fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> which were symptomatic in 70% of cases, and ulcerated plaques (symptomatic in 66% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This comparative study yielded no significant evidence of increased predisposition to neurologic deficit for the other morphological aspects (intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, healed ulceration, organized <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The histology of the endarterectomy specimen was compared with the preoperative echopattern of 154 plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty four ultrasound images were of poor quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 120 adequate echographies revealed 22 dense hyperechogenic homogenous plaques, 28 soft hypoechogenic homogenous plaques, 53 inhomogenous plaques, and 13 mixed plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>According to the surface, lesions were subdivided as smooth (N. = 63) or irregular (N. = 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echography recognized fibrous plaques (dense homogenous hyperechogenous lesions), with a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recent intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is echographically apparent as a hypoechogenic area in 88% of cases, what corresponds to a specificity of 79% and a sensitivity of 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Echography proved to be more accurate than angiography in determining the presence or absence of ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The study evidenced that plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> rather than <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing plays a primary role in cerebral ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The ability to characterize the pathology of carotid atheroma by duplex scan makes the clinicopathologic correlation of carotid plaques of practical importance </plain></SENT>
