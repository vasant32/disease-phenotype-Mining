<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 83 patients evaluated by means of carotid arterial Doppler ultrasonography and echoCG; the variables of central homodynamic were measured as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study revealed that patients with AH and moderate CCA stenosis displayed hyperkinetic hemodynamic type more often than patients with severe CCA stenosis, of whom hypodynamic hemodynamic type was more typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling was more frequent in the latter group of patients; asymmetric LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> prevailed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study shows that the process of remodeling, caused by dissociation between central and regional hemodynamics, develops together with the progress of atherosclerotic arterial lesion </plain></SENT>
