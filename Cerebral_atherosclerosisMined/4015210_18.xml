<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this period, 39 men (mean age, 60 years) and 22 women (mean age, 63 years) required 65 reoperations (3.8%) for correction of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> occurring 3 to 194 months (mean, 42 months) after previous endarterectomy at this center (N = 43) or elsewhere (N = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remedial procedures were necessary because of restenosis demonstrated by routine noninvasive testing in 32 asymptomatic lesions and because of neurologic symptoms in 33 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean recurrence interval was 57 postoperative months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (N = 37) in comparison to 21 months (p = 0.0007) for myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (N = 28), and was 48 months for men in comparison to 31 months for women (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> appeared to be associated with late atherosclerotic recurrence (p = 0.05), but was not a feature of myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch angioplasty (N = 59) or graft replacement (N = 3) was employed during 62 of the 65 reoperations, with a total of two operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3.1%), one nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.5%), and six transient cranial nerve injuries (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three unrelated late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have occurred within a mean follow-up period of 23 months, but only three patients have experienced subsequent neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
