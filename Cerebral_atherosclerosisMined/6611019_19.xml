<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) occurs initially, followed by a fall in blood flow (CBF) and, finally, a fall in oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By measuring CBV, CBF, and CMRO2 with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in patients with vasospasm associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and in patients with arteriosclerotic occlusion or stenosis of extraparenchymal cerebral arteries, we have demonstrated the presence of similar changes distal to such lesions in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the presence of a local decrease in perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the utility of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in the assessment of cerebral circulation and metabolism in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of regional CBV must be included for a complete assessment of the dynamics of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
