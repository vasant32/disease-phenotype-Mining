<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of a patient manifesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> with the offending artery transfixing the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old woman was admitted with typical episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiograms revealed the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA) compressing the nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through a retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy on the right side, the right SCA was found to compress the root entry zone (REZ) and then penetrate the portio major of the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nerve was dissected parallel to the axis, 7 mm distally from the transfixing point to facilitate transposition of the SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to anchoring the distal portion of the SCA to the tentrium, a prosthesis was interposed between the proximal portion and the pons to secure the decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pain was completely relieved immediately after operation with no neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedures, such as the longitudinal rhizotomy employed in this case, must be carried out for microcompression, in response to individual anatomical variations in neurovascular structures </plain></SENT>
