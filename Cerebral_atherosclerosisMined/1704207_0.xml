<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the afferent innervation were manifested in the increased sinuosity of fibers, areas of hyper- and hypoimpregnation, appearance of thickenings in the fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in the vasomotor innervation consisted of the disturbances of the nerve network structure, an increase of nerve fibers concentration and varicosity in the cholinergic plexuses and their decrease in the adrenergic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restructurings of the nerve apparatus were more pronounced in the arteries of large caliber </plain></SENT>
