<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were subdivided in asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects, making a distinction in both subgroups between patients with (RF+) or without (RF-) major vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid lesions were present in 41% of asymptomatic RF- subjects; in 53% of asymptomatic RF+ subjects; in 53% of symptomatic RF- subjects and in 75% of symptomatic RF+ subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> increases along with age, being more frequent in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression model has then shown that increasing age, male gender, cigarette smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> are predictors of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has been proved to play significant role only in the age class 61-69 yr </plain></SENT>
