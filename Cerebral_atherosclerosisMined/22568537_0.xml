<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the parental artery produces similar single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> by blocking the orifice of branching arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to review the evolving concepts, clinical characteristics, and classification issues of single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease is an important cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e>, more so in the posterior than in anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is one of the major causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease seems to be common in Asian population where intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical characteristics of single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease are similar to single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> caused by small artery disease, single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease is more often associated with characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and fluctuating and poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With advanced imaging techniques such as high-resolution cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging, single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease emerges as an even more important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sub-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it has been neglected in previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sub-type classifications, being erroneously classified as small artery disease or cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevention and treatment trials focusing on single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease is an important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sub-type, distinct from small artery disease, illustrating that greater efforts should be made in its accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies are needed to investigate the prevalence of single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease in various parts of the world and to design a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> classification system that includes single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> associated with parental artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prevention and treatment trials should consider this important sub-group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, so that tailored strategies can be applied in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
