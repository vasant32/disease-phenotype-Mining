<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The atherosclerotic process begins during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> phase characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin can substantially alter the structure and function of the arterial wall and affect the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a cross-sectional study of the relation of arterial stiffness indexes with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and serum insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several indexes of common carotid artery stiffness were assessed with noninvasive ultrasound methods in a biracial sample of 4701 men and women 45 to 64 years of age in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial compliance (AC), stiffness index (SI), pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), and Young's elastic modulus (YEM) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>YEM includes wall (intima-media) thickness and thus gives an estimate of arterial stiffness controlling for wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> indexes of arterial stiffness were higher with increasing concentrations of fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent in both black and white examines and in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 25% increase in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (approximately 1 SD) was associated in nondiabetic white men with a 5.8% (95% CI, -9.6% to -1.9%; P = .004) decrease in AC and increases of 5.8% (95% CI, 2.0% to 9.7%; P = .002) in SI, 11.3% (95% CI, 6.9% to 15.9%; P &lt; .001) in Ep, and 11.2% (95% CI, 6.2% to 16.6%; P &lt; .001) in YEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In nondiabetic white women, the corresponding predicted changes were a decrease of 15.0% (95% CI, -18.2% to -11.7%; P &lt; .001) in AC and increases of 16.6% (95% CI, 12.5% to 20.8%; P &lt; .001) in SI, 23.2% (95% CI, 18.4% to 28.2%; P &lt; .001) in Ep, and 19.2% (95% CI, 14.0% to 24.7%; P &lt; .001) in YEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> and insulin contributed synergistically to the increase in stiffness indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Insulin and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> also had a synergistic association with stiffness indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are compatible with the view that persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> or borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> have stiffer arteries than their counterparts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and that the decreased elasticity is independent of artery wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The joint effect of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> can have a considerable impact on arterial stiffness and play an important role in the early pathophysiology of macrovascular disease in <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
