<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to evaluate the proportion of European hospitals where imaging techniques necessary to detect intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method- We randomly selected 886 hospitals in 25 countries and classified them in 3 categories according to the availability of 3 imaging techniques (transcranial color-coded duplex imaging, computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography): "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>" when the 3 techniques were available, "at least 1," and "none." We compared the proportion of hospitals meeting these criteria, using the odds ratio method and Germany as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-two hospitals (30.7%) met criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 445 (50.2%) met criteria for at least 1, and 169 (19.1%) met criteria for none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2005, they had admitted, respectively, 139,118, 160, 393, and 62 667 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain CT or MRI were available in 820 (92.6%) hospitals, computed tomographic angiography in 619 (69.9%), magnetic resonance angiography in 498 (56.2%), and transcranial color-coded duplex in 352 (39.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to Germany, Greece (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.88), Iberic countries (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05-0.27), Baltic countries (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.56), Poland (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77), and France (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.89), had significantly less hospitals in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Europe, less than one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients are admitted in hospitals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imaging techniques available to detect intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are important differences between countries </plain></SENT>
