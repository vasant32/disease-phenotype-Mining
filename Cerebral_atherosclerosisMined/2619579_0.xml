<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMF were, in half of the cases, the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which was mistakingly considered a complication of the arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or rupture of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the brain base arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, MMF were either latent or manifested as recurrent disturbances of the brain circulation of the ischemic or (more frequently) haemorrhagic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When clinically manifested MMF were revealed at the age of 15-32 years; at the age of 65-74 years they were found incidentally at the autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their predominant localization was in the brain stem, contiguous ventricular wall and in the cerebellum with its tunic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following histological types can be distinguished: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, venous, cavernous, arteriovenous, nonclassified, varicosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinico-anatomical characterization of each type is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The medico-legal importance of MMF and the principal possibility of their treatment (when duly diagnosed) is pointed out </plain></SENT>
