<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence and incidence of ABI and the association of risk factors with new ABI were investigated in 201 Hispanic men, mean age 79 +/- 8 years, and in 302 Hispanic women, mean age 80 +/- 9 years, in a long-term health care facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 42 +/- 20 months in men and 47 +/- 26 months in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of prior ABI was 33% in Hispanic men and 30% in Hispanic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new ABI was 24% in Hispanic men and 23% in Hispanic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant independent risk factors for new ABI were age (risk ratio = 1.09 in men and 1.08 in women for each increase of 1 year of age), current cigarette smoking (risk ratio = 2.8 in men and 2.7 in women), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (risk ratio = 2.8 in men), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (risk ratio = 3.5 in men and 5.0 in women), prior ABI (risk ratio = 5.6 in men and 5.5 in women), serum total cholesterol (risk ratio = 1.03 in men and 1.01 in women for each 1 mg/dl increase), and serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol (risk ratio = 1.06 in men and 1.06 in women for each 1 mg/dl decrease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant independent risk factors for new ABI were age, current cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, prior ABI, serum total cholesterol, and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (inverse association) in older Hispanic men and women and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in older Hispanic men </plain></SENT>
