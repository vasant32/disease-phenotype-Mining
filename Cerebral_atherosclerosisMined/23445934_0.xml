<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal was to explore the features and cerebral basis of "radiation" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> in the survivors of the Chernobyl accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects and Methods The cross-sectional study included 241 people, 219 of whom have been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 4th ed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) criteria, among them 115 clean-up workers of the Chernobyl accident (34 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> radiation sickness), 76 evacuees from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, 28 veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 22 healthy unexposed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: "Radiation" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> includes "flashforward" phenomena and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037650" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">somatoform disorders</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, trait and state <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>); and neurocognitive deficit (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired memory</z:e> and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference, cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intima-media component, thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>arteries stenosis</z:mp> rates are increased in the liquidators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power, together with an increase of alpha-power, were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> following radiation emergency is characterized by comorbidity of psychopathology, neurocognitive deficit, and cerebrovascular pathology with increased risk of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral basis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> is proposed to be an abnormal communication between the pyramidal cells of the neocortex and the hippocampus, and deep brain structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that a system of emergency and long-term psychological and psychiatric care be organized for the survivors in Fukushima Daichi, Japan </plain></SENT>
