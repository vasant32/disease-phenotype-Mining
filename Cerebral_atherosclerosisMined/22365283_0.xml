<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to investigate 1-year atherothrombotic vascular event rates and to assess the risk factors for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted between January 2007 and July 2009 at 313 hospitals in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outpatients who were at least 45 years of age and who had received oral antiplatelet therapy were enrolled within 2 weeks to 6 months from the last <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12 ± 3 months after enrollment, data on presence/absence of atherothrombotic vascular events were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the occurrence of fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3452 patients were enrolled, and 3411 patients who had baseline data were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-year event rate was 3.81% (95% confidence interval 3.15-4.48%) for fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 0.84% (95% confidence interval 0.52-1.15%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at least twice than in patients who had first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (5.02% vs 3.59%; P = .0313) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was significantly associated with age (P = .0033), the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = .0129), and waist circumference ≥80 cm (P = .0056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence than stable patients enrolled in the REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry even though they received antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rigorous management of risk factors is needed </plain></SENT>
