<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> status, as measured by dietary intake and plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> concentration, is related to mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> in people aged 65 and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 20 year follow up study of a cohort of randomly selected elderly people living in the community who had taken part in the 1973-4 Department of Health and Social Security nutritional survey and for whom dietary and other data had been recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eight areas in Britain (five in England, two in Scotland, and one in Wales) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 730 men and women who had completed a seven day dietary record and who had no history or symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> when examined by a geriatrician in 1973-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was highest in those with the lowest <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those in the highest third of the distribution of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> intake had a relative risk of 0.5 (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 0.8) compared with those in the lowest third, after adjustment for age, sex, and established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relation between <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was independent of social class and other dietary variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar gradient in risk was present for plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was found between <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> status and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In elderly people <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> concentration, whether measured by dietary intake or plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, is strongly related to subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but not from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
