<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study of 35 healthy subjects <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parameters of the spectrograms of the extracranial arteries were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 84 patients with ADE, ultrasound double scanning revealed stenoses and occlusions of the brachiocephalic arteries in 47 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were confirmed by AG and were classified into five categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the data demonstrated that the diagnostic reliability of UDS versus AG was 95.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UDS makes it possible to diagnose accurately occlusive lesions of the brachiocephalic arteries in patients with ADE and to determine indications for AG and thus may be used for screening purposes </plain></SENT>
