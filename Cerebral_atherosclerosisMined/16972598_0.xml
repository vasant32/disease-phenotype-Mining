<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complex study, including duplex ultrasonography, CT, measurement of cholesterol and its fractions, has been conducted in 85 patients with atherothrombotic (72 patients) and lacunar (23 patients) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of leucocytes' culture to accumulate and secrete cholesterol in vitro was studied as a nonspecific inflammatory marker of lesion of atherosclerotic MAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high level of this index was characteristic of atherothrombotic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> comparing to lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high levels of this index correlated with severity of atherosclerotic injury of MAH, in particular with plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of the index after 24-day therapy by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (vasilip) is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suppose that the protective influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may be caused by the effects on the level of immune competent cells including reducing leucocytes ability to accumulate and secrete protein-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
