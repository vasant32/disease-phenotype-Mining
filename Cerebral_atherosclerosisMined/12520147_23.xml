<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A link between certain infectious microorganisms and an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the data of subjects who had undergone general health-screening tests, a possible association between carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and seropositivity of antibody against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) has been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a possible link between carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and HCV core protein positivity was assessed, because it is postulated to be a better marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> and thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 1992 enrolled subjects, 496 (25%) had carotid artery plaque, and 25 (1.3%) were positive for HCV core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery plaque was positive in 480/1967 (24%) and 16/25 (64%) of the core protein-negative and core protein-positive subjects, respectively (p&lt;0.0001 by chi(2) test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of transaminases were higher in core protein-positive subjects, but albumin concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HCV core protein positivity is an independent predictor of carotid plaque with an odds ratio of 5.61 (95% confidence interval 2.06-15.26, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data further support the possible link between persistent HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the subjects without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
