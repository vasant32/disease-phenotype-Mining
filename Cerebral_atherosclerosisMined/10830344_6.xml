<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A preliminary national survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the young (15-45 years) undertaken by the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Consortium indicated that in 44% of 356 patients, no cause was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the reason for this high incidence of diagnostic uncertainty in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neurologists in the ten Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers completed a detailed questionnaire for patients aged 15-45 years admitted to hospital between January 1993 and December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a stepwise diagnostic algorithm incorporating clinical, neuroimaging, neurovascular and laboratory data, we divided patients into three groups: (1) those with established cause for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, (2) those who remained unexplained despite adequate investigation, (3) those who remained unexplained but were, in our opinion, under-investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 197 patients (56%), an identified cause was established including cardioembolic sources (14%), extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> (13%), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A miscellaneous group of 15%, included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 159 patients (44%) with no apparent cause for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we considered only 81 (23%) adequately investigated, and 78 (21%) inadequately investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About one in five young patients was inadequately investigated by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-oriented group of neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major problem appears to be restriction of investigations to neuroimaging alone (usually computerized cerebral tomography), without further tests such as cerebral angiography and cardiac imaging </plain></SENT>
