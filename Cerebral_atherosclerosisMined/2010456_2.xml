<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared the results of duplex scanning (DS) with contrast angiography (CAN) in the evaluation of 119 patients whose 238 carotid arteries were evaluated by both methods within a four-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were then categorized by two different definitions of severity of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Category A classified 1-29% stenosis as mild, 30-69% stenosis as moderate, and 70-99% diameter reduction as severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Category B defined mild stenosis as 1-19% lumen diameter reduction, moderate as 20-49% stenosis, and severe as 50-99% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings by each classification were compared in 60 patients with hemispheric symptoms and in 59 patients with nonspecific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAN was our "gold standard", and exhibited greater sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries with 70% stenosis were identified by DS with greater specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than were arteries with 50% stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the sensitivity was comparable in categorizations A and B (80% and 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters of measurement were superior in patients with hemispheric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DS alone cannot substitute for CAN in selecting patients for carotid endarterectomy because its error rate exceeded acceptable rates of complications for carotid artery surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The false positive rate of DS was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DS failed to diagnose 7 of 19 carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, 9 of 11 ulcerated plaques, 7 of 119 instances of aortic arch disease, and 13 cases of severe intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
