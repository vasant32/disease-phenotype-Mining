<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in the platelet activity was found in ischaemic insult, manifesting itself by the occurrence of spontaneous aggregationin 60% of the cases, an acceleration of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation, and the second aggregation phase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation was revealed between the secondary aggregation and the intensity of spontaneous and of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation, and the possibility of a transformation of the spontaneous into the secondary aggregation of platelets was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic insults were characterized by the absence of spontaneous and secondary aggregation and by the suppression of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a transient insult, the mean values of the aggregatogram items did differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the role of increased permeability of platelet membranes in the mechanism triggering off spontaneous aggregation and the second phase of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced aggregation was documented </plain></SENT>
