<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of them had been diagnosed correctly during the life of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The material was divided into three groups: I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>22 cases with very dramatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> suggesting in neurological appearance injury to the hemispheres, leading in most cases (15 out of 22) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>18 cases in which the survival was from 2 months to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vasogenic damage to the brain stem preceded considerably the development of brain softening or supratentorial haemorrhage 12 cases, in 7 cases the brain stem lesion was clinically silent in neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fresh infarctions (group I) in the brain stem were located usually in the region of vascularization of the short circumferential and paramedian arteries, mainly in the basal part of the pons and midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group II single or multiple cavities were situated unilaterally or bilaterally mainly in the pons, at the watershed of the vascularization areas of paramedial and short or long circumflex arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The foci in the brain stem were associated in most cases (32 out of 40) with vascular lesions in the remaining areas of the same vascularization region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the discussion on the pathogenesis the significance of degenerative changes in the walls of the vessels in this region and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in them for the development of necrotic changes has been stressed </plain></SENT>
