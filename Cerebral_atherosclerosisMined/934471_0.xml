<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were examined for hemispherical rCBF determination on the same occasion, using the 133Xenon clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primarily, the patients were examined without general anaesthesia, and they did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness, trauma, or angiographic evidence of a focal intracranial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, other parameters such as arterial size, ventricular size, cerebral circulation time, age, and sex were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these data were studied statistically in a series of multiple regression analyses with a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in rCBF could be found between cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and without any kind of vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the mean value of rCBF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and in patients with intracranial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> was below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean value, although it did not differ significantly from this value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nor was any influence on the rCBF found in patients with marked stenosis of the internal carotid artery and those with slight stenosis </plain></SENT>
