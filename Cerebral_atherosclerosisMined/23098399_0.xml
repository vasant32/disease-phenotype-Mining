<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included into this study 80 patients with multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed parameters of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> composition, data of cerebral oxymetry, echocardiography, and central hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found gender linked differences in structural-functional parameters of myocardium and in mechanisms of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> which increased with increase of excess body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with differences in oxygen brain supply between men and women </plain></SENT>
