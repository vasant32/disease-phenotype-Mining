<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication is the symptomatic patient (Stage II) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ACI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data of several studies have yielded a highly restrictive policy toward operative procedures in asymptomatic patients (Stage I) with carotid bruit or ACI-stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore there emerged wide consensus, that patients with frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Stage III) should not be operated upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As diagnostic procedures highly advanced non invasive procedures came up during the last decade, as well as computerized tomography and digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative procedure is performed in general anesthesia with controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during the clamping period (n = 650) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative results without using a shunt are not different to those with a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the last 5 year period our results yielded a 1% perioperative central permanent neurological deficit rate (CPNDR) and a 1% operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a 51 months median observation period 1.5% presented again with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>-with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>; 0.6% developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2.2% deceased by cerebral complications yielding at totally 4.3% long term complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual rates are 0.3%, 0.1% respectively 0.5%, totally 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion CAE can be offered as a safe surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> preventing procedure in symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients with ACI stenoses in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perioperative as well as long term results are yielding a high standard and are clearly better than those without operation </plain></SENT>
