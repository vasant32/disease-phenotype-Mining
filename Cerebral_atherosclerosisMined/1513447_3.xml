<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rare but potentially lethal complication of this technique is <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>aseptic necrosis</z:hpo> and rupture of the vein patch during the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three cases of this phenomenon and review an additional 13 cases from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This event generally occurs without warning 2 to 7 days postoperatively and may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At reoperation, the central portion of the vein patch is necrotic, without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technical considerations in the harvesting and preparation of these grafts are reviewed, as are the physical parameters predisposing certain vein patches to rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saphenous vein harvested from the ankle has been linked to every reported case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small diameter veins in particular appear to carry a higher risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
