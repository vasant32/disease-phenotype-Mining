<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autocorrelation analysis of the results revealed the existence of spontaneous ultradian cycles of recurrence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the frequency and amplitude of which discriminated the healthy subjects and only non-organically sick patients from patients with organic neurological deficits. 'Scatter' scores representing deviations about the mean tapping scores showed similar cyclic characteristics </plain></SENT>
