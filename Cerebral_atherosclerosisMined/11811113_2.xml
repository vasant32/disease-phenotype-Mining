<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A double blind placebo-controlled trial examined allicor effects on hemostasis and fibrinolysis in cross-over groups at two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the first stage patients of group 1 (n = 15) received allicor in a dose 600 mg/day; patients of group 2 (n = 14) were given placebo </plain></SENT>
