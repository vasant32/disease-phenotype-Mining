<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 137 patients had some degree of CAA in one or more brain regions although the occipital cortex was severely affected by CAA more frequently, and consequently mean CAA severity score was significantly greater, than other cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients (63.5%) were affected by ML, with more patients showing ML from occipital cortex than from other cortical regions leading to a significantly higher mean ML severity score in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-six patients (92%) were affected by ART, although the occipital cortex was not more frequently affected by ART than other cortical areas, the mean ART severity score in occipital cortex was nonetheless significantly greater than that of frontal and temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients showed both CAA and ML, although there was only a weak correlation between degree of CAA and extent of ML (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients showed ML and significant ART, 16 patients showed significant ART but no ML, 40 patients showed ML in the absence of significant ART and 34 patients showed neither significant ART nor ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, and for each of the four brain regions, the extent of ML correlated significantly (P &lt; 0.001) with degree of ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when only those 47 patients with ML and significant ART were considered, much stronger correlations between the extent of ML and the degree of ART were achieved both overall and within each of the four brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall ART severity score (and overall scores for each pathological marker of ART) significantly correlated with that of CAA (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathological processes leading to white matter damage, in terms of ML at least, in AD are thus likely to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many patients suffer ML in association with ART, but in others ML cannot be explained by presence of ART or CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In such patients, autoregulatory changes in blood vessels might be responsible for ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between the extent of CAA and ART suggests shared risk factors for each pathological change </plain></SENT>
