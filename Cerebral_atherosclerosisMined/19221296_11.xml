<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Conventional arterial imaging focuses on the vessel lumen but lacks specificity because different pathologies produce similar <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wall imaging can characterize extracranial arterial pathology, but imaging intracranial walls has been limited by resolution and signal constraints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Higher-field scanners may improve visualization of these smaller vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-tesla contrast-enhanced MRI was used to study the intracranial arteries from a consecutive series of patients at a tertiary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiplanar T2-weighted fast spin echo and multiplanar T1 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery precontrast and postcontrast images were acquired in 37 patients with focal neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnoses included atherosclerotic disease (13), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (3), dissections (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> (2), cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> (1), extracranial source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5), and no definitive clinical diagnosis (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 13 with atherosclerotic disease had focal, eccentric vessel wall enhancement, 10 of whom had enhancement only in the vessel supplying the area of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> had diffuse, concentric vessel wall enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of 3 with dissection showed bright signal on T1, and 2 had irregular wall enhancement with a flap and dual lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-tesla contrast-enhanced MRI can be used to study the wall of intracranial blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T2 and precontrast and postcontrast T1 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images at 3 tesla may be able to differentiate enhancement patterns of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques (eccentric), <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (concentric), and other wall pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of arterial wall imaging for distinguishing the range of pathologic conditions affecting cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
