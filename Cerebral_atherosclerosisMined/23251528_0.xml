<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) on prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial stenosis in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective cohort of 701 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, caused by intracranial stenosis, were followed at 3-month intervals for 1 year to monitor development of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed using magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined using International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MetS was identified in 26.0% of the cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with MetS were more likely to be female, nonsmokers, and more likely to have a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than patients without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 1-year follow-up, patients with MetS had a non-significantly higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (7.1%) than patients without MetS (3.9%; P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mortality (3.3% versus 3.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis (adjusting for gender, BMI, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) identified an association between that 1-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and the presence of MetS (hazard ratio 2.30; 95% CI: 1.01-5.22) and large waist circumference (hazard ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.05-5.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, multivariable analysis adjusting for the individual components of MetS found no significant associations between MetS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between these parameters and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> who have MetS, are at higher risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those without MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, MetS was not predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence beyond its individual components and one-year mortality </plain></SENT>
