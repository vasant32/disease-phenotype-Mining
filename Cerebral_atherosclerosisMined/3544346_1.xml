<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of 1,377 patients (7 Asians, 1 Black, 1 Caucasian) from the Cooperative Study of Extracranial/Intracranial Arterial Anastomosis were found to have atherosclerotic bilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) trunk before entering the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> followed by a contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, two experienced a unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, two had a unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> preceded by ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, one had a unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> on both sides and one experienced isolated unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrograde filling to the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was universally present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean: 45 months), only one (non-operated) patient had further cerebrovascular events, and ultimately a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One additional patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and one had a silent myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors resumed their previous activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows that in bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk occlusion, the long-term prognosis is reasonable in the patients who do not present with a devastating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
