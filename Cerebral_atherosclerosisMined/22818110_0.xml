<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate SIA prevalence among Caucasian patients hospitalized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (ACI) in a prospective, multicenter Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with ACI were prospectively evaluated with TCD over a 24-month-period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The previously validated criteria of SONIA trial were used for detection of &gt;50% intracranial stenosis with TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain angiography was performed to confirm the diagnosis in cases with abnormal TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SIA was diagnosed when there was evidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the territory of the stenotic artery (identified by TCD and confirmed by Magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]/Computed tomography angiography [CTA]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 467 consecutive patients with ACI (60.4% men, mean age 58 Â± 14 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIA was documented in 43 patients (9.2%; 95%CI: 6.9%-12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common SIA location was M1MCA (34.9%) followed by TICA (18.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR: 4.25, 95%CI: 2.18-8.26; P &lt; .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.02-5.67; P= .045) were independently associated with SIA on multivariate models adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SIA was identified in almost 10% of patients admitted with symptoms of ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings support further collaborative initiatives among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> physicians to increase the yield of SIA detection in Caucasian patients with ACI </plain></SENT>
