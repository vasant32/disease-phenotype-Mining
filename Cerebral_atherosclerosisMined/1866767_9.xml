<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
