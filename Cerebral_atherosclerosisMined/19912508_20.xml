<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In spite of the mounting interest in the nexus between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> (ED) and cardiovascular (CV) diseases, there is little published information on the role of ED as a predictor for subsequent CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study aimed to investigate the role of ED as a predictor for atherosclerotic CV events subsequent to the manifestation of ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigation involved the retrospective study of data on a cohort of men with ED linked to hospital morbidity data and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using the linked data, the incidence rates of atherosclerotic CV events subsequent to the manifestation of ED were estimated in men with ED and no atherosclerotic CV disease reported prior to the manifestation of ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of subsequent atherosclerotic CV events in men with ED was assessed by comparing these incidence rates with those in the general male population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Standardized incidence rate ratio (SIRR), comparing the incidence of atherosclerotic CV events subsequent to the manifestation of ED in a cohort of 1,660 men with ED to the incidence in the general male population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of hospital admissions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registrations, men with ED had a statistically significantly higher incidence of atherosclerotic CV events (SIRR 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.9, 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significantly increased incidence rate ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups younger than 70 years, with a statistically highly significant downward trend with increase of age (P &lt; 0.0001) across these age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger age at first manifestation of ED, cigarette smoking, presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic disadvantage were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with higher hazard ratios for subsequent atherosclerotic CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that ED is not only significantly associated with but is also strongly predictive of subsequent atherosclerotic CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is even more striking when ED presents at a younger age </plain></SENT>
