<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between Lp(a) level and the extent of intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2001 and August 2003, 166 consecutive first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had intracranial stenoses on transcranial Doppler, of which 100 fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of intracranial large-artery occlusive disease was assessed by the number of angiographically confirmed intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum Lp(a) was determined a minimum of 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one intracranial stenoses were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one (51%) patients had three or more stenoses (greater-extent group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest Lp(a) quartile had a higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a greater extent than those in the lowest quartile (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 11.33, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between Lp(a) concentration and the number of stenoses (r = 0.310, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Lp(a) level increased gradually with the number of stenoses (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression model identified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.57, p = 0.04) and high Lp(a) (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.18, p = 0.043) as independent markers of a greater extent of intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High Lp(a) level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are independent markers of a greater extent of intracranial large-artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for Lp(a) in intracranial stenotic atherogenesis and might be useful for the selection of high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
