<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted comparative studies on intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> over the past 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-year consecutive autopsy case studies from an urban geriatric hospital between 1974-1975 (Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>484 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1986-1987 (Group II, 504 cases) and 2000-2001 (Group III, 273 cases) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic changes of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries and basilar artery were semiquantitatively evaluated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3) and values of the 3 arteries were totalled to give a value of 0-9 which was taken as the intracranial atherosclerotic index (ICAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coronary stenotic index was calculated as previously reported (Sugiura et al 1969) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICAI and CSI were directly compared with each other, together with risk factors for each, including mean blood pressure (BP), serum level of total cholesterol (Tch) and the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chronologically ICAI decreased dramatically but CSI did not change at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was continuous lowering of BP, elevation of Tch and increased incidence of DM+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation in BP in relation to both ICAI and CSI (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DM+ vs. CSI (p &lt; 0.01) and ICAI (p &lt; 0.05), and Tch vs. CSI (p &lt; 0.01) but not ICAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis highlighted age and BP as major risk factors for ICAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study provides the first morphological confirmation of marked decrease of the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the recent 28 years, in contrast with unchanged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> in Japanese elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
