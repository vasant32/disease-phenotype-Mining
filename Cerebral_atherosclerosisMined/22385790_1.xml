<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>91% of the patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 31% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, 24% COPD, 18% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and 4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were cardiovascular decompensation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General autopsy revealed severe systemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 86 and 90%, respectively, renal angioangiolosclerosis in 82%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 65%, and other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathology showed average brain weight of 1,163 ± 113 g, mild to moderate brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, absent to mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of large cerebral arteries in 46%, mild, moderate and severe one in 31, 17, and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were considerable discrepancies in the severity between generalized/ aortic and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, only less than one-third being comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative Khachaturian criteria and CERAD Stage 0 were observed in 83 and 86%, respectively, only 13% with CERAD Stage A, and 1% Stage B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Braak neuritic stages ranged from 0 to II (53%), II - III (29%) to III - IV (18%), none scoring Grade V or VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average Braak score was 2.3 ± 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular pathologies were common; CAA was absent in 61%, mild or moderate in 36% and severe in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mild to severe lacunar state in basal ganglia and/or white matter was seen in 73%, hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in 3 cases, while only 9% were free of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> were observed in 5 brains involving substantia nigra (n = 3), cerebral cortex (n = 1) and medulla oblongata (n = 1), 1 case representing incidental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DLB">Lewy body disease</z:e>. τ pathology in brainstem was observed in 60 cases (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mixed cerebral pathologies (cerebrovascular lesions and moderate neuritic Braak stages) were observed in 6 cases (mean age 89.6 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The importance of mixed pathologies in nondemented elderly, being less frequent than in other studies, remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
