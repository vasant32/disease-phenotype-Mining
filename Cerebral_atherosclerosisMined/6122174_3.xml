<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms were ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 12 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 41, 9 of whom died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from other vascular territory in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine percent of the patients had preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of follow up (mean 48 months), only 2 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the occluded side were found </plain></SENT>
