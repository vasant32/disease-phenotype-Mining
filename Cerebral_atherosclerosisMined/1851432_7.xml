<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prolonged testing of marine fish oil (FO) as a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> is necessary because of widespread claims that it is antiatherogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis for such claims is inadequate because atherogenesis is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and may not respond to short-term changes induced by dietary treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A proven (vervet) model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> promoted by an atherogenic diet (AD) was used to test dietary supplementation with Atlantic pilchard FO for 20 months in 47 omnivorous nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were controlled against known favorable effects of changing from the AD to a therapeutic diet (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compliance was achieved, and tissue responses to the FO dose were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compromise of reflex vasoconstriction by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was demonstrated for the first time in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic, peripheral, coronary, and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were assessed by light microscopy and computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No component of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> regressed after dietary FO, and several deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a change to the TD, stainable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> was cleared from aortas and there were few lipophages, but advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male vervets developed more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> than did females, and the association among aortic, peripheral, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was positive in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Females were resistant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only mild cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the FO used was not antiatherogenic in the model, and there is a need for caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The TD regresses some components of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but it was not effective against <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, mineralization, and cholesterol crystals within 20 months </plain></SENT>
