<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of a representative sample of Greek adults (n = 4153), men and women (49% and 51%, respectively), living in urban, semi-urban and rural areas (54%, 25% and 21%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III definition of the MetSyn was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of the MetSyn was 23.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.4%-25.1%]; this was similar in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fully adjusted prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in those with the MetSyn (n = 984) was 29.4%, significantly higher than in those without (n = 3169, 9.6%, p &lt; 0.0001), while subjects without both the MetSyn and DM had the lowest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> prevalence (n = 3035, 8.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with the MetSyn but no DM (n = 674) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> prevalence of 24.1% (p &lt; 0.0001 vs. those without the MetSyn), which was similar to that in subjects with DM without the MetSyn (n = 134, 25.4%), but lower than in those with both the MetSyn and DM (n = 310, 40.7%, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison to those without the MetSyn [odds ratio (OR) = 1], the ORs of prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, after multivariate analysis for age, sex and components of the MetSyn, and antiatherosclerotic drugs were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MetSyn = 1.94 (95% CI = 1.35-2.47), with both MetSyn and DM = 3.04 (95% CI = 1.98-4.11) and with MetSyn but no DM = 1.48 (95% CI = 1.12-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was markedly increased in the presence of the MetSyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with both the MetSyn and DM had the highest prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, followed by those with the MetSyn without DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probably MetSyn without DM should be considered as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>-risk equivalent in future guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This initiative would reset treatment targets and potentially provide additional benefit in patients with the MetSyn </plain></SENT>
