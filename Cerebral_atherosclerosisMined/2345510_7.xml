<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their experience with over 150 patients indicates that this examination may be performed in conjunction with standard spin-echo imaging with only a minimal increase in patient examination time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This combined examination is most applicable to atherosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> of the primary and secondary branches of the intracranial circulation (particularly in pediatric patients such as those following ECMO or with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>), and patients with saccular berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This type of static, angiographic technique adds little to standard spin-echo imaging in patients with arteriovenous fistulae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the present technique include the inability to visualize slow flow lesions (e.g., giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) and selected high flow states (arteriovenous fistulae, some severe stenoses) </plain></SENT>
