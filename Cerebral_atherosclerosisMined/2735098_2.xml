<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the elderly, a group of patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and a group of apparently healthy persons were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study also involved 48 patients with remaining manifestations of right- and left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unoccupied time interval and the interval occupied with performance of verbal tasks were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, interval durations were 45 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an underestimation of the unoccupied interval in the young group and it was overestimated by the elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the performance of verbal tasks, the age differences were insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occupied interval vs unoccupied interval was underestimated to a greater degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No sex differences were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time estimation in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> without focal disturbances was analogous to the pattern being observed in aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, underestimation of time and estimation accuracy exceeded similar indices in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship was established of the subjective time estimation with non-verbal intellect and several characteristics of brain asymmetry, but not with handedness </plain></SENT>
