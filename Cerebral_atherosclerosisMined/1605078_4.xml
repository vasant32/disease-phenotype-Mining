<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the developmental mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, the in vivo flow pattern around human cervical carotid bifurcations was studied by flow visualization using digital subtraction angiography with an isotonic contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood stream containing the medium impinged on the apex, then proceeded along the walls of the branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After opacification of the whole lumen around the apex, most of the medium was carried away, while some remained for a few seconds at the carotid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the internal carotid artery, the blood struck the wall at an oblique angle near the tops of the arterial curvatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases with atheromatous plaque or kinking of the branch, the blood passed through the stenosed segment and moved upstream, indicating turbulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that haemodynamic forces around the apex consist mainly of impingement on the apex and shear stress to the wall at and around the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In branches, high shear stress seems to exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It might be possible that high shear stress causes degenerative changes in the endothelial layer, initiating the formation of saccular and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
