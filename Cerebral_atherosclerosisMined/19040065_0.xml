<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HRMRI wasperformed with a 3.0 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanner on 5 patients with symptomatic middle cerebral (n = 3) or basilar (n = 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> of &gt; or = 70% confirmed by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Image diagnosis was made on the basis of HRMRI findings of vessel wall at the stenotic segment by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to patient's status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of the five patients were diagnosed to have advanced intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> based on the presence of a complex eccentric atherosclerotic plaque containing a large <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-rich necrotic core with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> post-contrast enhancement and with signs of ruptured fibrous cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other patients were likely to suffer from non-atherosclerotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRMRI revealed an iso-signal septum in the arterial lumen attaching to the slightly thickened arterial wall that was iso-signal with a homogeneous post-contrast enhancement in one patient and an obviously concentrically thickened arterial wall with hypo-intense signal on T1WI and slightly high signal on T2WI and PDWI and without any post-contrast enhancement in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In vivo HRMRI in patients with SSIS is technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It provides detailed information of intracranial arterial wall at the stenotic segment </plain></SENT>
