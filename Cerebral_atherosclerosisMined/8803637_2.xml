<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy in imaging of the extracranial arteries by using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), B-mode duplex ultrasonic examination (DUE) in comparison with the surgical and histological findings of the specimen removed after endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis of the arterial lumen of the surgical specimen was compared with the imaging findings of MRA, DSA and DUE: a) the degree of agreement of stenosis with histologic findings was found in 89% of cases for MRA, in 93% for DSA and 88% for DUE; b) the correlation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the plaque showed agreement in 91% of the cases with MRA, in 94% with DSA and 87% with DUE; c) the constitution of the plaque was in agreement with DUE findings in 96% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference between the three methods, as far as the estimation of degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the atheromatous plaque in the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA findings are similar with those of DSA and DUE with a high sensitivity and specificity concerning the constitution of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of MRA and DUE provides <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the necessary information concerning the extracranial segments of the cerebral arteries for the preoperative evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
