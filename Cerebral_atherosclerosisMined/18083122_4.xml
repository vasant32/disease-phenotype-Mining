<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein, a proinflammatory factor, is involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CRP 1059G&gt;C polymorphism appeared to be a susceptive marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of the distribution of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with triggered serum CRP concentrations following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (IS/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and CRP 1059G&gt;C polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 222 IS/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients (122 with only intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and 100 with isolated extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>) and 227 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra- and extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were determined by digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum CRP concentrations were measured by particle-enhanced immunonephelometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRP 1059G&gt;C genotypes were obtained through PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRP concentrations were significantly higher in intra- and extracranial groups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in CRP concentrations between intra- and extracranial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CRP 1059G&gt;C single-nucleotide polymorphism did not influence CRP serum concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CRP genotype and allele frequencies did not differ significantly between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of GC genotype and C allele were significantly higher in extracranial group than that in intracranial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The GC individuals showed a higher risk of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with GG individuals (OR 3.41; 95%CI, 1.124-10.347; P=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum CRP is associated with cerebral atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CRP 1059G&gt;C polymorphism is one possible genetic determinant for the difference between intra- and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
