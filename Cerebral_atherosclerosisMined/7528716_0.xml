<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each of them included 23 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients in the control group were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> but the ones in the treatment group were given the mixture of Zuzhongping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course of treatment was 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that there was a significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) in the score percentage, before and after treatment of neurological defects, between the control group and the treatment group, and the former (29.70 +/- 33.52) was much lower than the latter (45.40 +/- 27.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total curative rate of the treatment group (87.0%, 20/23) was significantly higher than that of the control group (60.9%, 14/23) </plain></SENT>
