<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was characterized both by their increase (even up to the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) and by their regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No evolution of the stenoses occurred when EICMA failed to function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The character of evolution of the stenosis was determined by its localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trend of the evolution was dependent on the etiology of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of EICMA functioning differed and was determined by the character of stenosis evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the development of stenosis into <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the neurological symptom complex was characterized both by marked augmentation followed by regression as well as by the absence of any changes or positive dynamics of the neurological changes </plain></SENT>
