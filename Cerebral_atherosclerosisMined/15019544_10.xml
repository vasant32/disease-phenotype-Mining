<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Okinawa has the highest longevity in Japan and a low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated carotid atherosclerotic (CA) risk factors in islands of I city in Okinawa prefecture and compared them with K town, a suburban area of Fukuoka prefecture in Kyushu, to determine the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in 1078 I city residents (375 men, mean age 63.7 and 703 women, mean age 60.0) in 2000 and 2364 K town residents (676 men, mean age 57.1 and 1688 women, mean age 53.0) in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed by mean intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) by B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly lower in the residents of I city than in those of K town (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>) levels and smoking rate were also lower in I city than in K town </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) level were higher in I city than in K town </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In I city, multiple regression analysis found independent relationships between carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and age, sex (male), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> is probably related to a lower lifetime burden of atherosclerotic risk factors, which may in turn be related to the longevity of Okinawa residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMI was not a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e>, although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was a common important risk factor </plain></SENT>
