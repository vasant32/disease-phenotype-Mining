<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upper cervical sympathectomy clearly reduced the susceptibility to vascular fat deposition in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of SHR and WKR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, denervated and intact RHR showed no significant difference in the susceptibility to vascular fat deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility and degree of the denervation effect were dependent on differences among the strains of SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the important role of neural factors and genetic disposition, in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, in the initiation of cerebrovascular atherogenesis in rats </plain></SENT>
