<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-one carotid bifurcations in 73 symptomatic patients were prospectively studied with high-resolution, B-mode sonography (HRS) and continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound (CWD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three bifurcations were studied because of asymptomatic bruits, 30 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and 36 for focal or nonfocal symptoms or signs suggesting occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 42 bifurcations were asymptomatic, with symptoms or signs confined to the contralateral bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings in the common, external, and internal carotid arteries (total, 393 vessels) were tabulated separately for plaque severity (HRS), ulceration (HRS), and degree of occlusion (HRS and CWD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRS correctly estimated plaque severity in 67% of vessels, with 13% overestimated and 20% underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRS was only 44% sensitive for detection of 81 angiographically demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 187 occlusive lesions (ranges, less than 50%, greater than or equal to 50%, less than 70%, greater than or equal to 70% decrease in diameter or complete occlusion) HRS correctly estimated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing in 62%, CWD in 30%, and HRS plus CWD in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among greater than 50% occlusive lesions, HRS was correct in 48%, CWD in 59%, and HRS plus CWD in 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (a) HRS is not accurate for diagnosis of ulceration, (b) Doppler and B-mode combined are more accurate than separate use of either procedure for evaluation of occlusive lesions, and (c) the level of accuracy in evaluating plaque and stenosis provides a general estimation of severity of disease but does not allow for precise diagnosis </plain></SENT>
