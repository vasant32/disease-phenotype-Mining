<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical significance of subclinical rhythmic EEG discharge of adults' (SREDA) by analyzing characteristics of SREDA and the outcome of patients based on retrospective analysis of EEG data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EEGs were recorded soon after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of patient's initial symptoms and repeatedly recorded at various intervals of 2-3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological findings, MRI and SPECT were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Out of 340 consecutive inpatient population who had EEGs, 4 patients (1.2%) showed SREDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, generalized tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> for each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no consistent abnormality in the brain MRI, CT or SPECT among the 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and transient symptoms disappeared and did not recur within the follow-up period of 28 months in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients SREDA disappeared in the follow-up EEG taken 7-14 days after the first EEG showing SREDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other 2 patients, the follow-up EEGs taken 5 days after the first EEG with SREDA when clinical symptoms disappeared showed less frequent occurrence of SREDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Being different from the previous reports suggesting the relation with cardiogenic insults or persistent ischemic abnormality, SREDA can occur in patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunctions</z:e> followed by a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
