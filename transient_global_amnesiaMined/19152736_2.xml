<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies, on the basis of transient focal high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), suggest involvement of memory circuits in the temporo-mesial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of a total of 65 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> between May 2004 and May 2008, we retrospectively analysed 21 in whom a DWI sequence was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed a focal hippocampal signal alteration both on DWI and on conventional T2; this alteration was no longer detectable on follow-up MRI two months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of transient DWI and T2 alterations in the hippocampal formation suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> could have a multifactorial, non-vascular aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of local susceptibility to neuronal metabolic stress emerges as a likely hypothesis </plain></SENT>
