<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We encountered two cases of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (a 53-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cases showed no evidence of abnormal findings which caused the attack on examinations of CSF, EEG, brain CT, brain MRI and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examinations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> labeled <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and O2, were performed on 14 and 8 days after the attack in the female and male cases, respectively, and those disclosed decreased regional blood flow (CBF), increased oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and decreased oxygen metabolic ratio (CMRO2) in the bilateral medial temporal and occipital lobes, which were supplied by the bilateral posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET, performed on about one month after the attack, revealed normalized values of CBF, OER, CMRO2 in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> in our cases may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the bilateral posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
