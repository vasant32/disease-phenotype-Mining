<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently a causal relation between internal jugular vein valve incompetence (IJVVI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IJVVI is postulated to provoke a transient mesiotemporal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> by venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mechanism requires a patent venous pathway from the affected IJV through the transverse sinus, confluens, straight sinus (SS), vein of Galen into the basal vein of Rosenthal and the internal cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study IJVVI in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients in relation to the intracranial venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IJVVI was defined if a repeated Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) led to a retrograde jugular flow detected by extracranial duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-contrast venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) was performed to analyse intracranial drainage patterns of the SS in relation to the side of the IJVVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SS drainage was differentiated into three groups: predominantly right, left, and bilateral drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound studies were performed in 25 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and 85 age matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients underwent venous MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty eight per cent of patients and 33% of controls showed unilateral or bilateral IJVVI (p = 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 36% of patients a <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> preceding VM was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drainage pattern of SS and side of IJVVI corresponded in five of eight patients (63%) with VM and four of 12 patients without VM (33%, p = 0.0994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the significantly higher prevalence of IJVVI in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, no specific IJVVI related intracranial venous drainage patterns could be found to further support the hypothesis of a direct causal relation between IJVVI and <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
