<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have found a high frequency of small high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and accordingly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been proposed as an etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> lesions occur preferentially in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which is known to be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> underwent DWI both within 24 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus on the initial DWI underwent subsequent DWI and T2-weighted imaging in the coronal plane to precisely localize the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients had small high-signal abnormalities (with diameters of 1-3 mm) in the hippocampus unilaterally on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these patients had two lesions in one hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the 20 patients had lesions bilaterally in the hippocampus, 1 of whom had 3 bilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 25 lesions were identified: 5 in the hippocampal head, 19 in the body, and 1 in the tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had unilateral lesions on the left,11 patients had them on the right, and 3 patients had bilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, lesions associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were localized mostly to the lateral portion of the hippocampus, corresponding to CA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the ischemic etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, but the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
