<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> is a syndrome mainly characterised by an anterograde <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e>, which disappears in less than 24 hours without leaving any kind of sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its aetiopathogenesis is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic theory became important after hypoperfusion was observed in the mesial region of the temporal lobe using different imaging techniques, although recently the use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by other authors has not revealed these alterations in the cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report on a transcranial Doppler study carried out in a female patient during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, with no evidence of hemodynamic alterations or significant asymmetries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeating the test after clinical recovery offered values that were similar to those of the previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is posited that the basis of this process would not be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but instead to a mechanism enabling spreading neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> that is similar to that which takes place during a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with antiplatelet drugs would not, therefore, be recommended but calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> or beta blockers would be useful in preventing the clinical picture from being repeated </plain></SENT>
