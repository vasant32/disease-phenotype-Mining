<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient who displayed the classical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> was assessed during the episode and again 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the episode, she was administered a task that required the perceptual identification of fragmented pictures over a number of learning trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, after recovery from the episode, she was required to identify the same fragmented pictures together with a new set of pictures that she had never seen before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was significantly better at identifying the old pictures than the new pictures, in spite of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> for the period of the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matched control subjects who had never seen either set of pictures before, were also tested and performed at a similar level on the old and the new pictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings extend the clinical domain of implicit memory phenomena and parallel similar observations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> (Cave &amp; Squire, 1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide the first demonstration of a residual capacity for long-term perceptual priming during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode of apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856801" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">total loss of memory</z:e> </plain></SENT>
