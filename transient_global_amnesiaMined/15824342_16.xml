<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the fine structural integrity of the hippocampus in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) using high-resolution T2 reversed (T2R) MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed detailed structural analysis of the hippocampus in 15 patients who had recovered from an episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and 150 randomly recruited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers across the adult age spectrum using high-resolution T2R MRI obtained on a 3.0-T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 100 subjects, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, were similarly studied and served as disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of hippocampal cavities detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers increased with age but never exceeded 40%, whereas the incidence in disease control group was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were always unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cavities were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (100%), an incidence higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or disease controls (p &lt; 0.05; Ryan's multiple comparison test), and were bilateral in eight patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cavities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (99%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease controls (100%) were crescent shaped and &lt; or =2 mm in width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cavities in 14 of 15 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (93%) were considerably larger (&gt;3 mm in width), and five of the patients had giant cavities (&gt;5 mm in width) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the cavities in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> had a rounded shape and resembled pathologic cavities described in specimens of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-related CA1 <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> may not be a benign entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> within CA1 area of Lorente de No may represent its important sequel </plain></SENT>
