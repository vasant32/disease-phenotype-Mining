<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, head injury or cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological deficits except for recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined her cerebral blood flow(CBF) immediately during <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>(<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) by stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> enhanced CT scans(Xe-CT) and twice thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Xe-CT during the attack showed a significant diminution of regional blood flow from the right posterior temporal lobe to the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional MRI scans also had been performed serially but it could not detect the local ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesion was clearly divided and larger than those cases reported using PET, SPECT, and diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> happens suddenly, and recovery is immediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It becomes very difficult to study CBF during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However stable Xe-CT is capable of examining CBF easily, so we concluded that CBF examination by Xe-CT in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients would be helpful to reveal the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
