<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies noted persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> following an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) with standard tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To specify long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> in a group of patients selected with stringent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both retrograde and anterograde memory were investigated in 32 patients 13-67 months after a <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episode with original tasks encompassing retrograde semantic memory (academic, public and personal knowledge), retrograde episodic memory (autobiographical events) and anterograde episodic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had preserved academic and public knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological scores were obtained in personal verbal fluency for the two most recent periods, and patients produced less autobiographical events than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when they were provided time to detail, memories were as episodic as in controls regardless of their remoteness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anterograde episodic tasks revealed a mild but significant impairment of the capacity of re-living the condition of encoding, i.e. the moment at which words were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have suffered from an episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> manifest deficits of memory focused on the retrieval of both recent semantic information and episodic memories and especially the capacity of re-living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These deficits may not result from a deterioration of memory per se but rather from difficulties in accessing memories </plain></SENT>
