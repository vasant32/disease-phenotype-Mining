<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attempting to support the hypothesis that retrograde venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> causing cerebral venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, the authors used cranial three-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) to detect a possible intracranial retrograde venous flow in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency of abnormal venous signals on cranial three-dimensional TOF MRA was compared in 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients with the signals in 50 age- and gender-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients with abnormal venous signals, other examinations (cerebral digital subtraction angiography, upper extremity digital subtraction venography [DSV], and thoracic inlet MRI) were performed to elucidate the etiology of these abnormal intracranial venous flow patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal venous signals on three-dimensional TOF MRA were found in five (50%) of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and none of the control subjects (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compression leading to occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein by the sternum and aorta during regular breathing, as depicted by upper extremity DSV and thoracic inlet MRI, occurred consistently among these five <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients with abnormal venous signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde intracranial venous flow caused by left brachiocephalic vein occlusion was found only in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients may have an underlying impairment of cerebral venous outflow that increases their vulnerability to <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack </plain></SENT>
