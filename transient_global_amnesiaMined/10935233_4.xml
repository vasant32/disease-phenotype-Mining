<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a clinical condition in which the etiopathogenesis is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most generally accepted theory is of a vascular origin, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> have also been considered to possibly be the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To make a retrospective review of the risk factors, etiopathogenesis and clinical characteristics of 58 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The variables recorded were compared with those from two control groups: one of healthy individuals and one of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was 66.01 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk factors included: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (58.62%), dyslipemia (15.51%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (8.62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients the EEG showed weak bilateral frontotemporal interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral CT scans were done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and were found to be pathological in 23, with lacunar multinfarct the commonest abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, these were older (66.01 vs 72.94), smoked more (1.72% vs 12.06%) and a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was more frequent (8.62% vs 31.03%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences regarding dyslipemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of vascular risk factors was significantly higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that the etiopathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is probably a transient ischemic phenomenon triggered (or not) following an attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
