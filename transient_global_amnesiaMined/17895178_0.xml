<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1989 to 1995, we observed 28 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcome were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 13 men and 15 women with a mean age of 62 years (range, 39 to 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of amnesic attack ranged from 20 minutes to 24 hours (mean, 8 hours), with the majority (76%) of attacks lasting for 2 to 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 (32%) of the 28 patients, the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was triggered by a potential precipitating factor including bathing, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prominent symptom exhibited by patients during an attack was repetitive questioning, which occurred in 21 (75%) of the 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> was noted during or after the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalograms were obtained in 26 patients after experiencing <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, which showed nonspecific findings in 6 patients and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 21 patients who had cranial computed tomography scans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> was found in 5 (24%), focal infarction in 4 (19%), and the results were negative in 12 (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the predominant vascular risk factor (11 cases, 39%), then <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (7 cases, 25%), and smoking (3 cases, 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No vascular risk factor was found in 13 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was found in 5 patients (18%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 2 (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study largely confirms the demographic pattern, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients reported from the western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the cause is uncertain, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is a relatively benign entity </plain></SENT>
