<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are different hypotheses about its pathogenesis, including theories about a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e>, migrainous or ischaemic foundation or its being due to venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in the hippocampuses, although the cause remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the same way, many precipitating factors have been related to this disorder, including pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, changes in temperature, exercise, Valsalva manoeuvres, diagnostic testing, interventionism and long-distance flights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sexual intercourse has also been related to this condition, although how it can exert an influence is not known and few cases have been reported in the literature to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Six patients who suffered from signs and symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> that were clearly related to a sexual relationship, in whom both the neurological examination and the complementary tests that were performed were completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also gather the evidence in favour and against the association between intercourse and this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathophysiological mechanisms that link sexual intercourse with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> are unknown, the relation between them appears increasingly more often in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We draw attention to the need to take sexual activity into account as a possible precipitating factor in patients suffering from this disorder </plain></SENT>
