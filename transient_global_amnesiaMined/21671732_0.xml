<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If the anterograde dimension is known to be impaired in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, researchers have yet to investigate prospective memory (PM)--which involves remembering to perform an intended action at some point in the future--in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as executive functions are thought to be spared in this syndrome, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> provides an opportunity to examine the impact of a massive "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> on PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed 38 patients with a newly designed protocol that distinguished between the prospective (remembering to do something at the appropriate time) and retrospective (remembering what has to be done) components of PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated episodic memory with an anterograde memory task and assessed executive functions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and mood, as well as their links with PM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that PM is impaired during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, with a greater deficit for the retrospective component than for the prospective component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we highlighted a strong link between these two components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterograde episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> were correlated with retrospective component deficits in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients, although we were able to confirm that executive functions are globally spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We discuss this pattern of results within the theoretical framework of PM, putting forward new arguments in favor of the idea that PM deficits can occur mainly because of a massive anterograde <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical consequences of PM impairment in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> are examined </plain></SENT>
