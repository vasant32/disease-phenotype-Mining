<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Ten patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and 11 control subjects were assessed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and after recovery 7 to 19 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both recollection and familiarity were impaired in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and showed significant, albeit not complete, recovery by the time of the postacute assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients did, however, show a significant levels-of-processing effect, which was significantly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, but not at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant levels-of-processing effect during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> might be linked to recruitment of the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
