<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her clinical and neuropsychological profiles were indistinguishable from those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between head trauma and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, perhaps as the result of a very stressful situation such as a car crash </plain></SENT>
