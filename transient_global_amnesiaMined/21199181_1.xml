<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hippocampal sulcal cavities (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) have been speculated to contribute to a higher vulnerability of memory pathways and might be a possible etiological factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the influence of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> on cognitive long-term outcome in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen otherwise healthy patients with the clinical syndrome of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> in their history underwent a high-resolution magnetic resolution imaging and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological control group consisted of 15 healthy subjects and was balanced for age, sex and other risk factors as well as intellectual and social status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnetic resolution imaging and neuropsychological testing have been performed 1128 days (median) after the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> have been detected in nine of the 14 patients and have been bilateral in eight of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in cognitive performance in patients with and without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> as well as compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even in patients with greater lesion load, only a slight visuospatial deficit was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although an increased incidence of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> is detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients, cavities are not obligatorily in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, even patients with hippocampal cavities achieve a full neuropsychological recovery independent of the frequency and size of the hippocampal lesions </plain></SENT>
