<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient group's performance was, however, significantly worse than that of the control's on measures of verbal memory notably immediate, 30-minute and 24-hour delayed paragraph recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, tests of public and personal remote memory revealed significant impairment of naming and recognition of famous faces, and of dating famous events without evidence of a temporal gradient, and impairment of cued recall of autobiographical memories on the Modified Crovitz Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that following <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> there is persistent, albeit mild, hippocampal-diencephalic dysfunction which appears to involve left-sided structures preferentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This impairment probably results from the attack, although a pre-existent deficit cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
