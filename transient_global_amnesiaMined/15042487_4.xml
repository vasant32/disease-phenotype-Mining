<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> care in Germany has substantially improved during the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One column of modern <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care is the institution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit which allows rapid diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aspect of admission of nonstroke patients to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit is poorly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the number of patients who are admitted to a national <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit but do not suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we related the proportion of nonstroke referrals to the different referral modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: Observational study recording <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> referrals with regard to final diagnosis and type of referral during a 12-month period (1.8.2002-31.7.2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 462 patients were admitted by 4 routes: 74 by paramedics or by self-presentation, 138 by emergency physicians, 144 by primary care doctors, and 106 were transferred from other hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>88 patients (19 %) finally revealed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common nonstroke diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (20 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012746" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dissociative disorders</z:e> (14 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial nerve disorders</z:e> (11 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (8 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference among the proportion of nonstroke patients referred by ambulance paramedics and self-presentation (15 %), emergency physicians (21 %), primary care doctors (15 %) and interhospital transfer (24 %) [p = 0.222, X (2)-test according to Pearson] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the fact that a number of clinical neurological conditions mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, misdiagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We advocate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients are seen early in the course of the disease by a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An alternative could be that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units of internal medicine hospitals patients are seen by a consulting neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, telemedicine might be used and the neurologist on duty of a neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit could be consulted </plain></SENT>
