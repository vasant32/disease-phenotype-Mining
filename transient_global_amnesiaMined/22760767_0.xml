<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a perfectly well defined clinical picture, but nevertheless even today its aetiology remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three most widely accepted theories suggest it has a vascular origin, it is related with the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> or it is of an epileptiform nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse whether there is an electroencephalographic pattern that is consistently repeated in a series of electro-encephalograms (EEG) carried out on patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consists in a retrospective analysis of a sample of 345 patients referred to have an EEG after an episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In almost 20% of the EEGs something that could be considered abnormal was found, although most of these findings (64%) were of little pathological significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 26%, attention should be drawn to the cases of two patients with subclinical rhythmic electroencephalogram discharges of adults (a pattern with a meaning that is not altogether clear and which has previously been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A considerable percentage of patients have <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and EEG alterations, although most of them are of scarce pathological significance or can be attributed to some other underlying condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have not succeeded in identifying any pattern that is consistently repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the EEG is a test with low diagnostic effectiveness in this pathology and it is necessary to reconsider the need to systematically perform such tests in suspected cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
