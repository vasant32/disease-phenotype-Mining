<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sibutramine (Meridia in the United States, Reductil in Europe) is approved for weight reduction and weight maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> is listed as a reported adverse event of sibutramine in the US product information, our literature search in the PubMed website database found no published reports of theses adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report a 39-year-old healthy woman who had an episode of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> lasting for several hours after taking sibutramine for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography of the head <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalogram showed spike and wave complexes with phase reversal in the left mesial temporal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> was suspected clinically and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273059" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">transient epileptic amnesia</z:e> provoked by sibutramine was also proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months after this episode, the follow-up electroencephalogram was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient did not take any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi>, and there were no more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This case serves to emphasize that sibutramine which was used for weight reduction might induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> or provoke <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273059" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">transient epileptic amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be careful to monitor for this adverse effect when sibutramine is prescribed </plain></SENT>
