<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient who was evaluated neuropsychologically and with single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) during and after an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the attack, there was patchy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> and an inability to learn both verbal and non-verbal material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed severe bitemporal hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial neuro-psychological testing documented a rapid recovery of recognition, but delayed recovery in reproduction of learned information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery of spontaneous verbal and figural fluency was even further delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow up SPECT examination showed a recovered cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case supports the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is associated with transient hypoperfusion of bilateral medial-temporal brain structures and suggests an additional involvement of structures responsible for drive and initiation </plain></SENT>
