<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical findings and neuropsychological profiles of a sample of patients exhibiting a focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> (FRA) seen consecutively during the period 1992-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cohort comprised 13 patients, five males, with a mean age of 30 years (range 16-49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were given a neurologic examination, psychiatric interview and formal neuropsychological examination (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one) during the amnesic phase, underwent neuroimaging, and were followed up for six months to ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> characterized by an impaired recollection of memories predating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event, with spared or minimally and transiently affected anterograde memory, thus consistent with FRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The events triggering FRA varied widely: mild to severe head injury, road accident without head injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020703" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dissociative fugue</z:e>, BDZ overdose, posttraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attack, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological hallmark of FRA was a selective or prominent impairment of autobiographical memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The defect was often so severe as to cover most or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients' lives and, in some cases, to erase the knowledge of their own identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional neuroimaging (brain CT and MRI) was unimpressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral SPECT/PET disclosed unilateral frontal hypoperfusion in three (two left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient fully recovered, time of recovery ranging from three days to six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FRA is a condition reflecting a block of memory function triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> events, including both physical and psychic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analogies shared with the more frequently encountered and better known condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> suggests common pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A tentative nosographic classification of FRA is finally offered </plain></SENT>
