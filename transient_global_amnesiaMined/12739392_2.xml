<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old right-handed man was suddenly unable to keep his recent memory without any event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological deficits except for recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbances</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He showed no causative findings of the attack on examinations of laboratory data, EEG and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT), using 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>, was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to detect bilateral hippocampal hypoperfusion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage using a new analyzing system, easy Z-score Imaging System (eZIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It showed extensive hypoperfusion also in the vertebrobasilar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven days later, these findings disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this system, we are able to evaluate cerebral blood flow objective with anatomical information by SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we concluded that this analyzing system would be helpful to reveal the pathophysiological mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
