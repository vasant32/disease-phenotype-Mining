<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one individual, with a left frontal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, had intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was multiple in 16 of the patients (34%), the attacks recurring with an average time span of one every 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> therapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were self-limited and rather benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 13 patients were known to be hypertensive and 2 had a history of classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average time span of EEG recordings after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was 2.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three individuals had recordings during the actual clinical attack, 2 of whom had paroxysmal abnormalities (one with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and the other with left temporal sharp wave and central spike and wave discharges) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had no change in the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> encountered was 36% (17 patients) but only 10.6% (5 patients) disclosed specific paroxysmal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation procedures, sleep and 24-hour ambulatory studies were overall of no additional value to the standard recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> seemingly represents a benign circulatory disturbance affecting the memory zones of the brain, rather than a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
