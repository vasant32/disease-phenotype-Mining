<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used fMRI to examine the activation patterns of patient AE during encoding and recognition of visual scenes during an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) and 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controls (n = 5) showed bilateral (R &gt; L) activation in parahippocampal and fusiform gyri during encoding and right-sided activation in the same regions associated with recognition of previously viewed scenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AE showed a similar pattern at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, when performance was profoundly impaired, AE showed no medial temporal activation associated with encoding of new scenes or recognition of old scenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both contrasts, the percent signal change in relevant medial temporal regions was more than three standard deviations below the control sample mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She did, however, show striking bilateral hippocampal activation for recognition attempts (old + new scenes &gt; baseline) even though retrieval was unsuccessful (55% recognition accuracy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was unique to AE on this occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to document normalization of both encoding and recognition activation patterns in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the strong hippocampal activation during unsuccessful retrieval highlights important issues in interpreting memory-related activations, particularly in dysfunctional systems </plain></SENT>
