<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously observed a high frequency of psychopathological features in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at assessing differences in risk factor profile and prognosis between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients with a focus on aspects with possible psychopathological relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 51 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients (mean age +/- SD, 62.7 +/- 6.7 years; M/F = 24/27) and 51 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (mean age +/- SD, 63.8 +/- 6.7 years; M/F = 41/10) and followed them up for about 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> controls, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients more frequently had a history of psychiatric diseases (age and sex-corrected OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.01-8.05) and alcohol use (OR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.10-9.66) and less frequently a history of cardiac (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.11-0.76) or peripheral artery disease (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A family history of psychiatric diseases was reported more frequently by <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients (OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.04-8.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients had a significantly lower risk of combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (log-rank test, P = 0.0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the dissimilar baseline risk factor profile explained most of the difference in prognosis between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> have more frequently a personal or family history of psychiatric diseases and a more favorable vascular risk factor profile and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results have therapeutic implications and reinforce the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is a benign disorder </plain></SENT>
