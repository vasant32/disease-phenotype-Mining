<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients underwent transcranial and carotid Doppler ultrasonography (including microembolus detection) and MRI within 24 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (including DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging and angio-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was repeated at 48 to 96 hours (21 patients) and 30 days (18 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Punctate DWI-L were observed in 16 patients (57%) and were not attributable to perfusion abnormalities, arterial stenoses or underlying cardioembolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRIs performed between 12 and 72 hours showed the highest frequency of DWI-L (88%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No pathological findings were observed at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is not related to cerebral arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
