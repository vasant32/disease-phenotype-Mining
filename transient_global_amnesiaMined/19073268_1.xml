<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is abnormal in patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient Global Amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained noninvasive rCBF measurements using Tc-99m-ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> diamer Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in 7 patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> within 4 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the amnestic episode while the patients were still symptomatic and in 17 age-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed memory functioning using the Hopkins's Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) and Statistical Parametric Mapping to compare rCBF across diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were significantly impaired in their performance on the 20-minute delayed recall of the HVLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also exhibited significantly decreased rCBF on their SPECT scans in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, with more prominent left-sided reductions in the superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri, as well as increased rCBF primarily in the right hemisphere within the middle temporal, superior temporal, and inferior frontal gyri, cerebellum, and thalamus, compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that lateralized abnormalities in brain functioning are an important component of the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lateralized abnormalities may disrupt functions that are relatively specific to the left hemisphere, including receptive language, symbolic representation, and the processing of local features in the environment, while preserving anterograde memory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased flow to the right hemisphere centered on regions that subserve the functions of expressive language and visuospatial processing, and may represent processes that compensate for flow reductions to the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
