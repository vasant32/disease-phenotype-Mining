<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several precipitating events have been proposed: physical exertion, emotional experiences, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper was to present two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> triggered by sexual intercourse and to suggest a possible mechanism for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both patients, clinical examination revealed elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations and brain CTs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG demonstrated diffuse dysrhythmia and slow spike-waves, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT revealed hypoperfusion in the left frontal and right medial temporal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Various explanations of the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the observed hypoperfusion in the medial temporal regions, a new hypothesis is advanced, suggesting the possibility that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> occurs due to a pathologically changed or less adaptable anterior chorioid artery, initially constricted by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> following a blood shift from the center towards periphery </plain></SENT>
