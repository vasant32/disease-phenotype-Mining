<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors performed Tc 99-m-bicisate brain single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi>-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning in a 66-year-old man during an episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, 24 hours after the episode and 3 months after the episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this is the only reported study in which a follow-up SPECT scan was performed within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial study showed bilateral mesial temporal lobe hypoperfusion that partially resolved after 24 hours and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resolution of the SPECT scan abnormalities correlated well with resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings agree with previously reported SPECT, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that indicate the mesial temporal lobe structures as the major site of pathology in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that a process causing decreased local metabolism, such as cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, constitutes the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in this case </plain></SENT>
