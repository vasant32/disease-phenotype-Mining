<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recorded auditory event-related potential (ERP) by using the standard oddball paradigm in seven amnestic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups according to brain CT or MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1) Three patients with no detectable lesion, including two patients studied during the episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, showed a well-defined P300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Three patients with detectable lesions in the mesial temporal lobes did not show any wave form corresponding to P300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two of these three patients, the ERP wave form showed a significant change in accordance with the improvement of MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) One patient who had a hypothalamic lesion due to total resection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> showed a low-amplitude P300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although neuropsychological examinations showed selective and severe impairment of recent memory function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients, no significant relationship was found between the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> and P300 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that P300 is more affected by existence and extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, especially in the mesial temporal lobes, rather than degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these results do not necessarily suggest that the potential generated in the mesial temporal lobes is directly recorded as a component of the scalp-recorded P300 </plain></SENT>
