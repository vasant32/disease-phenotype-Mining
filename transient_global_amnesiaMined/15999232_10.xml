<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a clinically well defined disorder, its etiology is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and subsequent damage to hippocampal and diencephalic structures are among the discussed hypothetical causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a direct method for the study of retrograde flow during a Valsalva maneuver, we determined whether jugular valve insufficiency contributes to cerebral venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Jugular valve closure was assessed by duplex sonography in 20 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and 20 age and gender matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of valvular insufficiency was made on the basis of recently established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valvular insufficiency (either left or right-sided, or bilateral) was identified in 85% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>,and in 45% of controls (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with involuntary Valsalva episodes immediately prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> developed valvular insufficiency (n = 8; p = 0.13 compared with patients who did not recall such an event) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the insufficiency jet did not differ significantly between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (3.26 s) and controls (2.78 s; p = 0.315) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> who experienced a trigger event were characterized by significantly longer insufficiency reflux times (3.84 s) than those without (2.55 s; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is associated with an increase in the prevalence of jugular insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Valvular insufficiency may lead to increased venous pressure transmission during a Valsalva maneuver and thus contribute to venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of valvular insufficiency and longer reflux times with the occurrence of a trigger event further suggests that cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> is an important etiological factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
