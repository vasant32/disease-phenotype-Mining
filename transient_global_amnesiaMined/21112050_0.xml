<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Currently, there is no consensus on the delay necessary to a complete recovery after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it seems that slight episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> extend beyond 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this impairment is probably a consequence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack, other factors such as patients' emotional state can intervene in the slow recovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a first experiment, we studied the dynamic of recovery processes after a <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assessed the anterograde and retrograde components of episodic memory in 19 patients one day, one month and one year after the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second experiment, we examined the impact of patients' emotional state on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e>, in using an original neuropsychological protocol (using material with emotional features) and an assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and depressive mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protocol was carried out in 19 other patients examined four months and one year after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first experiment, we highlighted mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> affecting the anterograde component of episodic memory one day after the episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, we showed these mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> could be detected several months after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients who had the more depressive tendencies recognized the fewer items and those who displayed the highest level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> supplied the fewer specific remote memories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that patients displayed very mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> several months after the episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, not affecting the daily routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This impairment was influenced by patients' emotional state, which could suggest that a high level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> can slow down the recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot be sure that the deleterious effect of patients' emotional state on their cognitive performances is specific to <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other investigations are necessary to unravel this issue </plain></SENT>
