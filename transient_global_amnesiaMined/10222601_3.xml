<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a syndrome characterized by an abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> and variable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e>, usually accompanied by repetitive query during the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients who were admitted to National Cheng Kung University Hospital during, or just after, their first transient amnesic episode between July, 1988, and December, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the details of the attacks, including time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, duration, activities upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, potential precipitating factors, behavior during attack, and accompanying neurologic signs or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also inquired about past medical history, current status and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients, 11 men and 14 women met the criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 27 to 77 years (mean, 60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of an attack ranged from one to 11.5 hours (mean, 6.3 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen attacks occurred in the morning and 10 had precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significant past history included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headache</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Investigation revealed abnormal cerebral computerized tomographic (CT) scans or magnetic resonance images in three patients (12%), abnormal cerebral single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) in six (86%) of seven performed within the first eight days, and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) in five patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The left temporal region was the most common site of dysfunction shown by EEG and cerebral SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three (12%) patients experienced a recurrent attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our patients had a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e>, and most had their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> attacks in the morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As compared with previously published studies, the results showed no differences with respect to age, duration of behaviour during attack, EEG, CT, family history and recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The exact duration of an attack is sometimes difficult to estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increasing case numbers over the years indicates the importance of the need for better education of medical residents regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
