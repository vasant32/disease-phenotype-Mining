<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is the inability to retain new information and to recall past events during a period of minutes or hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is unclear, and flow disturbances in the mesial temporal lobes secondary to venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> have been proposed as a potential cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic evaluation of the internal jugular vein (IJV) has demonstrated valvular insufficiency in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of valvular insufficiency in the IJV in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects without <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> of similar sex, age, and vascular risk factor profiles served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of 142 patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> within 7 days of the clinical event and 40 controls were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous Doppler examination of both IJVs was performed at baseline and after a manometer-controlled Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Valvular insufficiency was diagnosed when there was reflux for &gt;0.8 seconds during the Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valve insufficiency was found in at least one jugular vein in 113 of 142 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (79.5%) and in 10 of 40 controls (25.0%), P&lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The right side was affected more often than the left side, P&lt;0.01, and 26.8% of the patients had bilateral incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> have a high prevalence of IJV valve insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding may have pathophysiologic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Doppler evaluation of the IJVs with dynamic maneuvers may help in the evaluation of this usually benign condition </plain></SENT>
