<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is defined and described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristic features, epidemical data, variables possibly provoking <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, its possible etiology and anatomical basis are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transient disturbance in the formation of lasting new memories (usually of less than one day) and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> (which includes the period of the attack and possibly a short time before) are considered as the main features of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further trait of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is the high age of most of the patients subjected to it (58 years on the average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> most likely is based on a transient change in the blood supply of certain regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which this change happens is still hypothetical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regions of the limbic system, in particular the area of the temporal lobe and the hippocampal formation, appear to be affected most likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uncertain are: the existence of factors provoking the outbreak of an amnesic attack, the likeliness of multiple episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and the neuropsychological alterations in patients who suffered a transient global amnesic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcome of this review suggests, however, that the incidence of recurrent attacks of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is higher than previously assumed and that a transient global amnesic attack may be followed by lasting behavioral deteriorations </plain></SENT>
