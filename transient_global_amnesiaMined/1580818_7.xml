<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Independent of the interval between the procedure and the amnesic episode, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography demonstrated a decreased cerebral blood flow in the left temporal lobe in one patient and in the left parietotemporal region in three patients, with a more marked reduction in the temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A control single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic study was carried out in one patient 3 months after the amnesic attack and showed a left-sided persistent temporal hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in some patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> can be due to a vascular mechanism requiring strong investigations for vascular risk factors and appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up period of 12 to 32 months, none of the patients with regional hypoperfusion suffered cerebrovascular events, suggesting that single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography has no predictive value for further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
