<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient who suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) attack underwent regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) SPECT imaging and neuropsychological testing in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, after one month and after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase showed a pattern of anterograde and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e>, whereas memory was within age <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPECT data were analysed with a within subject comparison and also compared with those of a group of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within subject comparison between the one month follow up and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase detected increases in rCBF in the hippocampus bilaterally; further rCBF increases in the right hippocampus were detected after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, significant hypoperfusion was found in the right precentral, cingulate and medial frontal gyri in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase; after one month significant hypoperfusion was detected in the right precentral and cingulate gyri and the left postcentral gyrus; after one year no significant hypoperfusion appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The restoration of memory was paralleled by rCBF increases in the hippocampus and fronto-limbic-parietal cortex; after one year neither significant rCBF differences nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> had no long lasting cognitive and neural alterations in this patient </plain></SENT>
