<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a clinical condition that has been described in many studies, but its pathophysiology is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years the theory of valvular insufficiency in the jugular vein has been added to the classical hypotheses that link it to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and -the most widely accepted- to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), although the real origin of the condition has still not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study we compared 131 patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> between 1993 and 2004 with 262 patients who were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 65.94 years in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> versus 71.11 years in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a higher rate of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was more frequent among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05 in both cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboligenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was scarce among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and a history and the development of cerebrovascular diseases was greater among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> than in cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> recurrence rate was 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of pathological findings in the CAT brain scan was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are no significant differences between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> as far as treatment on hospital discharge is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> does not seem to be a symptom of an arteriosclerotic pathology nor does it appear to offer a higher risk of heart or cerebrovascular disease and, therefore, antiaggregating therapy would not be indicated in such cases </plain></SENT>
