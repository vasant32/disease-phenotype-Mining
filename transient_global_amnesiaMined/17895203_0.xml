<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test performed 6 days after the event showed global impairment in every domain, except for attention/concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan taken 8 days after the event showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal and frontal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of a follow-up SPECT scan on the 40th day after the episode were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
