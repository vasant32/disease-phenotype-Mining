<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the putative association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>57 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were compared to a double-size control group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients who also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were additionally compared to those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and to a second control group of outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and also of episodic tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, was markedly increased among <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Precipitants and accompanying vegetative symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> overlapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence of an interaction between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, in that the expression of key <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> features was not affected by comorbidity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present findings argue against the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> represents a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They conform to the hypothesis that the two conditions are essentially independent and result from an inherited brain state that disposes to different types of paroxysmal dysregulation, presumably at the level of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
