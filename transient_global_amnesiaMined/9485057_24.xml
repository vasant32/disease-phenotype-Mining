<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with the typical syndrome of a pure <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a coronal DW sequence, a steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence, and conventional T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 10 patients had elevated signal intensity in the left hippocampal region on DW MRI; moreover, 3 of these 7 patients exhibited bilateral signal abnormality in this sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> conventional T1- and T2-weighted images as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-up studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal elevation in DW MRI correlates with a decrease in the interstitial space and with cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the temporal lobe during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathomechanism causing this cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> cannot be clearly outlined using DW MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data are, however, compatible with spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to show that DW MRI is a sensitive MRI method for evaluating <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, especially in the early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
