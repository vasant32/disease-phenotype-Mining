<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our impression is that the primary cause of this syndrome is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> of the hippocampus, an opinion common with most earlier authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a unilateral hippocampal disturbance resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We are inclined to regard the local hippocampal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as arising from insufficiency of the anterior chorioidal artery and thus as a sequel of internal carotid insufficiency, which has earlier been proved to result from various rotatory, flexion, and extension movements of the neck </plain></SENT>
