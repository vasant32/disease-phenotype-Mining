<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, CQ was associated with cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) and with the neurodegenerative syndrome <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> myelo-optico-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMON</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the CQ induced loss of synaptic zinc, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and c-Fos induction in rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats, we found a strong reduction of histochemically reactive synaptic zinc no later than 4 h after the injection of the lowest dose of CQ (50 mg/kg) and, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses used, a return to control levels after 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for any dose and up to 1 week after CQ injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only a slight induction of c-Fos was seen in the hippocampus for the higher doses used (100-200 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In mice injected with 100 mg/kg, CQ also resulted in a fast loss of synaptic zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>c-Fos was induced after 4 h in cell populations of the hippocampal region and other parts of the telencephalon, and substantially increased after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One day after the injection we found a pattern of cell loss (hilus, parts of CA3, CA1 and layer III of the medial entorhinal cortex) reminiscent of that seen in models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with published data on the behavioral effects of zinc chelation and the modulatory effects of zinc in excitatory neurotransmission, our results indicate that the loss of synaptic zinc may have been involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and the neuropathology associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMON</z:e> </plain></SENT>
