<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms have been proposed but only trigger events have been clearly associated with the attack such as physical exertion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e>, sexual intercourse or immersion in cold water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to our knowledge, this is the first study, which associates trigger events and <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> recurrency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors which contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> recurrency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients consecutively admitted, performed clinical and neurological evaluation, electroencephalogram and structural brain imaging scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>-trigger events were evaluated and comorbidities were carefully recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk factor sum was calculated as the sum of the considered triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were grouped according to the presence of single <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (n = 73) or two episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 14.11% of patients experienced two episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis showed that the more increased number of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> the more number of trigger events (P &lt; 0.11; chi2 = 6.38; beta = -3.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations claim that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> may be considered a complex epiphenomenon, and the sum of the trigger factors can be responsible for recurring of this almost unique-in-life event </plain></SENT>
