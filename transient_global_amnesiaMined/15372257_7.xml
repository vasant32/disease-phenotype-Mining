<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some authors have suggested that subclinical impairment of memory functions may persist for much longer, but neuropsychological assessment lasting years after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack has not been performed so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate longterm cognitive functions in patients with a previous <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients underwent a standardised neuropsychological assessment after at least one-year from the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack, and were compared with 80 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients showed worse performances on tests evaluating verbal and nonverbal long-term memory and attention, with comparable global cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By applying current criteria for amnestic Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (MCI-a) on <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> subjects, a group consisting of 18/55 (32.7%) MCI-a subjects was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of MCI-a and demographic variables, vascular risk factors, years since the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episode, or ApoE genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> appears to be a relatively benign syndrome although objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> fulfilling MCI-a criteria persist over time, as detected by multidimensional neuropsychological tasks performed at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
