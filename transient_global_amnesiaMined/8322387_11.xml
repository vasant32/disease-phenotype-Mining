<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The popular concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> has been difficult to prove by cerebral blood flow studies during attacks because the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> attacks are so short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We performed single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain and neuropsychological assessment in a 37-year-old woman during a 10-hour attack and twice thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A neuropsychological evaluation 3 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> revealed severe impairment of recent memory and verbal fluency, both of which returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 2 and 28 days later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 99mTc-labeled hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> SPECT of the brain performed 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed multiple perfusion defects in both occipital lobes, the medial left temporal lobe, and the left thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second brain SPECT performed 3 days later showed perfusion defects in only the occipital regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third brain SPECT performed 28 days later was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's brain computed tomographic scan, electroencephalogram, duplex ultrasound of the carotid artery, and echocardiogram were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The perfusion defects revealed by the brain SPECT during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> attack indicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the territory of the posterior cerebral arteries, which partially resolved in 3 days and completely resolved by 28 days </plain></SENT>
