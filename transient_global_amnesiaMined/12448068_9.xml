<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We saw five inguinal or retroperitoneal venous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> with the need for operation in one patient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> needed drugs or cardioversion while the other patients with runs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> needed no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) 6 months after implantation we found four significant residual leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients had the defect closed with a second device </plain></SENT>
