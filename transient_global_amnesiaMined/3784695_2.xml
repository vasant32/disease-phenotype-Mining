<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> is poorly understood, although involvement of the medial temporal lobe is most likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that once an underlying structural lesion has been ruled out, cases can be divided into three groups: patients with a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headaches</z:hpo>, those who have no obvious underlying precipitating factors, and those with associated neurologic deficits during a spell and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the first group tend to have attacks at an earlier age and to have an increased recurrence rate but, like those in the second group, have a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the third group often have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> later in life, and as many as 10% may have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether or not this is a higher incidence than should be expected in persons of this age group has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although sophisticated testing may show persistence of the memory defect, most patients eventually recover completely </plain></SENT>
