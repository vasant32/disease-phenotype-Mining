<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) present with a characteristic clinical syndrome although other differential diagnoses have to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) represents a highly specific diagnostic tool in the context of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>; however, standard clinical DWI often fails to detect the small characteristic hippocampal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic success of DWI sequences in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients was analyzed with respect to slice thickness and time interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 198 patients with clinically diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DWI studies were grouped according to the slice thickness applied (3 mm, 5 mm and 6 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three groups were assessed for group-specific detection rates of hippocampal lesions with diffusion restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition the detection rates were evaluated with respect to the time interval between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant increase in detection rates (about 8.4% per mm) was found when thinner slices were acquired (44.7% for 3 mm, 27.1% for 5 mm and 19.6% for 6 mm slice thickness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection rate was highest (up to 80%) when MRI was performed 2 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MRI protocol in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> should include a DWI sequence with a slice thickness of 3 mm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The examination should be performed on day 2 after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to fully exploit the diagnostic value of DWI which represents a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
