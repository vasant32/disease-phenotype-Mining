<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The slope value of the linear function, a measure of cognitive memory scanning speed, decreased with time and showed a marked decrease 1 week after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, suggesting that the stage of serial and exhaustive scanning recovered within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The zero-intercept value, on the other hand, increased during 1 week but decreased 4 weeks later and was not related directly to recovery from <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance in RNG task improved 1 week later, but deteriorated 4 weeks after the episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a change in RNG was in accordance with that of the zero-intercept value, predicting a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e>, detected with these tasks, persisted longer than clinical recovery from <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
