<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is of interest to record event-related potentials in the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) because the hippocampus and diencephalon, generally considered to be the sites of the dysfunction responsible for the amnesic episodes are also considered as two possible generators of the P300 wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the only four cases reported so far in the literature showed an intact auditive P300 in three cases and an intact auditive P300 with reduction of visual P300 in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here are reported four new cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P300 wave was readily identifiable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases, without any amplitude reduction, thus suggesting that the condition did not entail inactivation or functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of P300 generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concerning P300 latency, in one case it was delayed but became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second case, the latency, although within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, shortened after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the third and the fourth cases, the latency, initially within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These apparently disparate results should be analysed in the light of the results of isotope measurement of cerebral blood flow during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, which are also inconsistent but most frequently indicate bilateral temporal or thalamic flow reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined in the future whether the stability or change in the P300 will make it possible to predict the brain region involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, which could perhaps vary from one patient to another </plain></SENT>
