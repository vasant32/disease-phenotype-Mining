<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of case-control studies was conducted using Medline, Current contents connect, ISI Web of Knowledge, Biological abstracts and Scopus, plus citations of selected studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses to assess the effect of methods of IJVR determination, blinding of studies, and definition of IJVR on the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven studies were included in the first meta-analysis which investigated the frequency of IJVR in 312 patients and 261 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IJVR was more common in patients (OR 5.867, 95 % CI 3.895-8.838,) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of blinded studies did not alter our results (OR 10.894, 95 % CI 5.396-21.996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another meta-analysis with seven studies was performed in which, IJVR was more frequent in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and precipitating factors compared with those without any identifiable precipitating factors (OR 2.889, 95 % CI 1.748-4.777) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IJVR is a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with history of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> spells had IJVR and this, together with higher frequency of IJVR in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> who experienced precipitating events, showed the need of considering several other factors in further primary researches </plain></SENT>
