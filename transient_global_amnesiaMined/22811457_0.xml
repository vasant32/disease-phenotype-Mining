<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) has been associated with an increased prevalence of internal jugular valve insufficiency and many patients report Valsalva-associated maneuvers before <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings have led to the assumption of hemodynamic alterations in intracranial veins inducing focal hippocampal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated this hypothesis in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and 75 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were enrolled into a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracranial and transcranial high-resolution venous echo-color-Doppler sonography was performed blindly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow direction and velocities were recorded at the internal jugular veins, basal veins of Rosenthal, and vein of Galen, both at rest and during Valsalva-associated maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was 60.3Â±8.0 years (median, 60 years; range, 44-78 years); 44 (59%) were female (female/male ratio: 1.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal jugular valve insufficiency (left, right, or bilateral) was found to be more frequent in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> than in control subjects: 53 (70.7%) versus 22 (29.3%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities in the deep cerebral veins of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> did not differ from control subjects both at rest and during Valsalva-associated maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial venous reflux was neither observed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> nor in control subjects despite unilateral or bilateral internal jugular valve insufficiency during prolonged and maximal Valsalva-associated maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study, although confirming the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and internal jugular valve insufficiency, challenges the hypothesis that cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
