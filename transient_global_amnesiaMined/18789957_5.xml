<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies revealed that small and punctate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-signal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions can be found within the hippocampus of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients during the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of dual-process models of recognition memory, the present study examined the hypothesis that hippocampal dysfunction as suggested by these DWI lesions disrupts hippocampus-mediated recollection in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, whereas familiarity-based recognition memory that is assumed to be supported by extra-hippocampal brain regions should be unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We administered a recognition memory task for faces and words to eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients during the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and to eleven matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were obtained in order to derive estimates of familiarity and recollection by applying a formal dual-process model of recognition memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of ROC curves revealed a disruption of recollection in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients' memory for words [t(20)=2.70, p&lt;.05], but no difference in familiarity-based recognition memory between patients and controls [t(20)=-1.10, p=.284] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post hoc analyses indicated that the deficit in recollection is more pronounced in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients who show visible hippocampal lesions on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging compared to those without detectable hippocampal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, consistent with recent neuroanatomical dual-process models of recognition memory, hippocampal dysfunction in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is associated with a selective effect on specific recognition memory subprocesses </plain></SENT>
