<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to find an optimal DWI protocol for lesion detection in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> by investigating various imaging parameters and imaging timing after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> diagnosed during 14 months underwent DWI within 24 hours and again at follow-up 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each DWI session included 4 different sequences using different b-values (seconds per square millimeter) and section thicknesses (millimeter): 1000/5, 1000/3, 2000/3, and 3000/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of hyperintense lesions on the 8 DWIs was determined visually, and the number of lesions detected was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of the 16 patients (81%) had either single or multiple punctate hyperintense lesions, totaling 24 lesions, and the remaining 3 patients had no lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions detected were in the hippocampus except 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions detected on initial DWIs at a b-value/section thickness of 1000/5, 1000/3, 2000/3, and 3000/3 was 3, 9, 13, and 13, respectively, whereas that of follow-up DWIs was 17, 22, 24, and 24, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of these preliminary results, the highest lesion detection was achieved for DWI with b = 2000/3 mm or b = 3000/3 mm at 3 days postonset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When no lesion is detected by DWI within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, follow-up DWI is recommended several days later </plain></SENT>
