<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study cognitive function and cerebral metabolic changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were given mini-mental state examination (MMSE), revised Wechsler memory scale (WMS-R) examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans after they had been diagnosed as <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using (18)F labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> as tracer, patients were given a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) examination at different periods during recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No obvious abnormality was found in MMSE and MRI scans in the three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, WMS-R examination and cerebral PET imaging displayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> of varying degrees and low metabolism in local areas related to memory in 2 of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients, cognitive function and cerebral metabolic levels are closely correlated with duration of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to stop the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack as quickly as possible early time </plain></SENT>
