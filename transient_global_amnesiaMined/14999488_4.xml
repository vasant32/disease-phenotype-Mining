<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of motor cortical areas in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 13 patients during and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of a typical episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measures of cortical excitability included motor threshold (MT) to magnetic stimulation, cortical silent period (SP) duration and intracortical inhibition (ICI) using a paired-pulse TMS technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found thalamic hypoperfusion and an ipsilateral significantly decreased ICI during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced activity in inhibitory circuits may explain why PET studies of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> showed neocortical hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that frontal cortex dysfunction probably due to damage affecting the thalamocortical circuits may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
