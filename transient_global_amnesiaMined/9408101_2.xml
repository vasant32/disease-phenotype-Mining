<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous reports about changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> disclosed decreased flow in some parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CBF analyses in most reports were qualitative but not quantitative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine changes in CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CBF was measured and the vasoreactive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was evaluated in six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured during an attack in two patients and soon after an attack in the other four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About one month later, CBF was re-evaluated in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients examined during an attack and one patient examined five hours after an attack had increased blood flow in the occipital cortex and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients examined at six to 10 hours after an attack had decreased blood flow in the thalamus, cerebellum, or putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities of blood flow almost disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients one month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, which was evaluated initially using SPECT, was poor in areas of increased blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By the second evaluation of CBF with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, the vasodilatory response had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, CBF increased in the vertebrobasilar territory during the attack and decreased afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> may be impaired in the parts of the brain with increased blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> is distinct from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> but may share the same underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
