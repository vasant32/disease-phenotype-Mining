<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuromuscular transmission (NMT) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) using single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> remains unknown and several elements support the hypothesis of a shared background with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed that some migraineurs have subclinical abnormalities of NMT by using SFEMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> using SFEMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 6 patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> according to published criteria and 5 healthy volunteers with similar ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SFEMG during voluntary contraction of the extensor digitorum communis muscle, nerve conduction studies and concentric needle electromyography were performed and 20 single fiber potential pairs were recorded from each subject and individual and mean jitter values were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> showed pronounced NMT failure by SFEMG, whereas none of the controls disclosed this abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean jitter value of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients (35+/-33) was greater than that of the control subjects (25+/-15) (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 120 individual jitter values of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> group and only 3 (from 3 different volunteers) of the 100 individual jitter values of the control group exceeded upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> shares the same type of subclinical abnormality of NMT observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients in recent studies </plain></SENT>
