<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the latter patient the temporal anomaly was reversible after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> injection but clinical improvement was lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow determinations in a further patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, after 2 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4826">ergotamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, showed a global decline in flow without focal anomaly, with recovery after ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values obtained in two other patients 24 and 38 hours respectively after typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> attacks were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> appears related to a direct neuronal action although the role of endorphins in this affection is not conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these anomalies with those noted by Reichle with position emission tomography imaging suggests a primary neuronal mechanism </plain></SENT>
