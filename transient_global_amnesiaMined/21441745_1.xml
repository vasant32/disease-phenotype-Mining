<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast medium showed a lobulated heterogeneously enhanced cystic lesion attached to the superior surface of the right tentorium, indenting the right temporal lobe laterally and midbrain medially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small part of the lesion was located under the right tentorium and did not involve the right trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion was subtotally resected via the subtemporal approach and did not affect the trochlear and trigeminal nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed that the lesion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannomas</z:hpo> usually arise from the cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present case of tentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo> not associated with the cranial nerves is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
