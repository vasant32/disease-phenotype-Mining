<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the first description of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) in 1964, its etiology has remained obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reversible diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities in the hippocampus have been found on MRI of some patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implication of this is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 47 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> between November 2004 and November 2009, and enrolled 27 patients with brain MRI within 72 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for analysis and recorded subsequent relapse or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 27 patients had reversible hippocampal punctuate hyperintensities, with complete resolution noted on a second MRI on average 4 months after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a first relapse (their second <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack) had a significantly higher association of DWI hippocampal abnormalities (p=0.03) compared to patients with their first <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 27 patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or further relapse during the mean follow-up period of 32.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> have a significantly higher association of reversible DWI abnormality </plain></SENT>
