<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SPET images were anatomically standardized using SPM99 followed by quantification of 318 constant ROIs, grouped into 12 segments (callosomarginal, precentral, central, parietal, angular, temporal, posterior cerebral, pericallosal, lenticular nucleus, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum), in each hemisphere to calculate segmental CBF (sCBF) as the area-weighted mean value for each of the respective 12 segments based on the regional CBF in each ROI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the intra- and post-episodic sCBF of each of the 12 segments of the eight patients was estimated by scatter-plot graphical analysis and Pearson's correlation test with Fisher's Z-transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the control, (99m)Tc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPET was performed on eight subjects (three men and five women) and repeated within 1 month; the correlation between the first and second sCBF values of each of the 12 segments was evaluated in the same way as for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excellent reproducibility between the two sCBF values was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 segments of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant correlation between intra- and post-episodic sCBF was not shown in the thalamus or angular segments of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study was preliminary, but at least suggested that thalamus and angular regions are closely involved in the symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
