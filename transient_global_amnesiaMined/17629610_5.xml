<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral venous reflux mostly results from left brachiocephalic venous obstruction, and the level of reflux depends on different respiratory status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For further understanding of the role of venous outflow impairment in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, we used color duplex sonography to reveal the flow patterns in the internal jugular vein (IJV) and its branches (JB) under different respiratory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of abnormal venous flow of IJV and/or JB on color duplex sonography between 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and 17 age- and gender-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals both at rest (regular breathing) and at deep inspiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, these venous-flow abnormalities in IJV and JB were well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial 3-D time-of-flight magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients three to seven days after their <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attacks and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals to analyze the abnormal flow signals in the intracranial venous structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the result, abnormal flow-patterns in the left IJV and/or left JB during regular breathing were found more frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (65% vs. 6%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were (1) isolated reversed flow in the left JB, (2) segmental reversed flow in the left distal IJV and (3) continuous reversed flow in the left IJV and JB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MRA study revealed that only the most severe reflux in the IJV causes intracranial venous reflux; six were in the group of continuous reversed flow in left IJV and one was in the group of segmental reversed flow in left distal IJV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> might be one of the clinical manifestations of the "cerebral-type intermittent venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>," which stems from cerebral venous outflow impairment, insufficient venous collaterals and specific precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
