<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical and pathophysiological basis of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> is presumed to be similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>), that is, it is likely to be primarily hippocampal in origin, but with more variable involvement of limbic and adjacent temporal lobe neocortical structures </plain></SENT>
