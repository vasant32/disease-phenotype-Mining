<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive carotid artery testing was performed in 56 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> to determine if they had the same incidence of extracranial atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> as patients with focal cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 56 patients had hemodynamic obstruction of flow at the carotid artery bifurcation, and 41 of 56 had no evidence of any atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were present in 24 of 56 patients, but only 1 had a prior cerebrovascular event </plain></SENT>
