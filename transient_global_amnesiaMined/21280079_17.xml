<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An impaired cerebrospinal venous drainage, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrospinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> (CCSVI), has been recently hypothesized to be the possible cause of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated this hypothesis by studying the occurrence of CCSVI in clinically isolated syndromes (CISs) suggestive of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with a CIS and evidence of dissemination in space of the inflammatory lesions (ie, possible MS [pMS]) underwent a detailed diagnostic workup, including extracranial and transcranial venous echo-color Doppler sonography (ECDS-TCDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with CCSVI underwent selective venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty healthy subjects (HCs) age-matched and gender-matched with pMS patients (HC1); 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>); and 60 healthy subjects age-matched and gender-matched with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients (HC2) constituted the control groups and underwent ECDS-TCDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of pMS patients was 33.0 ± 8.5 years (range, 14-50); 35 (70%) were female (female:male ratio, 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCDS was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pMS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One or more abnormal ECDS findings were observed in 26 of 50 (52.0%) pMS patients, in 35 of 110 (31·8%) HCs (HC1+HC2), and in 41 of 60 (68.3%) <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight (16%) pMS patients fulfilled the diagnosis of CCSVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selective phlebography performed in 7 of these patients (1 denied consent) did not show venous anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support a cause-effect relationship between CCSVI and pMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to clarify whether CCSVI is associated with later disease stages and characterizes the progressive forms of MS </plain></SENT>
