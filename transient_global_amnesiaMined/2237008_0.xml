<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients had recurrent attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, and another three had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although at some distance from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Association was noted with certain risk factors including <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, and angiopathic changes of the eye fundus (in 50% of the patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (in 30%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (in 10%), and essential polyglobulia (in 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coagulation studies including thrombelastograms were carried out in 22 patients, and demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in 50% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in the arterial wall were noted in 85% of the 14 patients in whom carotid sphygmograms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of these risk factors could explain the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalograms performed immediately or a short time after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> attack have evidenced in 18 patients rapid-type dysrhythmia, or diffuse theta waves, predominantly located in the deep layers of the left and right temporal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEG tracings were either flat or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the remaining 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 patients presenting with global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233796" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">transient amnesia</z:e> only two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in antecedents, and another six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> during the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurologic examination did not reveal any abnormality in 27 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequelar signs of neurological deficits were noted in the remaining three patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
