<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the utility of DWI and the presence of hippocampal lesions in the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 203 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episodes were diagnosed at our emergency department from January 2003 to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI (5-mm slice thickness) was performed using a 1.5 T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of hippocampal lesions on DWI: DWI- and DWI+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics and the time interval from development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 16 patients had hippocampal lesions on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DWI- and DWI+ groups had similar clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall median time interval from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> to MRI was 6 h, and this interval was significantly longer for the DWI+ group than the DWI- group [9 h (IQR 6.5-25) vs. 5 h (IQR 4-9), p = 0.002] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI has a low diagnostic yield when performed early in the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive findings can confirm the diagnosis, but in negative results, careful interpretation is required, including the time interval from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> to MRI </plain></SENT>
