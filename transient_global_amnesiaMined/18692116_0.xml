<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is still unknown but clinical and neuroimaging studies support a hippocampi involvement, and some reports suggested a possible common genetic background in cases of familial <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene that causes a valine to methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met) has been demonstrated to affect human memory and hippocampal function in the development and maintenance of adult neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> risk and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and 93 age-matched controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent clinical and neurological examination, routine blood examination, EEG, Jugular vein valve (JVI) competence assessment, and neuroimaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> characteristics were carefully recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of BDNF genotype did not differ in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients compared to controls (BDNF GG: 58.2% vs 55.9%, GA: 33.7% vs 36.6%, AA: 8.1% vs 7.5%, P=.91) as well as allele frequency (BDNF G, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> vs CON: 75.0% vs 74.2, P=.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, disease duration and recurrence or the presence of predisposing factors between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients carrying BDNF AA, BDNF GA and BDNF GG genotype were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study, that firstly looked at genetic background in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, did not show a significant correlation between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, risk factors, duration or recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
