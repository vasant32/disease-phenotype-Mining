<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis of the cognitive characteristics of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> addressed two main issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we examined the hypothesis that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is associated with changes of anterograde and retrograde episodic long-term memory sparing semantic and short-term memory, while we had no clear prediction for potential reductions of executive functions due to the relative lack of previous studies addressing this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we analyzed the time-course of changes in cognitive functions throughout three time intervals--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (0-24 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), postacute (24 hours to 5 days), and long-term phase (5-30 days)--to reveal whether there is a fast versus a delayed recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the meta-analysis on 152 effect sizes from 25 studies showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is characterized by an extraordinarily large reduction of anterograde (d* = 1.89) and a somewhat milder reduction of retrograde (d* = 1.28) episodic long-term memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results indicate the existence of additional, nonamnestic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, because executive functions were also diminished (d* = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions in both anterograde episodic long-term memory and executive function recover slowly, as slightly poorer performance in these cognitive domains can be found in the postacute phase (d*s = 0.32 and 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cognitive diminutions resolved within the long-term phase, by this calling into question previous reports of poorer performance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients relative to comparison subjects weeks or months after the attack </plain></SENT>
