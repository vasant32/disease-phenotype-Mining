<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> is associated with psychopathological disorders and to assess the influence of these psychopathological disorders on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> before and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> were rated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory performances were assessed by means of original episodic memory tasks and working memory tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were collected in 17 individuals observed during the very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 18 individuals examined in the peri-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and 26 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> displayed a higher level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and a more depressed mood than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An alteration of emotional state, as measured by the Adjective Mood Scale, was correlated with deficits in anterograde memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> comprises sudden changes in people's emotional state, which has a major impact on and interacts with episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
