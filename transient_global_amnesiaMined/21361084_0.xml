<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies, including studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, and focal hippocampal lesions have been detected in some studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate serial changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images from the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients, serial MRI scans (from the same day of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to several days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) using a 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four patients, the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was over 12 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of those patients showed small punctate hippocampal hypersensitivity with decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values on DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These lesions were detected in the postacute phase (a time window of 24 - 48 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In follow-up studies performed several days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, DWI lesions had disappeared in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (7-10 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episode) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The delayed hippocampal lesion on DW images with 1.5-T MRI in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> appears to be associated with longer duration of symptoms, to persist for several days and to disappear in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
