<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain perfusion single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was shown to be abnormal during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and to become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with normalization of memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data are known about the brain perfusion pattern among these patients with recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were studied with an initial brain imaging during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of their attack, and a second imaging was performed after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the event of a patients having a second abnormal brain perfusion HMPAO SPECT, a third imaging was performed after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypofusion perfusion was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had a first <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SPECT was demonstrated after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients with recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, the brain perfusion remained abnormal after 3 months and after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> after 3 months can be expected in a patient with a first attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attacks, a persistent focal hypoperfusion can be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This subgroup of patients may demonstrate a non-benign type of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, eventually due to a different etiology of event </plain></SENT>
