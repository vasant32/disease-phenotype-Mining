<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the lesion detection rate in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> using 1.5T and 3.0T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> probable ischemic lesions were defined as regions of high-signal intensity in diffusion weighted image with corresponding low-signal intensity in apparent diffusion coefficient map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 3.0T MRI showed 11 out of 32 patients with probable ischemic lesions in the hippocampus with mean lesion size of 2.8 +/- 0.6 mm, whereas 1.5T MRI detected no lesion in any of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the groups of 1.5 and 3.0T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-field strength MRI has a higher detection rate of probable ischemic lesions than low-field strength MRI in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
