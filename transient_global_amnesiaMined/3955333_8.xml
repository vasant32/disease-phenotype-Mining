<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During these attacks, patients were unable to form new memories for 2 to 24 hours, had extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e>, voiced repetitive queries and were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233407" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">disorientated</z:e> for time, but were otherwise intact neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these episodes were attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> triggered by the mild blows to the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also suggest that they constitute a previously unrecognized variety of traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
