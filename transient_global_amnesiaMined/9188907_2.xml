<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine the incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the new cases of first-ever-in-a-lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> in the Belluno province, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only two prospective epidemiological studies on <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> incidence have been performed to date, non in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to provide reliable and comparable information on <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We undertook a prospective population-based study in the territory of the province of Bulluno, Italy, between June 1, 1992 and December 31, 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> seen in the hospitals of the study area from January 1, 1985 through May 31, 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the prospective study period we identified 77 patients who experienced a first-ever <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crude annual incidence rate was 10.4/100,000 (9.35/100,000 for men and 11.37/100,000 for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment to the European population, the incidence rate decreased to 8.60/100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The crude annual incidence rate during the retrospective study period was 5.81/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The demographic and clinical features of the two groups did not differ one to the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of first-ever <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> registered in the province of Belluno, Italy, was closely similar to that reported in Turku, Finland and confirms that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is more common than has been usually proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the usefulness of prospective, rather than retrospective, epidemiological studies for research on <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
