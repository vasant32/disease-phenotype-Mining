<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of antero- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e>, accompanied by temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> and iterative questioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now established that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase is associated with a raised level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and a depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a thorough investigation of patients' perceptions of their disease state, focusing on the links between their lack of explicit knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and their emotional experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Explicit knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> was assessed during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> by means of an original scale inspired by Bisiach et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1986) and self-reported scales measuring patients' perceptions of their current memory and their cognitive and behavioural functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, we probed the patients' emotional experience (sources of worry, and levels of worry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) via questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from 20 patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 16 in the peri-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 16 who were assessed the day after the episode and 14 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a follow-up examination 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase displayed a lack of explicit knowledge of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> and overestimated their memory performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also expressed higher levels of worry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than controls, and a more depressed mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although they were aware of their disease state, the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were unable to identify the nature of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> and overestimated their memory performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These memory misperceptions and the inability to acknowledge memory failure occurred concomitantly with changes in the patients' emotional state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This particular pattern of awareness could be regarded as a reaction to the suddenness and massiveness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
