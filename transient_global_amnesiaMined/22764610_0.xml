<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients become <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233407" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">disorientated</z:e> in time and place, but not in person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Automated motor tasks are preserved; however, the retention of new information is impaired, with clear implications to a pilot's fitness to fly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) experience of pilots with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and compares it to the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The UK CAA medical records database was searched for subjects who had reported a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> between the years 1990 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subject age and gender, the frequency and duration of episodes, the follow-up period, precipitants, and associated features were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A literature search for papers with similar information was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The UK CAA database showed 29 subjects who had held a UK CAA medical certificate with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 28 male individuals and 1 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 59 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 3.4 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average duration of an episode was 2.8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Activity, stress, or exposure to cold water were reported as possible precipitants by 16 subjects (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 6 subjects (21%) who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and 10 (34%) who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From the literature, 10 papers were reviewed and compared to our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The aeromedical implications of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, including its etiology, associations, misdiagnosis, and recurrence risk are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A policy for the certification of pilots following <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is proposed </plain></SENT>
