<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old lady with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was studied with PET in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (early recovery) phase of an otherwise typical episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up over &gt; 1 year was uneventful, and delayed CT scans and MRI showed no brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No medical cause was disclosed despite extensive work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PET study revealed a matched reduction in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption over the entire lateral frontal cortex on the right side, with an associated, less significant reduction in ipsilateral thalamic and lentiform nucleus metabolism, but sparing the hippocampal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes, which had resolved at a repeat PET study 3 months later, suggest right prefrontal metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, possibly secondary to thalamic dysfunction, as the underlying mechanism for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> in this case, consistent with the emerging involvement of the prefrontal cortex in strategies or control of memory traces retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in analogy with permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> may be a core syndrome with several possible foci of dysfunction along the neuronal networks that subserve explicit memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the future, combined PET neuropsychological assessment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> may prove useful in defining distinct neuropsychological-topographical subtypes of this intriguing clinical entity </plain></SENT>
