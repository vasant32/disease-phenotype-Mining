<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the presence or absence of vascular risk factors (VRF) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is associated with different clinical data and/or examination findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was made of two groups of 13 and 12 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, who presented with and without VRF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following variables were determined: VRF, age, a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, triggering factors, duration and repetition of the episodes, associated neurological symptoms and findings obtained by neuroimaging, eco-Doppler of the supra-aortic trunks and transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were subjected to statistical analysis by univariate analysis with Fischer's exact probability test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The statistical studies showed no significant differences between the variables obtained in the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> has been particularly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and cerebral vascular pathology, although its aetiology has not been fully determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare clinical data between the two groups of patients with and without VRF who have had <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of significant differences between them tends to rule out a vascular aetiology as the sole cause of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently Leao's propagated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has been suggested as the physiopathological mechanism involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to this theory, the vascular pathology might act as the trigger but probably not as the aetiological factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings of our study may support this thesis </plain></SENT>
