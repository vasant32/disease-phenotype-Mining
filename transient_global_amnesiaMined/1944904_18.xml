<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPECT during the attack showed a significant diminution of regional blood flow in the left thalamus and a less marked diminution in the right thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative evaluation of global 99mTc-HMPAO uptake indicated a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At follow-up to 40 days after the attack, global uptake and thalamic flow indices normalized, but there was a persistent reduction of left frontal flow values </plain></SENT>
