<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristic punctate high-signal intensity lesions in the hippocampus on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been reported in variable frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of the timing of DWI and the magnetic field strength on the lesion detectability in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-three patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> underwent DWI within 24 h after the symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and again on day 3 at either 1.5 (n = 31) or 3 T (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three subgroups according to the time lapse after the symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the first DWI (0-6 h, 6-12 h, and 12-24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection rate of the lesions during the first 24 h rose statistically significantly with increased time lapse after the symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (34% in 0-6 h, 62% in 6-12 h, and 67% in 12-24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It increased up to 75% on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection rate was higher at 3 T than at 1.5 T in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (41% vs. 27% in 0-6 h, 70% vs. 44% in 6-12 h, 80% vs. 57% in 12-24 h, and 86% vs. 61% on day 3), but the statistical significance was achieved only on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Awareness of the different lesion detectability on DWI according to the time lapse after the symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> can help in diagnosing the patients with suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High field strength is another important factor to increase the lesion detectability on DWI </plain></SENT>
