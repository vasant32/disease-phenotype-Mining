<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of 99mTc-HMPAO in brain is in proportion to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and can be interpreted as functional mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate local changes in CBF during neuropsychological testing, we developed a new subtraction method using HMPAO and SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With patients resting, 15 mCi of HMPAO was injected and the first acquisition was performed, lasting a total of 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soon after the end of the first scan, patients were requested to undergo Buschke's memory test or to repeat words or numbers (repetition test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the task, an additional 15 mCi of HMPAO was injected using the same position as in the first scan, and a second acquisition was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A functional image was made by subtracting the image in the first scan from that in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, Buschke's memory test was performed in combination with SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Relative increase in activity was seen in the thalamus, subthalamic area, hippocampus, and some cortical areas, apparently reflecting local functional change induced by the memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients with moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, no increase was detected in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, the repetition test with SPECT was correlated with the WADA test and dichotic listening test, and good agreement was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our new SPECT technique is useful in detecting alterations in rCBF during mental activity and can be applied to neurophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
