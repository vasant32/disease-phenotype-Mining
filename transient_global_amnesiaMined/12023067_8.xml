<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) provides relevant pathophysiologic data, but only three patients have been reported so far and in only one was concomitant neuropsychological testing performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the concomitant neuropsychological and PET assessment of two additional patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Episodic disturbance was characterized by a storage disturbance for one case and an incapacity to learn episodic associations in the other, illustrating cognitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> despite similar neurological presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET findings disclosed mild but significant changes in the amygdala (right or left) and left posterior hippocampus, which could account for both the storage disturbance and the inability to associate episodic components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PET findings also argued in favor of a vascular disturbance accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
