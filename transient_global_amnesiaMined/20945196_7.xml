<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detailed critique of the literature on focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> is provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the cases commonly cited in this literature had, in fact, severely impaired anterograde memory, most often involving visuospatial material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other cases showed poor anterograde memory in more moderate or subtle form, begging the question of whether "like" had really been compared with "like" across the retrograde and anterograde domains: there may be alternative explanations for the observed patterns of performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One suggestion is that these patients suffer an impairment of long-term consolidation, an attractive hypothesis but one which requires much more rigorous testing than has occurred to date and which implies that the underlying problem is not specific to retrograde memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, within the literature on cases of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e>, differing patterns of performance on tests of autobiographical memory or remote semantic knowledge have been reported, and sometimes these may have reflected factors other than the sites of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the most convincing cases in this literature have been those in whom there was an initially severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> as well as an extensive retrograde loss: in these cases, the critical issue is what determines differential patterns of recovery across these domains-it is likely that both physiological and psychological factors are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second, somewhat different, group are patients with semantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, who show a pronounced recency effect in remote memory but, in these cases, the most parsimonious explanation may be in terms of predominantly semantic/linguistic and/or strategic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third group are those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273059" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">transient epileptic amnesia</z:e> but, in these cases, the memory gaps may reflect past (anterograde) ictal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A fourth group are those in whom psychogenic factors may well be relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although it is difficult to "prove" psychological causation, the logical difficulties in attributing causation where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> are either very subtle or multiple have been considerably underestimated in the neuropsychological literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given these problems, in uncertain or equivocal cases, it is as critical to present the relevant psychological data for the reader to evaluate as it is to provide the pertinent memory test scores: this is underemphasised in many of the studies reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Publication of cases in the absence of such data may lead to faulty clinical, neuropsychological, and cognitive conclusions </plain></SENT>
