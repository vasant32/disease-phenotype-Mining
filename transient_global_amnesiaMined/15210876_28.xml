<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been unable to demonstrate consistently the location and underlying pathology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> using serial DWI performed from the day of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> through days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After reporting negative DWI results in a previous study, the authors used a modified study design to investigate patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> using serial DWI performed from the day of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> through days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 31 consecutive patients studied, 26 developed a small, punctate DWI lesion in the lateral aspect of the hippocampal formation (pes and fimbria hippocampi) on either side (left, n = 15; right, n = 6) or bilaterally (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were rarely noted in the hyperacute phase (n = 2), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> became visible regularly at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the involvement of hippocampal parenchyma in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delayed detectability of the lesions may explain the incongruence of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> DWI studies in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
