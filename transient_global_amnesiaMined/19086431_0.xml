<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> that appeared to resolve within 24 hours, and they showed no abnormal findings on electroencephalography or single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the results of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) on the ninth (case2) or tenth day (case1) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) revealed a unilateral high-intensity area in the hippocampus, leading to the diagnosis of hippocampal infarction in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1 had a left hippocampal lesion and exhibited impairment of predominantly verbal memory, while case 2 had a right hippocampal lesion and demonstrated impairment of predominantly visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When evaluating a patient with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, imaging of the hippocampus and tests on memory function after an appropriate interval from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are often helpful in establishing a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
