<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diffusion restrictions are associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions on the cognitive long-term outcome in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen otherwise healthy patients with the clinical syndrome of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, who had MRI investigations on admission as well as 1 day later, were investigated with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery 2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> hippocampal DWI lesions in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were detected in almost two thirds of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychometric evaluation revealed no differences in cognitive performance between patients with and without DWI lesions as well as compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no relapse of the attack has been recognized in either group of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
