<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> in whom an EEG recording, performed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the neurological event, showed SREDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this EEG finding, we discuss about a possible correlation between SREDA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of SREDA in our patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> seems to be incidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When described in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, SREDA should be recognized in order to avoid misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although SREDA has been fortuitously described in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, a patho-physiological correlation with mechanisms which produce it seems unlikely </plain></SENT>
