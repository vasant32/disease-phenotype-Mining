<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two similar cases were observed in our clinic last year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil is a potent inhibitor of cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate in the corpus cavernosum and therefore, increases the penile response to sexual stimulation and is used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most severe and life-threatening complications of Sildenafil are associated with combined administration with nitrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not significantly differ between Sildenafil-treated and placebo-treated patients; therefore, Sildenafil does not appear contraindicated in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scanty data are available regarding Sildenafil and cerebrovascular disease and there are only a few case reports regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) after Sildenafil use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> are described immediately following the use of one dose of Sildenafil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is not yet completely understood but one of the hypothesizes suggests that the pathophysiology of this condition is related to intracranial vasomotor changes, especially due to venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of bilateral hippocampal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also well known that Sildenafil stimulates the relaxation of smooth muscle and causes vasomotor changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on this report, as well as previous reports, it is suggested that a single dose of Sildenafil may stimulate <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
