<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> demonstrates a high frequency of high signal intensities restricted to the hippocampus, and this has been proposed as an etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to characterize the DWI and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi>-emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and recovered phases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and to correlate the findings with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>oculomotor abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> underwent DWI and SPECT of the brain within 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and again 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eye movements were also recorded using three-dimensional video-oculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, DWI disclosed small punctuate (1-3 mm), high-signal lesions in the lateral portion of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial SPECT also revealed hypoperfusion in the cerebellar vermis, which had recovered by the follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed saccadic hypermetria or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007772'>impaired smooth pursuit</z:hpo> only during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> showed cerebellar vermian hypoperfusion in addition to ischemic insults to the lateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>oculomotor abnormalities</z:hpo> observed in our patients support the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> during the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack </plain></SENT>
