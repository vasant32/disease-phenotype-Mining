<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The literature on this syndrome was surveyed and 50 case reports found to meet the latest criteria of classification requiring at least two similar attacks for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (except for common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> which was excluded from review) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>33 subjects had at least one trauma-triggered attack and one identical or similar spontaneous attack, 17 cases at least two similar or identical trauma triggered attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases showed the following features: The symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> mostly start with a latency between one and thirty minutes after the injury and dissolve within one day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First attacks without mention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were mainly found in children younger than 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trauma-triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks are well documented for familial hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks with hemispheric symptoms and attacks with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo>, while the view that posttraumatic transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks is insufficiently supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A hereditary predisposition for a traumatic trigger mechanism seems to be present at least in familial hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
