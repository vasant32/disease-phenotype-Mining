<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>25 patients had one or more risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG examination revealed abnormal activity only in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain Computed Tomography showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in 10 and hypodense lesions in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 patients had been followed up for a mean interval of 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 4 patients had recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up group, 15 patients showed permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of risk factors for cerebrovascular disease seems to confirm that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is probably due to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high rate of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, almost always connected with the coexistence of cerebrovascular risk factors, is not in agreement with the postulated good prognosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
