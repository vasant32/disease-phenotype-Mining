<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CQ forms lipophilic chelates with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cations</z:chebi> and has the potential as a scientific and clinical tool used for selective modulation of histochemically reactive zinc pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship among transient lack of synaptic zinc release, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and cognitive memory is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of synaptic zinc release, in the present study, hippocampal LTP induction and cognitive behavior were examined in young rats after i.p. injection of CQ (30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular zinc detected by Timm's stain and extracellular (synaptic cleft) zinc detected by ZnAF-2 were significantly decreased in the hippocampus 6 h after CQ injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in which perforant path-granule cell synapses exist, was most responsive to CQ injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dentate gyrus LTP was induced similarly to the control 2 h after CQ injection, while significantly attenuated 6-24 h after CQ injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the training trial of the object recognition memory 2 h after CQ injection, there was no significant difference in learning behavior between the control and CQ-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the test trial, CQ-treated rats showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> recognition memory 1 h after the training, whereas recognition <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> 24 h after the training unlike the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exposure to CQ impairs long-term (24 h) memory in the hippocampus of young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CQ-mediated attenuation of dentate gyrus LTP, which may be associated with the transient lack of zinc release from zincergic neurons, seems to be involved in the impairment of the long-term memory </plain></SENT>
