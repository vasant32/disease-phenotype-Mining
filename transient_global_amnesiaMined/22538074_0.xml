<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether small <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> lesions can be detected more often by increasing the resolution of DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 31 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, 27 underwent DWI, twice at the first visit (range 1.5-22 hours; mean 10 hours) and at follow-up (range 50-87 hours; mean 72.5 hours) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each DWI included 2 different spatial resolutions with the same b-value (2000 seconds/mm(2)): conventional resolution in a 128 × 128 matrix with 3-mm section thickness and high resolution in a 220 × 220 matrix with 2-mm section thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number and contrast of hyperintense lesions were compared between the 2 resolutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 27 patients had single or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of lesions detected on conventional and high-resolution DWI was 11 and 22, respectively, at the first visit, and was 24 and 37, respectively, at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions was significantly larger on high-resolution DWI than on conventional resolution at the first visit (P &lt; .01) and at the follow-up (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesion contrast was significantly increased on high-resolution DWI (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher DWI resolution increased lesion detectability in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the small size of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> lesions, the resolution of DWI is an important parameter influencing lesion detectability </plain></SENT>
