<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is characterized by anterograde and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> without neurological deficits in which a temporal hypoperfusion is the most likely pathomechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible delay in the P3 latency in a cohort of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used classic oddball paradigms with visual and auditory stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P3 latencies were compared to 18 age-matched patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in the carotid artery territory and 23 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 60.1 years (SD 14.1), in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> group 64.7 (SD 12.1) and 57.7 (SD 10.1) in the controls; the mean time interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> symptoms and performance of P3 investigations was 4.3 days (range 1-7 days); and the mean latencies measured at the vertex (Cz electrode) were 422.9 ms (SD 44.6) for the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients, 436.4 ms (SD 62.1) for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> group, and 409.3 ms (SD 48.5) for the controls in the visual paradigm and 371.7 ms (SD 41.7), 399.7 ms (SD 51.2) and 385.3 ms (SD 46.5) in the auditory paradigm for the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P-values were not significant </plain></SENT>
