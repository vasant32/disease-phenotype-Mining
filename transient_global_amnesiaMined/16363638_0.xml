<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, in which diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image showed a punctuate hyperintense lesion in the left CA1 subfield of the hippocampus adjoining the lateral ventricle 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This lesion was observed with FLAIR image after 9 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and therefore was considered to be a delayed ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A SPECT and PET studies 7 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed a decrease of the CBF, CMRO2 and CMRglu, and was compatible with a delayed ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> nor abnormalities of vascular supply, and therefore the reason for microcirculatory disturbances remained unclear </plain></SENT>
