<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PDE-5 is found in high concentration in smooth muscle cells of the corpora cavernosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, enzymes of the PDE family are also expressed in various other tissues, including the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little is known about its effects on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>), although it has been suggested that PDE-5 inhibitors might cross the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Side effects, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, nasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, flushing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, are much more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) after his first-ever use of tadalafil, a potent PDE-5 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the aetiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> has not entirely been clarified at present, we consider the hypothesis of a causal relationship as tempting with respect to the current hypotheses of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case, together with others, suggests that PDE-5 inhibitors might be capable of exerting adverse effects in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware of the possibility of neurological disturbances when prescribing PDE-5 inhibitors for ED </plain></SENT>
