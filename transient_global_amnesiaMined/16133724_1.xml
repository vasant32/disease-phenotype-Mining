<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various events or activities have been shown to trigger <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these events is an increased sympathetic activity which in turn may be influenced by meteorological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to evaluate the influence of climatic parameters, and their variation on the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 223 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> admitted to our hospital over a six-year period were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study consisted of a comparison between the climatic parameters of days with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and those without <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The meteorological database included daily values of parameters recorded at the meteorological station of the town during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was significantly correlated with lower daily,monthly and seasonal temperature values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were found when the temperature was less than 6.9 degrees C,whereas the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was minimum when it was more than 24 degrees C (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only temperature had a significant independent effect: an increase of 1 sd = 8.4 degrees C decreases the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> admission odds of 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.62 to 0.97), i.e -22% (95 % CI: -38% to -3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> occurrence and low ambient temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multicentre studies taking into account climatic differences between countries are necessary to confirm our findings </plain></SENT>
