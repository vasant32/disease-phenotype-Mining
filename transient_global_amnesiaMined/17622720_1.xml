<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether these results reflect a true persistent damage or a simply too short assessment interval in the context of a prolonged recovery phase after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the cognitive long-term outcome, 16 patients who had suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> at a mean of 3 years before and 15 healthy controls underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between patients' and controls' cognitive performance were found, irrespectively of the analyzed neuropsychological domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore we hypothesize that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> usually does not cause persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> due to a generally transient and prognostic benign character </plain></SENT>
