<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this neuropsychological dissociation has rarely been examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While a few studies have assessed some components of working memory in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, the results that have been obtained are far from conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, we carried out a comprehensive investigation of working memory in 10 patients during a <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first study, we report the results from three patients examined with a battery of neuropsychological tests designed to assess each of the three subcomponents of Baddeley's model of working memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second study, seven different patients underwent neuropsychological investigations that focused specifically on the central executive system, using a protocol derived from a study by Miyake and colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed that subcomponents of working memory, such as the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketch pad, were spared in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific executive functions that entailed inhibitory control, dual task performance, updating and shifting mechanisms were also found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we found significantly impaired performance for the Brown-Peterson test, and that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients were significantly impaired in the recollection of their episodic memories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also made reduced numbers of 'remember' compared with 'know' judgments in the episodic memory test several days after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our findings, it would appear that the episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is not related to elementary aspects of executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data also highlight the nature of the cognitive mechanisms involved in the Brown-Peterson task, which may well depend on long-term memory (such as the process of semantic encoding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the selective deficit in recollective episodic memories observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> may be principally related to medial temporal lobe abnormalities that have been reported in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
