<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their performance was compared with that of a control group, matched for age, education, and profession </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that in spite of the common definition of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, impairments in both verbal and non-verbal long term memory and verbal fluency persisted and were in fact impaired to such a degree that it seemed unlikely that full recovery would have occurred within the next few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose a major role of stress in the etiology and the recovery process of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and consider it likely that stress hormones are of major influence both in the triggering of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and the subsequent continuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
