<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of CA1 neurons in the human hippocampus to the retrieval of episodic autobiographical memory remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>, highly focal lesions confined to the CA1 field of the hippocampus can be detected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of these lesions on autobiographical memory using a detailed autobiographical interview including the remember/know procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14 of 16 patients, focal lesions in the CA1 sector of the hippocampal cornu ammonis were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autobiographical memory was significantly affected over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time periods, including memory for remote periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impairment of episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness exhibited a strong temporal gradient extending 30 to 40 y into the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the distinct and critical role of human hippocampal CA1 neurons in autobiographical memory retrieval and for re-experiencing detailed episodic memories </plain></SENT>
