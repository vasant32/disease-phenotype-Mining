<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPALS: Most people enjoy sexual intercourse without complications, but a significant, if small, number need to seek emergency medical help for related health problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of these problems is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> admissions to our emergency department (ED) in direct relation to sexual intercourse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were collected prospectively and entered into the ED's centralised electronic patient record database (Qualicare, Switzerland) and retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The database was scanned for the standardised key words: 'sexual intercourse' (German 'Geschlechtsverkehr') or 'coitus' (German 'Koitus') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 445 patients were available for further evaluation; 308 (69.0%) were male, 137 (31.0%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 32 years (range 16-71) for male subjects and 30 years (range 16-70) for female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two men had cardiovascular emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>46 (10.3%) of our patients suffered from trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological emergencies occurred in 55 (12.4%) patients: the most frequent were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in 27 (49.0%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (12, 22.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (11, 20.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>154 (97.0%) of the patients presenting with presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> actually had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of the urogenital tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urethritis</z:e> (64, 41.0%), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystitis</z:e> (21, 13.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> (19, 12.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="std|stds">sexually transmitted disease</z:e> (STD) was diagnosed in 43 (16.0%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presenting with a presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>118 (43.0%) of the patients with a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> requested testing for an STD because of unsafe sexual activity without underlying symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sexual activity is mechanically dangerous, potentially infectious and stressful for the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because information on ED presentation related to sexual intercourse is scarce, more efforts should be undertaken to document <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such complications to improve treatment and preventative strategies </plain></SENT>
