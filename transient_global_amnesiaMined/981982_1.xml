<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Traumatic twilight state on the one and amnestic episode (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>) on the other side are as a rule easy to differentiate from the patient's age, his behavior during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> state of disease and the kind of its improving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrary to other authors' opinion, differentiation is not just possible by diagnosing an injury or its absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In minor skull traumata preceding the traumatic twilight states injuries are often not manifest and otherwise amnestic episodes occasionnally occur after minor traumata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a 64 years old woman an obviously typical amnestic episode appeared in direct connection with a probable fall on the back of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 28 years old man underwent a five-hour amnestic episode whereas the EEG showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The episode occurred 15 minutes after striking hard upon the ground with the back of the head during a ground roll without following unconsciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases traumatic twilight states were not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In account of the interval of 15 minutes the trauma of the second case seems not be be the direct cause for the manifestation of amnestic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also shows that the aspect of the disease in the rare occurrence in younger or middle-aged persons is on principle not different from that in old ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since a special medical examination during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> state is only possible as exception the patient's amnestically seizable behaviour obtains greatest importance in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the rare coincidence the trauma is given no pathogenetic relevance in amnestic episodes </plain></SENT>
