<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Observations obtained by psychopathologic examination and some psychologic testing of two patients in the course of amnesic episodes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo>) are presented and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases the psychopathologic findings are those of a reversible isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002625" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesic syndrome</z:e>, characterized by diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e>, whereas immediate and remote (personal) memory are preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stereotype questions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> in time, and--in one case--anxious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, which accompany the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002625" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesic syndrome</z:e>, are probably due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired memory</z:e> and the patient's awareness of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This typical syndrome allows differentiation of amnesic episodes from other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first case, which had been under clinical observation from the beginning to the end of the amnesic episode, a special evolution of the event could be ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amnesic episode reached its climax with a certain delay and thereafter decreased gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be presumed that--at least during the remission phase in the second case--the ability of recall is impaired rather than that of registration and retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other findings obtained in the second case--and compared with observations in the literature--point out that in the phase of remission the timespan of retrieval seems to become longer and, in respect to previously applied sensory modalities, improves in a different manner </plain></SENT>
