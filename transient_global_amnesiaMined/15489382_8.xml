<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the dynamic time course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>)--that is, the process of recovery and the interindividual variability--by testing four patients during the day of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> itself (on three occasions) and at follow up (on two occasions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A specially designed protocol focusing on semantic (both conceptual and autobiographical knowledge) and episodic (both anterograde and retrograde components) memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Every patient showed marked impairment of both anterograde and retrograde episodic memory during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, with a relative preservation of personal and conceptual semantic knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the following phase, the authors observed similarities and differences among the patients' patterns of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> recovered before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> and anterograde episodic memory was recovered gradually in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, shrinkage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> was more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of the patients, this shrinkage followed a chronological gradient and the most remote events were recovered first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the two other patients, it depended more on the strength of the trace, and there was no temporal gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the latter, an executive deficit could account for difficulties in accessing both conceptual knowledge and autobiographical memories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This profile of recovery suggests a "neocortical to medial temporal" process in every case, and the possibility of an additional frontal dysfunction in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase seems to be characterised by a common episodic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This variability between subjects appears in the recovery phase with two different patterns of impairment </plain></SENT>
