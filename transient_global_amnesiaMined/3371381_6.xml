<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major pathogenetic theories of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e>, thrombotic and migrainous) were investigated through the study of clinical histories and risk factors and the recurrences of neurological disturbances during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent of the sample had one or more thrombotic risk factors (TRF), 2 patients had both TRF and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and none ever experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed in 40 out of 55 patients to detect focal lesions: 3 patients (7.5%) had a lacuna in the deep structures of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the follow-up period, 1 patient died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>hepatic cirrhosis</z:hpo>, 1 patient died from cerebral haemorrhage, 2 patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> and 3 patients had a total of 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> represents a benign form of transient ischaemic cerebral disease </plain></SENT>
