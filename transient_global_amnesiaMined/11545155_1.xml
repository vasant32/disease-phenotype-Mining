<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was performed and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test was administered at 5 days and at more than a month after the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEG data on neuronal activity obtained while the patient was undertaking a working memory task and during rest were analyzed using the wavelet-crosscorrelation method, which reveals time-lag and information flow between related sites in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The WMS-R memory scores showed dramatic improvement when the test was administered a month following the attack, although no significant changes were observed in EEG, MRI and SPECT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MEG study revealed that under a working memory load how the neuron works functionally and the information propagates assembly within the right hemisphere, and that these brain functions were not performed adequately shortly after the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack </plain></SENT>
