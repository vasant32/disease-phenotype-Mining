<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>Transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> that consists in a sudden loss of anterograd memory and temporospatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> during less than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several precipitating factors have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional neuroimaging scans usually are negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different etiopathogenic theories have been postulated but the vascular etiology is the most commonly accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Three patients with a typical presentation of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> are studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them two brain blood flow HMPAO SPECT were performed, within the first 48 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and three months after as an evolutive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first patient showed a left temporal perfusion defect and temporoparietal hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second showed frontotemporal hypoperfusion, temporal mesial defect and hypoperfusion in basal ganglia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The third patient showed thalamic hyperperfusion and cerebellum hypoperfusion, both in the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them, control SPECT normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three etiopatogenic theories about <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> have been reported: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and blood flow impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> neuroanatomic image and neurophysiologic studies usually do not show significative alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversely, functional studies as brain blood flow HMPAO SPECT, do show changes being the most common bilateral temporobasal hypoperfusion, although this is not the only pattern described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Causes of this variable behaviour remain unclear but can be related to different clinic expressions and, over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, to time of evolution from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The three cases in this study show three different perfusion patterns reported in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them withhold the vascular etiopathogenic theory </plain></SENT>
