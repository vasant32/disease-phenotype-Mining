<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HMPAO SPECT was performed in six consecutive patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up SPECT was performed 3-20 wk later in four of the six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analysis of 14 regions of interest, including the basal ganglia and the basal section of the temporal lobes, was performed by comparing patient data with control data obtained from a matched group of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, unilateral or bilateral hypoperfusion of the temporo-basal region was observed in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variable hypoperfusion of further cortical areas was observed in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients who exhibited the most marked cortical hypoperfusion also showed striatal and thalamic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were normalized in the control studies obtained in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It remains unclear whether hypoperfusion during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> represents a primary feature or a sequel of regional brain hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because hypoperfusion is not confined to the temporo-basal region or to the territory of the posterior cerebral artery, it is suggested that the origin of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>-related changes lies at the level of subcortical structures that project diffusely to the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
