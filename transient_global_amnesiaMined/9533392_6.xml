<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are few clues as to the processes that underlie recovery of function from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence is offered from the perspective of a study of recovery of function during an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) that occurred as a complication of a cerebral angiographic procedure being carried out in a neurosciences centre, and where there was therefore a unique opportunity to examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to conduct the first quantitative study where shrinkage of anterograde and retrograde <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> was plotted at four separate intervals throughout the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recovery process, and also 24 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recovery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> preceded recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resolution of a naming deficit more closely paralleled recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> for public events, there was a temporal gradient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo>, with more recent events affected to a greater degree than earlier events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e>, picture recognition memory preceded recovery of story recall memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, and related observations in the published literature, it is proposed that recovery from some types of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, such as that associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, follows a 'lateral-to-medial' rule--lateral inferotemporal areas that play a major role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> recover first from hypometabolism related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> attack, followed by 'interface' areas such as the rhinal and parahippocampal cortices that are considered to have a role in both anterograde and retrograde memory functioning, with the last areas to recover physiological integrity being discrete limbic-diencephalic structures such as the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
