<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a Danish multicenter study, 74 patients 20 to 75 years of age (mean age, 58.8 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) without accompanying major neurological signs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over a follow-up period ranging from seven to 210 months (mean, 66.6 months) the observed rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular morbidity were similar to those expected in the Danish population, matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (22%) had further <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGAs</z:mp> occurring one month to nine years after the original episode; the mean annual recurrence rate was 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> without associated major neurological deficits is a benign clinical phenomenon, probably caused by a functional cerebral disturbance unrelated to cerebrovascular disease in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the observed temporal pattern of recurrence suggests that, although <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> is in principle a recurrent disorder, the annual risk of recurrence is so low that most of the elderly patients are likely to experience only one attack </plain></SENT>
