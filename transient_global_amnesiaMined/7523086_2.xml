<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Auditory and visual P300s were recorded during and after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> to investigate the contribution of the short-term memory system to P300 generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The auditory P300 during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was comparable to that recorded 1 week and 9 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the auditory modality, the visual target P300 was reduced in amplitude during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and at 1 week after the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P300 to novel visual stimuli was also reduced during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both target and novelty visual P300 recovered by 9 months after <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results support the notion that the neuronal networks responsible for P300 generation are modality dependent and that brain structures perfused by the posterior circulation are involved in visual P300 generation </plain></SENT>
