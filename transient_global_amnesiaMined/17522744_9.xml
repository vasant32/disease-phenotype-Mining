<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, recent studies have reported a high frequency of small high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus with diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been proposed as an etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> lesions occur preferentially in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, known to be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 30-month period 34 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> underwent MRI including DW imaging within 4 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus on the initial DW images underwent subsequent DW and T2-weighted imaging in the coronal plane to identify the precise lesion locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients had small (1-3 mm) high-signal abnormalities in the hippocampus unilaterally on DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these patients had two lesions in one hippocampus and therefore in total 15 lesions were identified: four in the hippocampal head, and 11 in the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven lesions in ten patients with available coronal images were clearly demonstrated on both coronal DW and T2-weighted images and were localized to the lateral portion of the hippocampus, corresponding to the CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lesions associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> were localized exclusively to the lateral portion of the hippocampus corresponding to the CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the ischemic etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>; however, the pathophysiological mechanism involved requires further study </plain></SENT>
