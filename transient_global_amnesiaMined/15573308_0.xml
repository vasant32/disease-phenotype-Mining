<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiopathogenesis of this syndrome remains unknown and different theories have been put forward about its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> or ischemic origin, or the relationship that exists with the neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> that is produced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of triggering factors have been described, including the taking of distinct pharmaceutical preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report the cases of two patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> who suffered <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> after taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4826">ergotamine</z:chebi> and dihydroergotamine, respectively, to treat an attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the vasoconstriction effect of these drugs, it was concluded that in both cases the main factor that triggered the <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was the ingestion of ergots </plain></SENT>
