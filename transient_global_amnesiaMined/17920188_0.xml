<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case reports involve two divers who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) immediately after surfacing from otherwise regular dives during which they had been breathing hyperoxic mixtures (Nitrox) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A wide spectrum of symptoms of neural dysfunction following hyperoxic mixtures have been reported, including cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> related to previous generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a review of the literature, however, we found no previous reports of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, which is very unlikely to result from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> mechanism, as an adverse effect of breathing hyperoxic mixtures </plain></SENT>
