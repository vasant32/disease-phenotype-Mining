<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They never represent the only type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pure amnestic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during which the only clinical manifestation is the patients' inability to retain in memory what occurs during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> coupled with the preservation of other cognitive functions and the ability to interact normally with their physical and social environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> result from selective ictal inactivation of mesial temporal (MT) structures without isocortical involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This occurs most often in patients with neuropsychological and electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence of bilateral dysfunction of MT structures (six out of eight patients in this study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the few patients without such evidence as well as in some with bilateral MT dysfunction, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> may result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> discharge limited to the MT structures of both temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the light of current anatomical knowledge, contralateral spread of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> discharge from the MT structures of one side to those of the other through the dorsal hippocampal commissure is the only likely explanation for this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One observation with depth electrode stimulation of MT structures supports this view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with evidence for bilateral MT dysfunction, a unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> may presumably suffice to induce a <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, the contralateral MT structures being unable to ensure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most instances <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> can be distinguished from episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
