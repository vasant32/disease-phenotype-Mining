<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since executive functions were spared, another dysfunction may be responsible for the binding and maintenance of multimodal informations and contribute to the encoding disorders observed in some patients [Quinette, P., Guillery, B., Desgranges, B., de la Sayette, V., Viader, F., &amp; Eustache, F </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this present study was to assess the functions of binding and maintenance of multimodal information during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and explore their involvement in episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025261" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a more thorough investigation of working memory in 16 new patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> using two tasks designed to assess the binding process and both dimensions of the maintenance, namely the active storage and the memory load ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the nature of the episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in distinguishing between the performance of patients with preferential encoding deficits and those of patients with preferential storage disorders on the episodic memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This distinction was closely related to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, i.e. an encoding disorder was observed rather in the early phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that while the functions of binding and maintenance of multimodal information were intact in patients with storage disorders, they were impaired in the case of encoding deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results are interpreted in the recent framework of episodic buffer proposed by Baddeley [Baddeley, A </plain></SENT>
