<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are contradictory data about the existence of long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is no consensus about which is the most suitable tool in order to use in the assessment of the follow up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess episodic memory of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients during amnesic episode and 7, 30 and 90 days after with free recall and Mini-Mental tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been measured patient's metamemory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and 17 healthy volunteers, matched by age, sex, and educational level were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal (four assessments) and factorial (patients and control group) study was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, free recall and Mini-Mental tasks were significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, only free recall task showed improvement along time and impairment after three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has been also detected that metamemory of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients is imprecise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comparing with control group, both free recall and Mini-Mental tasks have significant lower levels during <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, but only the first one is sensitive enough to show long-term disturbance associated with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
