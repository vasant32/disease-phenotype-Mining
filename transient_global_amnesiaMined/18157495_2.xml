<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyze the prevalence and characteristics of the main clinical and immunological manifestations in a cohort of patients with primary APS of mestizo origin from Latin America and to compare them with the European white patients, clinical and serological characteristics of 100 patients with primary APS from Colombia, Mexico, and Ecuador were collected in a protocol form that was identical to that used to study the "Euro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">Phospholipid</z:chebi>" cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cohort consisted of 92 female patients (92.0%) and eight (8.0%) male patients </plain></SENT>
