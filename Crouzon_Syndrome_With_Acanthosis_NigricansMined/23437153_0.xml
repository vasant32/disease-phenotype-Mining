<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the effect of this mutation on FGFR3 activation in HEK 293 T cells over a wide range of fibroblast growth factor 1 concentrations using a physical-chemical approach that deconvolutes the effects of the mutation on dimerization, ligand binding, and efficiency of phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the mutation increases FGFR3 dimerization, and our results verify this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, our results also demonstrate that the increase in dimerization is not the sole effect of the mutation, as the mutation also facilitates the phosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the activation loop of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activation of mutant FGFR3 is substantially increased due to a combination of these two effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low expression of the mutant, however, attenuates its signaling and may explain the mild phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>Acanthosis Nigricans</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results presented here provide new knowledge about the physical basis behind growth disorders and highlight the fact that a single RTK mutation may affect multiple steps in RTK activation </plain></SENT>
