<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the transmembrane (TM) domains of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been implicated in the induction of pathological phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations are believed to stabilize the RTK dimers, and thus promote unregulated signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the energetics behind the pathology induction has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An example of a TM domain pathogenic mutation is the Ala391--&gt;Glu mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>, as well as to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we determine the free energy of dimerization of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant FGFR3 TM domain in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayers using FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer, and we show that hydrogen bonding between Glu391 and the adjacent helix in the dimer is a feasible mechanism for dimer stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measured change in the free energy of dimerization due to the Ala391--&gt;Glu pathogenic mutation is -1.3 kcal/mol, consistent with previous reports of hydrogen bond strengths in proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first quantitative measurement of mutant RTK stabilization in a membrane environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that this seemingly modest value can lead to a large increase in dimer fraction and thus profoundly affect RTK-mediated signal transduction </plain></SENT>
