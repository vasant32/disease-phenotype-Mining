The effect of colchicine on mitoses of mutant HD33 Ehrlich-Lett≈ïe ascites cells growing in vivo and in vitro was studied. HD33 mouse ascites tumors are colchicine-resistant. The LD50 of colchicine in mice bearing HD33 ascites tumors was 1.4 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), but a single dose of 3.33 mg colchicine/kg b.w. failed to suppress the anaphase of HD33 tumor mitoses for 24 h. No change in the level of colchicine resistance was observed after 269 weekly transplantations of HD33 ascites tumors without colchicine. In suspension culture, growth of HD33 ascites cells ceased at 1.5 x 10(-6) M colchicine. 10(-5) M colchicine suppressed the anaphase of HD33 mitoses and produced typical C-mitoses within one hour. The same effects on mitoses of colchicine sensitive Ehrlich ascites cells in vitro were achieved with 10(-6) M colchicine. In HD33 ascites cell cultures grown without colchicine, only a slight increase in colchicine sensitivity was registered after 5 years. Parallel cultures were propagated for the same period in the presence of 10(-7) M colchicine (HD33C ascites cells) without detectable growth alterations; the resistance level increased slightly. The limit of 10(-6) M colchicine was tolerated by the ascites cells in permanent culture without growth reduction (HD33CS ascites cells). 3H-colchicine binding studies suggest a permeability barrier of the plasma membrane as a mechanism of genetically fixed resistance.
