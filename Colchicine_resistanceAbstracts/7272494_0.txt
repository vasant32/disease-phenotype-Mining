A new mouse cell line B-82CH(R)-9 is described, which is 25-fold more resistant to the cytotoxic action of colchicine than the known lines. The drug resistance of this cell line originates from the decreased plasmic membrane permeability. This follows from several facts: 1) 3H-colchicine uptake by intact resistant cells is decreased 5-10-fold; 2) the binding of labeled colchicine by extracts of resistant cells is unchanged; 3) colchicine resistant cells are cross-resistant to the drugs which are not active in binding the microtubular protein tubulin: the uptake of 3H-puromycin and 3H-cytochalasin B is decreased 2.1 and 2.5-fold, respectively. Unlike colchicine resistant mouse cell lines obtained earlier, the drug resistance of B-82CH(R)-9 cells is stable. After cultivation without a selective agent for 3 and 6 months the level of colchicine resistance remained unchanged.
