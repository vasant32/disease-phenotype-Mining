In the previous study we have found that Djungarian hamster fibroblasts with high levels of multidrug resistance (MDR) (colchicine-resistance index RI of 1000 to 42000) produce soluble factor(s) communicating MDR to the drug-sensitive cells of the same species by elevating the functional activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Here we have shown that these cells can influence human tumor cells in the same fashion. Rat hepatoma McA RH7777 cells and their colchicine-resistant derivatives are shown to produce a factor with similar effects (induction of MDR and Pgp functional activity in the drug-sensitive cells). These effects seem to depend on the drug resistance level of the donor cells. Our results show that induction of the Pgp-mediated MDR is not species-specific and the tumor cells with intrinsic MDR (arising from the tissue with a high level of Pgp expression) can produce a factor(s) communicating this type of drug resistance to the sensitive cells.
