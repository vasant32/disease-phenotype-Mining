We have studied amino acid up-take from incubation media by colchicine-resistant and colchicine-sensitive Djungarian hamster fibroblast cells. It has been shown that arginine and asparagine amino acid contents in the medium are different for colchicine-sensitive and colchicine-resistant cells. Amino acids concentration is not reduced in the medium after incubation of resistant cells, while it is decreased after incubation of sensitive cells. We can suggest that penetration of low-weight sources of nitrogen into sensitive cells is hampered. It can also be suggested that protein macromolecules are the main source of nitrogen for these cells. The protein up-take levels from the incubation medium, as assessed by the ammonia and amino acid contents of cell counts don't exceed 5% of their initial concentrations in the medium.
