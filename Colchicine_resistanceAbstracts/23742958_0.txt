AIM: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common recurrent autoinflammatory fever syndrome. Still, many issues-e.g.: colchicine dosage adjustment, maximum dosage of colchicine in children and adults, definition of colchicine resistance, alternative treatment solutions in colchicine-resistant patients, and genetic screening for asymptomatic siblings-have not yet been standardized. The current paper aims at summarizing consensus recommendations to approach these issues. METHODS: A literature review concerning these practical management questions was performed through PubMed. On the basis of this analysis, expert recommendations were developed during a consensus meeting of caregivers from France and Israel. RESULTS: A patient experiencing more than four FMF attacks a year needs colchicine dose adjustment. In case of persistent attacks (â‰¥6 per year) in patients with maximum doses of colchicine (2mg in children; 3mg in adults), alternative treatment to colchicine with IL1 inhibitors should be considered. Routine genetic testing for MEFV mutations in asymptomatic siblings of an index case is not recommended. CONCLUSION: This is a first attempt to resolve practical questions in the daily management of FMF patients.
