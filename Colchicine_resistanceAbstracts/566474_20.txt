Intraspecific hybrids of colchicine-sensitive with colchicine-resistant (CHR) Chinese hamster ovary cells were constructed, using six different colchicine-resistant clones from two independent series. In each instance, colchicine resistance was expressed in an incompletely dominant manner. Some hybrid clones were examined further for the expression of the pleiotropic CHR phenotype and for the cell surface P glycoprotein. These features of the colchicine-resistant phenotype were also expressed coordinately.
