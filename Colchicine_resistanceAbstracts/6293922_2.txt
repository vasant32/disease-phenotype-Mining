Small chromatin bodies (SCB) were revealed in Djungarian hamster cells resistant to colchicine. They looked like single bodies or like clusters of small particles. SCB were localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm. Similar formations were earlier observed in oocytes of insects with amplified extrachromosomal rDNA genes. DNA in the SCB was able to replicate not only during the S phase but also during other phases of the cell cycle. The restriction analysis showed that in cells with SCB DNA amplified sequences were replicated autonomously too. These data indicate that SCB in colchicine-resistant cells contain amplified genes. Besides, SCB double-minute chromosomes (DMs) were observed in some resistant sublines. In one of them, DMs were the only karyotypic alteration. The relationship between SCB, chromosomal homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) and DMs was studied. Single SCB and DMs appeared at the early stage of the development of colchicine-resistance (the level of drug resistance is 16-22). Selection of variants 170-220-fold resistant to colchicine was usually accompanied by the decrease in the cell number with SCB and DMs and by the increase in the amount of cells containing the chromosomes with HSRs. During the further enhancement of drug resistance (700-750), some decrease in the number of cells with HSRs and the appearance of the great number of cells containing large groups of SCB were found. The loss of colchicine-resistance observed during cultivation in colchicine free medium was accompanied by the disappearance of HSRs, emergence of SCB and DMs and further elimination of SCB and DMs from cells. The quantity of autonomously replicating amplified DNA fragments after digestive by HindIII was increased with the enhancement of SCB number in cultures.
