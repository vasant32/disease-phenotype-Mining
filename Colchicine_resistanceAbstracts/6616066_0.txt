The development of adriablastin resistance in Djungarian hamster DM-15 cells is accompanied by the appearance of small chromatin bodies (SCB) and long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) in the chromosomes--the structures that contained amplified genes. The pattern of karyotypic alterations (the appearance of additional chromosome 4, and emergence of SCB, formation of the HSRs in one of three of chromosome 4, transposition of the HSRs from chromosome 4 to other chromosomes) during the development of adriablastin resistance is identical to that found in these cells before, namely during the development of colchicine resistance. Adriablastin- and colchicine-resistant cells have similar changes in plasma membrane permeability for 3H-colchicine, 3H-actinomycin D, 3H-puromycin, 3H-cytochalasin B, and 3H-vinblastine. Apparently, adriablastin resistance has the same mechanism as colchicine resistance, being connected with gene amplification and decreased plasma membrane permeability for these drugs.
