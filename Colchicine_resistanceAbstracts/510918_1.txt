The studies of the high level of colchicine resistance of mouse L cells have shown that two mutagens (EMS and NMM) do not induce cell variants resistant to 8 microgram/ml of colchicine in the population of mouse heteroploid L-53 cells (subline of L cells, the level of colchicine resistance 140) and that colchicine resistance of L-53 cells gradually diminishes when cells are propagated in non-selective conditions: after 1 month it diminishes 2-fold, after 3 month--9-fold. The extent of the decrease of the drug resistance was the same in 6 independent cultures obtained from the inoculum of 200 cells and in control cultures propagated by large quantities of cells. These data coincide with the results of the previous studies of lower level of colchicine resistance. In both studies the frequency of the occurrence of colchicine resistant variants in selective medium was about 2.10(-4). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that colchicine resistance of mouse L cells is not due to a gene mutation.
