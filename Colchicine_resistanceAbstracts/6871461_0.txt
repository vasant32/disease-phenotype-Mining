Malignancy and anchorage independence of Djungarian hamster tumor cell lines resistant to different doses (0.1-5.0 micrograms/ml) of colchicine were studied. The clones with low colchicine resistance (15-20-fold) did not differ in tumorigenicity from parental cells. The TD50 for highly colchicine-resistant cells (200-800-fold) was several orders of magnitude higher than that for wild-type cells. Colchicine resistance did not affect the expression of the cells anchorage independence. The cloning efficiency in a semi-solid medium was the same both for colchicine-resistant cell lines and wild-type cells.
