The multidrug resistance gene-1 (MDR1, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter: ABCB1, P-glycoprotein) encodes membrane proteins that play a crucial role in protecting cells from xenobiotics, chemicals, and drugs. The TT genotype of 3435 codon in exon 26 of MDR1 gene causes overexpression of gene activity and effluxes many chemically diverse compounds across the plasma membrane. We studied the association between C3435T polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphism) of MDR1 gene and colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. Total genomic DNA samples from 52 FMF patients of colchicine unresponsiveness were used for FMF (MEFV) and MDR1 genes profile analyses. Target genes were genotyped by multiplex PCR-based reverse-hybridization Strip Assay method. The preliminary current results showed increased T allele frequency (0.596) in colchicine unresponsiveness of FMF patients. The distributions of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes in colchicine nonresponder FMF patients were 17%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. Our results indicate that C3435T polymorphism in exon 26 of MDR1 gene is associated with colchicine resistance in nonresponder FMF patients during the common therapy protocol.
