Cross-resistance to unrelated drugs has been previously observed in multidrug-resistant carcinoma cells and the goal of this work was to determine whether a similar mechanism existed in Entamoeba histolytica. An emetine and a colchicine-resistant clone, C2(90) (IC50 = 62 microM, and 1.5 mM, respectively), and the parental clone, A (IC50 = 5 microM and 1 mM, respectively), were analyzed for resistance to other drugs and for the effect of verapamil. Both clones, C2(90) and A, exhibited similar resistance to both daunomycin (IC50 = 50 microM) and actinomycin D (IC50 = 13 nM). In the presence of verapamil, the IC50 for emetine was reduced to 0.5 microM, while the IC50 for colchicine was reduced to 0.3 mM. These results demonstrate that verapamil reverses both emetine and colchicine resistance in the mutant C2(90). In uptake experiments with [3H]emetine, drug accumulation was lower in resistant trophozoites. However, in the presence of verapamil, drug accumulation was increased in clone C2(90) to a level close to that of the parental strain, clone A. These results are consistent with observations made using malaria and multidrug-resistant tumor cells and suggest that a P-glycoprotein-like molecule may play a role in drug resistance in E. histolytica.
