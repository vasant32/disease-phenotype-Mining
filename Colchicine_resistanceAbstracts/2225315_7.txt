The synthetic ether lipids ET-18-OCH3 and BM41.440 and a derivative, hexadecylphosphocholine, were tested for inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake into a Chinese hamster ovarian cell line (AUXBl) and its multidrug-resistant subline selected for colchicine resistance (CHRC5). The activity of all three compounds against the multidrug-resistant subline was equal to or higher than that against the parent line. The same result was found for their activity against a human leukemic lymphoblastic cell line (CEM/O) and its methotrexate-resistant subline (CEM/MTX). In contrast, two multidrug-resistant cell lines selected for resistance to Adriamycin, the mouse leukemia cell line P388/ADR and the murine sarcoma cell line S180/ADR, expressed modest cross-resistance to the lipids as measured by thymidine uptake. Experiments performed using the trypan-blue dye-exclusion assay yielded comparable results, although this system revealed a slightly different sensitivity in showing the cytotoxicity of the drugs. By this assay, modest cross-resistance for ET-18-OCH3 and BM41.440 to Adriamycin was found only after 24 h incubation and decreased after 48 h incubation, with almost equal sensitivity to both drugs being shown by the parental (P388/W) and resistant lines (P388/ADR). Furthermore, findings from a human tumor-cloning assay were in accordance with these data, although they did not indicate cross-resistance for the P388/ADR cell line. These results suggest that certain ether lipids and derivatives might represent valuable anticancer drugs warranting further study in the setting of resistant disease.
