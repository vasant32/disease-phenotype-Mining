The role of cellular interactions in the resistance of Djungurian hamster cells to colchicine (CH) and in the efficiency of P-glycoprotein function was studied. Mixtures of CH-resistant and CH-sensitive cells as well as control unmixed cells were propagated for 3 days and the sensitivity of the cells to CH was measured by colony forming assay. Identification of individual subpopulations was possible due to genetic marker (6TG-resistance). The data show that the survival of CH-sensitive cells in CH-supplemented medium increased after co-cultivation with CH-resistant counterparts. To measure Pgp activity the fluorescent dye RH123 and FACScan analysis were used. Pgp-mediated RH123 efflux increased after co-cultivation of CH-sensitive and CH-resistant cells.
