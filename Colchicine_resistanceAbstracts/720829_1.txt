The genetic nature of the resistance of mouse L cells to 0.06 microgram/ml of colchicine (the first step of selection) was studied. Fluctuation tests showed that the generation of drug-resistant variants in the wild type population was random and did not depend on the action of the selective agent. The rate of spontaneous occurrence of this variants was approximately 2 . 10(-5) per cell per generation. Colchicine resistance proved to be relatively unstable: it was 2--3-fold less in all clones propagated in non-selective conditions for 25--33 days. Two mutagens, ethylmethanesulphonate and N-nitroso-N-methylurea, failed to induce colchicine resistance in conditions when they enhanced the frequency of 8-azaguanine-resistant cells 10-fold.
