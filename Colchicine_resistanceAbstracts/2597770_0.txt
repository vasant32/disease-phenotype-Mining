Using a long-term selection the authors obtained the cells of a hamster with a rather high level of stability to colchicine (800-16,600 times). The nature of resistance of these cells to actinomycin differed from those having general origin with the newly obtained but having a lower level of stability to colchicine. This level of stability did not correlate with that to a selective agent.
