The series of sublines 170-750 times more resistant to colchicine were obtained from 10 independent clones of Djungarian hamster cells possessing 16-22-fold resistance to the drug. From each clone, several sublines with different levels of colchicine-resistance were developed. The drug resistance was unstable. 2,7-4,0% of cells per population doubling lost resistance to selective dosages of colchicine. The loss of resistance was stepwise. The chromosomes stained by trypsin G-banding technique were studied in 17 sublines. 15 sublines derived from 9 independent clones contained chromosomes with long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). These were, as a rule, primarily localized in the long arm of chromosome 4. During cultivation, HSRs were transferred from chromosome 4 into other chromosomes. Evidently, transposition of HSRs was due to translocations of different chromosomes of HSRs in the chromosome 4 and to subsequent breakages of the resulting dicentrics within HSRs. A great number of different chromosomal rearrangements was also found in the cells containing HSRs. Possibly, formation of HSR leads to destabilization of the karyotype and to the variability of the genome. The length of HSRs varied in different cells of each subline. The levels of colchicine-resistance in different sublines did not correlate with the average length of HSRs in their cells. The lack of connection between the lengths of HSRs and the levels of drug resistance as well as the existence of highly resistant sublines with gene amplification, but without HSRs, suggest that amplified genes are localized in Djungarian hamster colchicine-resistant cells both in chromosomes and extrachromosomally.
