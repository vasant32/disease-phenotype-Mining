BACKGROUND: Daily administration of rectal formulations of mesalazine is effective in preventing relapse of ulcerative proctitis. Maintenance of remission with lower doses would be an advantage. AIM: The efficacy of mesalazine suppositories (Pentasa) 1 g three times a week v placebo to maintain remission in patients with cryptogenetic proctitis was studied. METHODS: Ninety five patients with cryptogenetic proctitis were randomised within two weeks of remission to receive for one year or until relapse three suppositories per week of either Pentasa (n = 48) or placebo (n = 47). In the case of a relapse, the patients received one suppository/day. RESULTS: It was found that 25 of 48 subjects v 18 of 47 remained in remission in the mesalazine and placebo groups respectively. The relapse rate was lower in the mesalazine group for the following time intervals: 0-90 days (19% v 38%, p = 0.035), 0-180 days (29% v 54%, p = 0.017), 0-270 days (38% v 60%, p = 0.031), and 0-365 days (48% v 62%, p = 0.18). Treatment of relapse with one suppository/day induced remission in 11 of 18 and 2 of 26 patients in the mesalazine and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.001). Overall, 61% v 28% patients remained in the protocol and were in remission at one year (p = 0.001). Tolerance was good. CONCLUSION: Mesalazine suppositories 1 g three times a week are effective for preventing relapses of cryptogenetic proctitis. Increasing the dose to 1 g/day is effective in a high proportion of subjects who relapsed.
