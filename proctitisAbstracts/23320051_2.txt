Radiation proctitis is a frequent complication of pelvic radiation for cancer. This condition can present acutely within several weeks of radiation, or chronically many months or years after radiation, leading to rectal bleeding and transfusion-dependent anemia. Various medical and endoscopic therapies have been described to treat this condition; however, some patients fail to respond to the current standard therapies. Here we present a case of refractory radiation proctitis, with suboptimal response to other therapies, treated successfully with a novel method, radiofrequency ablation.
