Radiation colitis is a common consequence of pelvic radiation. Its complications may include anemia due to chronic bleeding requiring transfusions. Many of these patients are managed with rectal medications which are often inadequate for control. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) has been well described for its efficacy in treating radiation proctitis. Here we present two cases in whom APC therapy was used to treat severe radiation colitis. We reviewed two cases originally seen at the regional cancer center (Cross Cancer Institute) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Both patients received pelvic radiation for recurrent endometrial cancers and were referred for active bleeding secondary to radiation colitis that had required numerous transfusions. Radiation-induced telangiectasias were found from 10-50 cm in the sigmoid colon. Both patients had significant improvement of symptoms after one session of APC treatment set at 40-60 W and gas flow of 2.0 l/min. There were no complications from the procedures. Neither patient required blood transfusions after the treatment with improvement in their hemoglobin levels and were doing well at 3- and 6-month follow-up. APC can be used effectively to provide immediate and sustained resolution of symptoms in patients with radiation colitis.
