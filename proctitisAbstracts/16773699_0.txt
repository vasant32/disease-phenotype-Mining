Acute ischemic proctitis is a rare pathological condition. We report here a patient presented with massive rectal haemorrhage from a bleeding vessel superimposed on an underlying pathology of ischemic proctitis. This case report illustrates the difficulties in making the clinical distinction between ischemic proctitis and other pathological entities. We also discussed the beneficial role of arteriogram with embolotherapy as an effective therapeutic measure in the management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The literature on the subject is reviewed.
