 AIM: To study the incidence of ulcerative colitis UC in the prefecture of Trikala, Central Greece. METHODS: A prospective and population based epidemiological study of UC from 1990 to the end of 1994 was conducted. Trikala is a semirural prefecture of Central Greece with a population of 138 946 (census 1991). Three gastroenterologists (one hospital based, two private doctors) of the prefecture participated in this study. RESULTS: During the study period, 66 new histologically verified cases of UC were recorded. The mean annual incidence of the disease in 1990-1994 was 11.2 per 10(5) inhabitants (95%CI: 8.7-14.3). There was no difference between men and women (annual incidence: 10.5 and 12.0 per 10(5) inhabitants respectively), either among urban, semirural or rural populations (annual incidence: 11.7, 17.1 and 9.9 per 10(5) inhabitants respectively). The majority (56%) of the patients never smoked and a quarter were ex-smokers. About a half of all cases had proctitis. CONCLUSION: UC is common in Central Greece and its incidence is similar to that in North-Western European countries.
