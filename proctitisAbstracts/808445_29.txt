The effect of topical disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) has been examined in 30 patients with chronic active proctitis using a double-blind crossover trial. Each treatment period was four weeks and patients were given DSCG 200 mg by enema twice daily and 100 mg orally three times each day. Twenty-six patients completed the trial successfully, 14 responded to DSCG treatment, two improved with placebo, and 10 responded to neither. Patients who responded to DSCG had significantly more eosinophils in their rectal biopsies than those who failed to respond and in some instances the counts were very high. The findings support the hypothesis than an allergic reaction is important in the pathogenesis of proctitis.
