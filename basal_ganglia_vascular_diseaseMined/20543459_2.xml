<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a detailed analysis of the cognitive phenotype associated with ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is key to our understanding of subcortical neuropathology and its associated behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the past twenty years, we have operationally defined this cognitive phenotype using the Boston Process Approach to neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has led to both an empirical, as well as a theoretical understanding of three core constructs related to the dysexecutive syndrome associated with ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> affecting periventricular and deep white matter as well as subcortical structures connecting these regions with the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, difficulties with mental set, cognitive control and mental manipulation negatively impact executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will outline the subtle markers underlying this prefrontal dysfunction, i.e., the dysexecutive phenotype, associated with ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and relate it to fundamental impairments of gating subserved by basal ganglia-thalamic pathways within and across various <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
