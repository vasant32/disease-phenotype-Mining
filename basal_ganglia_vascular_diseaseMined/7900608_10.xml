<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the causes of infantile lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) as demonstrated by sonography and propose the pathogenesis of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred eighty-six infants were examined via echoencephalography because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, dysmorphism, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, bulging of anterior fontanel, consciousness disturbance, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We directed our attention on the sonographic study to the basal ganglionic and thalamic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of the 586 patients underwent color Doppler studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 34 infants with gray-scale neurosonographic findings of LSV, 16 were associated with various causes that have been reported before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients entities not previously associated with LSV were found: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal lupus</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, and head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 10 cases, a specific cause could not be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LSV was found in 16 (40%), 5 (14%), and 13 (3%) patients with perinatal, acquired, and nonspecific causes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Generally, this is an uncommon finding because it was observed in only 34 (5.8%) of the study infants; 24 of these 34 had a documented cause of the vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With LSV associated with perinatal causes there was a greater chance of sonographic LSV's developing than with that of acquired causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that sonographic LSV is a nonspecific marker of a previous insult to the developing brain, and the special hemodynamics of the fetal brain plays an important role in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
