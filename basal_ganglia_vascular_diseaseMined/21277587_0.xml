<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in intracranial branch atheromatous disease (BAD) is different from large artery atherothrombotic disease (LAD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LACI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concept of BAD is underused in clinical practice and research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients admitted over 24-months with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> caused by atherosclerotic disease were reviewed retrospectively and classified according to radiologicalÂ±clinical criteria into LAD, BAD and LACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BAD cases were further divided into 5 BAD syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, vascular risk factors, results of vascular workup and outcome among these subgroups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 123 cases of LAD (17% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients or 33% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied patients), 147 BAD (20% or 40%) and 102 LACI (14% or 27%) presented during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to LAD, BAD patients had milder neurological deficits, were less often diabetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was less common, while stenosis of the intracranial arteries was more frequent in BAD as compared with LACI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome in BAD patients was intermediate between LAD and LACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons among the BAD syndromes indicated they were homogenous conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAD is the most prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The homogeneity among the BAD syndromes suggests they might represent a distinctive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> entity </plain></SENT>
