<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the aetiopathogenetic sign, the majority of the patients appeared to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thromboangiitis obliterans</z:e>, non-specific aortoarteritis, primary and secondary vasculopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were age- and sex-matched and well comparable by the underlying disease, the level of lesions of the vascular bed, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was performed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of three options of preoperative preparation and management of the postoperative period were used: option one - treatment comprising plasmapheresis, immunoglobulins and biological immunomodulators; option two - using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> agents and hormone therapy; and option three - consisting of conventional basic vascular therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis performed demonstrated a clear advantage of immunocorrection and efferent techniques of treating patients presenting with the pathology concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of the therapeutic-and-diagnostic algorithm we are suggesting herein would make it possible to avoid complications in the immediate postoperative period, to reduce the duration of the patients' hospital stay averagely by 10 days, and to prolong persistence of the obtained positive results by 11.5% </plain></SENT>
