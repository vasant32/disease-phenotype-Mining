<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a role for the basal ganglia-brainstem system in the control of motor behaviors and in the regulation of awake-sleep states has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purported roles of these structures may be relevant in explaining the occurrence of the RLS in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discrete brain localization observed in this patient may be a clue to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS and PLM </plain></SENT>
