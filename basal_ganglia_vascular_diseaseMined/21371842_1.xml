<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Being a multimodality imaging method, it combines in a single session the sensitivity granted by PET for detection of molecular targets within the picomolar range, with an underlying submilimetric resolution inherent to CT, that can precisely localize the PET findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this last decade, there have been new insights regarding the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, particularly about plaque rupture and vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has increased the interest for research on PET/CT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> as a potential new diagnostic tool, since some PET molecular targets could identify diseases before the manifestation of gross anatomic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will describe the current applications of PET/CT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, emphasizing its usefulness in the settings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular graft infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>/plaque vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not being properly peripheral vascular conditions, ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease will be briefly addressed as well, due to their widespread prevalence and importance </plain></SENT>
