<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has emerged as the treatment of choice for small- to medium-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) in deep locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to investigate the outcomes of GKS for <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> in the basal ganglia and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 85 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> in the basal ganglia and 97 in the thalamus underwent GKS and were followed up for more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nidus volumes ranged from 0.1 to 29.4 cm(3) (mean 3.4 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean margin dose at the initial GKS was 21.3 Gy (range 10-28 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients underwent repeat GKS for residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> at a median 4 years after initial GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean margin dose at repeat GKS was 21.1 Gy (range 7.5-27 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following a single GKS, total obliteration of the nidus was confirmed on angiograms in 91 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients (6.6%) a subtotal obliteration was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No flow voids were observed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in 14 patients (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following single or repeat GKS, total obliteration was angiographically confirmed in 106 patients (58.2%) and subtotal obliteration in 8 patients (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No flow voids on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging were observed in 18 patients (9.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall obliteration rates following one or multiple GKSs based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging or angiography was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A small nidus volume, high margin dose, low number of isocenters, and no history of embolization were significantly associated with an increased rate of obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients experienced 25 episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 850 risk-years following GKS, yielding an annual <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate of 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four patients died in this series: 2 due to complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 2 due to unrelated diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Permanent neurological deficits caused by radiation were noted in 9 patients (4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers a reasonable chance of obliterating basal ganglia and thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and does so with a low risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is an optimal treatment option in patients for whom the anticipated risk of microsurgery is too high </plain></SENT>
