<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Congenital infections</z:e> are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, including lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between LSV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infections</z:e>, as diagnosed by TORCH serology and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> culture for cytomegalovirus (CMV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> neonates with LSV admitted to our neonatal intensive-care unit from 2004 to 2008 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of maternal and neonatal TORCH testing were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, cranial ultrasound scans were performed in 2,088 neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LSV was detected in 80 (4%) neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal and/or neonatal serological TORCH tests were performed in 73% (58/80) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the mothers or infants (0 of 58) had positive IgM titres for Toxoplasma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rubella</z:e>, CMV or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional urine culture for CMV was performed in 38 neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the infants (0 of 38) had a positive CMV urine culture test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routinely applied efforts to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infections</z:e> in cases presenting with LSV have a poor yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Routine TORCH screening in neonates with LSV cases should only be regarded as mandatory once well-designed studies demonstrate a clear diagnostic benefit </plain></SENT>
