<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of both tools is compared for findings obtained around term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Periventricular echodensities and intraventricular haemorrhage were the most frequent cUS findings during admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequent findings on both cUS and MRI around term included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, widened extracerebral spaces, and decreased cortical complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI additionally showed punctate white matter lesions and diffuse and excessive high signal intensity, but did not depict lenticulostriate vasculopathy and calcifications, and was less reliable for germinolytic and plexus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cUS detected most abnormalities that have been associated with abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome </plain></SENT>
