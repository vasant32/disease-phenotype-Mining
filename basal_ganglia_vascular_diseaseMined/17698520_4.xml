<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the role and range of abnormalities seen on cUS in neonates presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim, when possible, was to address the question of whether brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is more informative by comparing cUS to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neonates with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> who had at least 1 cUS scan were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cUS images were reviewed for anatomic and maturation features, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, calcium, and other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging scan had been obtained, both sets of images were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five infants (35 also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent findings were in oxidative phosphorylation disorders (21 cUS and 12 MR imaging): ventricular dilation (11 cUS and 6 MR imaging), germinolytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (GLCs; 7 cUS and 5 MR imaging), and abnormal white matter (7 cUS and 6 MR imaging); in peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (13 cUS and 9 MR imaging): GLCs (10 cUS and 6 MR imaging), ventricular dilation (10 cUS and 5 MR imaging), abnormal cortical folding (8 cUS and 7 MR imaging), and lenticulostriate vasculopathy (8 cUS); in amino acid metabolism and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle disorders (14 cUS and 11 MR imaging): abnormal cortical folding (9 cUS and 4 MR imaging), abnormal white matter (8 cUS and 8 MR imaging), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002079'>hypoplasia of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> (7 cUS and 6 MR imaging); in organic acid disorders (4 cUS and 2 MR imaging): periventricular white matter echogenicity (2 cUS and 1 MR imaging); and in other disorders (3 cUS and 1 MR imaging): ventricular dilation (2 cUS and 1 MR imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>cUS findings were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>cUS was better for visualizing GLCs and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was more sensitive for subtle tissue signal intensity changes in the white matter and abnormality in areas difficult to visualize with cUS, though abnormalities of cortical folding suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo> were seen on cUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A wide range of abnormalities is seen using cUS in neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>cUS is a reliable bedside tool for early detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, calcium, structural brain abnormalities, and white matter echogenicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
