<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: If the pattern of neonatal lenticulostriate vasculopathies (NLSV) is well-known, the prognosis is unknown except in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270173" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">TORCH syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to describe the short, mid and long-term outcome of NLSV of various origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>POPULATION AND METHODS: Of 9138 neonates (1981-2000) which were submitted to an early brain ultrasound study, 70 presented with a pattern of minor (35), moderate (27) or severe (8) NLSV, a single finding in 42 cases and in association with minor peri-intraventricular haemorrhage and/or leukomalacias in 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maternal and neonatal charts were reviewed, and the survivors were followed according to our usual policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, eight cases included severe congenital defects (metabolic or malformations or acquired: transfused monochorial twins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 61 survivors, eight were lost to follow-up within the first year, 53 were followed for 21 months to 9 years and 7 months (median 4 years 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 53 children, 35 (66%) were strictly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, eight had minor deviations, four had moderate and six had major neurodevelopmental deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 34 survivors with isolated NLSV and known follow-up, 27 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (79%) versus 8/19 (42%) in associated NLSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minor or moderate isolated NLSV generally have a good long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associated forms of any severity depend mainly upon the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major forms of NLSV must be a warning sign of a possible underlying congenital anomaly which will rule the vital and functional prognosis </plain></SENT>
