<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tried to elucidate clinical and other properties of DSBI to understand better in pathophysiology of ischemic lesion of basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion of basal ganglia with the size varying from 1.5 to 3 cm in maximal diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical features, laboratory data, risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and radiologic findings such as MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with DSBI could be largely divided into two distinctive groups, small infarction with cortical sign (SICS) and lacunar syndrome (LS) according to their presence of cortical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total of 11 patients were in SICS group and they showed cortical manifestations such as eyeball deviation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also showed severer non-cortical neurologic deficit compared with LS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas LS group showed various MRA patterns, 7 patients of SICS group (63.6%) showed proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that many patients with DSBI could have the features of either lacune or striatocapsular infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although they have similar morphologic characteristics but they are presumed to have different pathophysiologic mechanism </plain></SENT>
