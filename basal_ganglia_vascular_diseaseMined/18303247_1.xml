<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002333'>motor deterioration</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e>) in deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> is usually associated with long-term functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics, biochemical markers and MRI variables in patients with deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> to identify the predictors of progressive motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 167 consecutive patients with deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> in the anterior circulation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients must have motor deficit as one of the presented symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> was defined as a modified National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (mNIHSS) motor score of &gt;or=1 during the first week of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were assessed with clinical findings such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, blood pressure on admission, laboratory variables and radiological findings; lesion characteristics on MRI, stenosis or occlusion in the relevant parental artery on MRA and diffusion/perfusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three (13.8%) of the 167 patients revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The independent factors related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> in multiple regression analysis were initial high systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.035, 95% CI = 1.007-1.063; p = 0.013) and lesion involvement in the posterolateral striatum (OR = 15.98; 95% CI = 1.842-138.534; p = 0.012); however, the other clinical and radiological factors were not related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the posterolateral striatum appears to be an important predictor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be explained by (1) the lateral lenticulostriate artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>), which supplies the posterolateral striatum vulnerable to ischemic damage due to the lack of collateral vessels, and (2) the posterolateral division of the striatum may be susceptible to progressive motor deficit because of anatomic proximity to the corticospinal tract in the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research should include precise anatomical and functional study to determine the relationship between the posterolateral striatum and corticospinal tract in predicting progressive motor deficit </plain></SENT>
