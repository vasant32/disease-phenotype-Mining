<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a positive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> response in vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP) is correlated with the presence of nigrostriatal pathology due to either vascular damage or neuronal cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with pathologically confirmed VP were selected from the pathological collection of the Queen Square Brain Bank for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e>, and their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> response during life was compared with the presence of macroscopic vascular damage in the nigrostriatal pathway and microscopic substantia nigra cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the twelve patients with a good or excellent response had macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or lacunae caused by enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia or microscopic neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one of the five patients with a moderate or no response had lacunae in the putamen, and none had lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or substantia nigra cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a substantial number of patients with clinically suspected VP may respond with benefit to dopaminergic therapy, especially those with lesions in or close to the nigrostriatal pathway </plain></SENT>
