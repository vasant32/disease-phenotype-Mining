<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we quantitatively examined the lenticulostriate arteries in hypertensive patients using ultrahigh-field 7T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the number of stems and branches, curvature, and tortuosity of the lenticulostriate arteries by 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography among 20 hypertensive patients (mean age: 46.6+/-9.1 years) and 20 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age: 47.7+/-8.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average numbers of stems and branches in hypertensive patients were significantly less than those of healthy subjects (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was abolished in older volunteers (&gt;45 years old), whereas the difference between young hypertensive patients (&lt; or = 45 years old) and age-matched healthy controls was augmented by 55% for stems and 91% for branches (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison, there were no differences in the average curvature and tortuosity of the lenticulostriate arteries and no significant difference when corrected for smoking (P=0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results showed that there was a substantial difference in the lenticulostriate arteries of hypertensive patients compared with healthy individuals when observed in vivo by ultrahigh-resolution 7T magnetic resonance angiography, and the difference was considerable in young subjects </plain></SENT>
