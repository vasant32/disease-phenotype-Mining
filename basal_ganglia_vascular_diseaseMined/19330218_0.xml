<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate, through an immunohistochemical method, whether there is deposition of plasma proteins in the wall of lenticulostriate, cortical and leptomeningeal arteries of hypertensive patients, with and without lipohyalinosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were selected at random, 20 with lipohyalinosis in the lenticulostriate arteries (HH group) and 20 without lipohyalinosis (H group), matched with 20 normotensive controls (C group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma protein deposits were identified in eight patients (40%) in the C group, in 15 patients (75%) in the H group, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients (100%) in the HH group, the difference being significant for the H group and highly significant for the HH group, as compared with the C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, the distribution of plasma protein deposits, subendothelial in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries, and diffuse, irregular in the wall of arteries with lipohyalinosis, was more frequent in the lenticulostriate arteries of the putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deposition of plasma proteins in the lenticulostriate arteries seems to be relatively frequent in normotensive individuals, starting in middle age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such process appears to be intensified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, especially in individuals with lipohyalinosis </plain></SENT>
