<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent studies, bright linear echogenesitis in these regions have been well decribed and were defined as lentriculostriate vasculopathy (LSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These lesions suggested as a marker of a previous insult to the fetal or neonatal brain and the hemodynamics in the immature brain play an important role in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a period of 2 year and 5 months, we collected 39 cases of neonates and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurities</z:e> with LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include 16 cases of premature babies, 16 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> full-term neonates and 7 cases with perinatal insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LSV was detected incidentally in most cases, distinctly different from the previous reports that LSV are linked with congenital anomaly, chromosomal anomaly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, perinatal insult or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infection</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 7 days) LSV in 23 cases (59%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> (&gt;7 days) in 16 cases (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>16 cases (41%) had total remission, 7 cases (18%) had partial remission, and 16 cases (41%) remained persistantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rare reports remined of the long term effect of LSV including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100033'>tics</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> disorder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An isolated LSV generally has a good long term prognosis and a grave neurologic deficit may be mainly due to its associated brain damage </plain></SENT>
