<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gait variability is an index of how much gait parameters, such as step length, change from one step to the next </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gait variability increases with age and in individuals affected by cortical and subcortical neurodegenerative conditions, and it is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and incident mobility disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain anatomical correlates of gait variability have not been studied in high-functioning community-dwelling older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gait variability and brain MRIs were assessed in a cohort of 331 men and women (mean age = 78.3 years) free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gait variability was computed for spatial parameters (step length and step width) and for temporal parameters (stance time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subclinical brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were measured on brain MRIs as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Greater variability of step length was associated with greater prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia, and with greater white matter hyperintensities severity, independent of age, gender, cognitive function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weaker associations were found between the other variability measures and the MRI measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this group of older adults free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, a greater variability of step length was associated with greater burden of subclinical brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> as defined by MRI </plain></SENT>
