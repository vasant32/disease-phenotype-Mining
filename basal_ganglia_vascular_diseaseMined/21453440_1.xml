<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand and seventy-seven healthy individuals examined by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were divided into eight subgroups according to our new classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that healthy individuals with incompleteness of the anterior circle of Willis had significantly higher frequency of lacunes [odds ratio (OR): 2.121, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.477-3.108; or OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.377-4.384 in cases without or with fetal type posterior communicating artery, respectively] and higher numbers of lacunes (P &lt; 0.001 or P &lt; 0.001 in cases without or with fetal type posterior communicating artery, respectively) compared to patients with complete circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incompleteness of the anterior part of the circle of Willis significantly affected the occurrence of lacunes </plain></SENT>
