<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique was used with an investigational 7.0-T MRI scanner with a radio-frequency coil that was optimized and designed for angiographic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained images from 16 healthy volunteers (8 males and 8 females, mean age 21 +/- 2.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For direct comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> images with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), we also obtained 7.0-T MRA and DSA images from one patient, a 27-year-old woman with a posterior fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then analyzed the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> using a custom data analysis method with MatLab for quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> images included shape and number of branches and origins, findings that are essential and useful for quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> abnormalities in both healthy controls and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultra-high-field MRA provided clear anatomic delineation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e>, thereby suggesting that 7.0-T MRA may be a promising technique for microvascular imaging of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
