<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many symptomatic cavernous malformations deep in the anteroinferior basal ganglia are deemed to be inoperable and managed conservatively because transcortical, transsylvian-transinsular, and transcallosal approaches are unsuitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present an approach to these lesions through the supracarotid triangle, between ascending perforators, and through the basomedial frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The supracarotid-infrafrontal approach incorporates an orbitozygomatic craniotomy, wide microsurgical exposure of the supracarotid triangle, dissection of perforating arteries, and image-guided resection through the posterior part of the medial orbital gyrus and anterior perforated substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 10 years of surgical experience with 269 patients with cavernous malformations, 5 patients were identified with lesions in the basal ganglia that were resected completely using the supracarotid-infrafrontal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient neurological deficits were observed postoperatively in 2 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had excellent outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1; mean duration of follow-up, 1.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cavernous malformations in the anteroinferior basal ganglia come to the brain surface directly behind the internal carotid artery bifurcation, and the supracarotid-infrafrontal trajectory best matches the lesions' axes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical corridor runs between perforating arteries, but entrance into these lesions opens additional working space that is not normally present when the approach is used with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Careful handling of crossing and ascending perforating arteries is critical, as is delicate dissection of the lesion's superior pole where it abuts the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
