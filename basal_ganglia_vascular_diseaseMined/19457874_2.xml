<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess for lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) on cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans of very <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e>: incidence and aetiology, evolution during neonatal period, association with clinical parameters, and MRI equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary neonatal referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Very <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> (&lt;32 weeks) underwent sequential cUS throughout the neonatal period and MRI around term age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cUS were evaluated for LSV and other changes, and MRI for changes in signal and myelination in deep grey matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LSV was divided into early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt;or=7 postnatal days) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (&gt;7 postnatal days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perinatal clinical parameters were collected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants and compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 22/111 (20%) infants LSV was detected: early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 5 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LSV mostly presented some weeks after birth and persisted for several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between LSV and other changes on cUS or deep grey matter changes on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> LSV were younger and smaller at birth than infants with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postmenstrual age at first detection was comparable for both LSV groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between LSV and perinatal clinical parameters, but infants with LSV had less episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> than infants without LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LSV is a frequent finding on cUS in very <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e>, but does not show on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The postmenstrual age, rather than gestational and postnatal age, seems important in LSV development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LSV is not associated with clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When encountered in otherwise healthy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e>, LSV is probably a benign temporary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
