<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) are the two major diseases that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and early diagnosis is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is used for the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and as an auxiliary method for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AD shows reduced posterior blood flow and VaD manifests reduced anterior blood flow on CBF SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the usefulness of 3D fractal analysis of CBF SPECT images to objectively quantify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF in patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AD and 22 with VaD based on neuropsychologic tests and imaging findings, as well as 20 age-matched control subjects underwent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethyl propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> CBF SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then conducted statistical image processing by 3D fractal analysis on reconstructed data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractal dimension, an index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, was then calculated for the whole brain, as well as for the anterior and posterior regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher fractal dimension indicates that the CBF SPECT image is uneven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of fractal dimension of the anterior region to fractal dimension of the posterior region (A/P ratio) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF was compared among the AD, VaD, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fractal dimensions of the AD, VaD, and control groups were 1.072+/-0.179 (mean +/- SD), 1.005+/-0.156, and 0.806+/-0.06, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant difference of fractal dimension was noted between the control group and the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (P&lt;.0001); however, no significant difference was noted between the AD and VaD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The A/P ratios of the AD and VaD groups were significantly different (0.952 and 1.163, respectively; P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Analysis of CBF SPECT images quantitatively showed that the fractal dimension was significantly higher (indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) in patients with AD and VaD when compared with age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the A/P ratio on CBF SPECT images between AD and VaD groups showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF was posterior-dominant for AD and anterior-dominant for VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, 3D fractal analysis enabled a simple and objective evaluation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CBF in patients with AD and VaD </plain></SENT>
