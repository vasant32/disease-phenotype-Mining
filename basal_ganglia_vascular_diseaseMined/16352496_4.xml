<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Advances in diagnostic testing and surgical techniques have resulted in reduced mortality in neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) and a major concern for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> in the presence of preoperative neurological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and nature of preoperative cerebral ultrasound abnormalities in neonates with major CHD and to examine the relationship between cerebral abnormalities and the type of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study; inclusion criteria: (1) neonates with major CHD admitted to the NICU over a 3-y period, (2) gestational age &gt;35 wk, (3) documented preoperative cranial ultrasound available; exclusion criteria: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other congenital anomalies</z:e> and/or chromosomal abnormalities, (3) a 5-min Apgar score &lt;7, (4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cranial ultrasounds (CUS) were reviewed without knowledge of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHDs were categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty of 108 neonates with CHD met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (42%) had abnormalities on CUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these (26%) had widened ventricular and/or subarachnoid spaces, three (6%) lenticulostriate vasculopathy, one (2%) calcification in the basal nuclei, and four (8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral abnormalities occurred more frequently in patients with coarctation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004383'>hypoplastic left heart</z:hpo> syndrome (HLHS) than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) (63% vs 14%; n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of preoperative cerebral ultrasound abnormalities in this group of neonates with major CHD </plain></SENT>
