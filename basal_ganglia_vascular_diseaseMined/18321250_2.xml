<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though the pathogenesis of neuronal damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperargininemia</z:e> is not clear, high serum and cerebrospinal fluid arginine levels can be directly related with neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, our aim was to assess brain magnetic resonance images and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) patterns of two siblings with hyperarginenemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We acquired single voxel MRS from the white matter to show the myelination pattern and to figure out any abnormal peak of metabolite stored due to enzymatic defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed mild cerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001272'>cerebellar atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at bilateral posterior putamen and insular cortex localization on conventional images and elevated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratios and abnormal peak at 3.8 ppm, most likely representing arginine deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article revealing the brain MRS pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperargininemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We reported the clinical and imaging findings of patients and discuss the correlation </plain></SENT>
