<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illnesses who reside at home, however, require care that is holistic and focuses on wellness rather than illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) patients are the largest group receiving home nursing care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They qualify for reimbursement under NHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to quantify the home health care (HHC) needs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients and to understand predictors for HHC services for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A descriptive correlation design was used to examine the relationship between a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patient's health status and the need for HHC services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 195 patients were interviewed by one trained research assistant, with 124 patients being from Taipei (an urban area in Taiwan) and the remaining 71 from I-lan (a rural area in Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of subjects was 74.8 years, with 60% of the sample being female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physiological health status scores (M = 2.56, SD = 0.58, range = 1-5) were worse than the psychosocial health status scores (M = 2.37, SD = 0.91, range = 1-5), which indicates that the need for health education and skilled nursing services was higher than referral services for professional HHC services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that there is a need to develop and shape NHI policy to cover more holistic HHC services for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
