<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variety of fluent and nonfluent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasias</z:hpo> have been reported after left basal ganglia <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may reflect variations in cortical hypoperfusion resulting from large vessel stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, a consecutive series of 24 patients with left caudate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> identified with diffusion-weighted imaging underwent language testing and perfusion-weighted imaging &lt; 24h from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific regions in perisylvian cortex were rated for the percentage of the region that was hypoperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> type was determined on the basis of speech fluency, comprehension, and repetition performance on the language tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> type/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> and regions of hypoperfusion were identified with Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left caudate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the presence and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> reflected regions of hypoperfusion, and generally followed predictions based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion studies, regarding anatomical lesions associated with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
