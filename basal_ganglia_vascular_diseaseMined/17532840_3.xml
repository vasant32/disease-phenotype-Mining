<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study investigated the survival and natural history of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 in a series of patients, comparing the management and outcome before and after the implementation of Taiwan's National Health Insurance program (NHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 28 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 seen at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, from 1985 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival and management before (12 cases) and after (16 cases) the implementation of National Health Insurance were compared, and structural defects, imaging findings, and cytogenetic results were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases that were diagnosed prenatally, and finally terminated, were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 was based on the postnatal chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 translocation died in their first year because of severe malformations of the cardiovascular or central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After implementation of National Health Insurance, survival with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 was significantly longer than before (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three most common structural defects were abnormal auricular helices or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000369'>low-set ears</z:hpo> (89%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> and abnormal scrotum of male (73%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using echocardiography, the most commonly detected heart defects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> (68%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (50%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (50%), and eight cases (36%) had complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common brain lesion was lenticulostriate vasculopathy (22%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001360'>holoprosencephaly</z:hpo> (17%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (13%) and subependymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and the survival patterns from the data collected should be used to inform parents and health-care professionals to assist in decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although most patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 die within the first weeks after birth, it is important to recognize that a few may survive the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When counseling families, the long-term survival prospects of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 patients should be included </plain></SENT>
