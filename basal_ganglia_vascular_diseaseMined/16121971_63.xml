<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of cultured neuronal cells has been shown to be safe and effective in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and safe in a Phase 1 human trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the authors tested the usefulness of human neuron transplantation followed by participation in a 2-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation program compared with rehabilitation alone in patients with substantial fixed motor deficits associated with a basal ganglia <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human neuronal cells (LBS-Neurons; Layton BioScience, Inc.) were delivered frozen and then thawed and formulated on the morning of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entry criteria in this randomized, observer-blinded trial of 18 patients included age between 18 and 75 years, completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> duration of 1 to 6 years, presence of a fixed motor deficit that was stable for at least 2 months, and no contraindications to stereotactic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized at two centers to receive either 5 or 10 million implanted cells in 25 sites (seven patients per group) followed by participation in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation program, or to serve as a nonsurgical control group (rehabilitation only; four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical techniques used were the same at both centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent extensive pre- and postoperative motor testing and imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A for 1 week before and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy measure was a change in the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) motor score at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included Fugl-Meyer, Action Research Arm Test, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Impact Scale scores, as well as the results of other motor tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were ischemic in origin and nine were hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients who underwent surgery (ages 40-70 years) underwent uncomplicated surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serial evaluations (maximum duration 24 months) demonstrated no cell-related adverse serological or imaging-defined effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, another had a syncopal event, and in another there was burr-hole drainage of an asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of seven patients who received 5 million cells (mean improvement 6.9 points) and two of seven who received 10 million cells had improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> scores at 6 months; however, there was no significant change in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> motor score in patients who received cell implants (p = 0.756) compared with control or baseline values (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline, wrist movement and hand movement scores recorded on the Fugl-Meyer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Assessment instrument were not improved (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Action Research Arm Test gross hand-movement scores improved compared with control (p = 0.017) and baseline (p = 0.001) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>On the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Impact Scale, the 6-month daily activities score changed compared with baseline (p = 0.045) but not control (p = 0.056) scores, and the Everyday Memory test score improved in comparison with baseline (p = 0.004) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Human neuronal cells can be produced in culture and implanted stereotactically into the brains of patients with motor deficits due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although a measurable improvement was noted in some patients and this translated into improved activities of daily living in some patients as well, this study did not find evidence of a significant benefit in motor function as determined by the primary outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This experimental trial indicates the safety and feasibility of neuron transplantation for patients with motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
