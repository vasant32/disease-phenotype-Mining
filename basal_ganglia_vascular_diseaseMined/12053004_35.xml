<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have reported an association between cerebrovascular disease and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between vascular brain pathology seen on neuroimaging and changes in depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample included 3236 CHS participants who had an MRI brain scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic variables, medical history, functional status, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype were obtained at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual scores on a modified version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) scale were obtained initially and up to 7 years subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for important covariates, occurrence of depressive symptoms (defined as modified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D score of &gt;7) was associated with small lesions in the basal ganglia, large cortical white-matter lesions, and severe subcortical white-matter grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging variables did not predict incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> among those who were nondepressive at the time of MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistence of depressive symptoms across 2 consecutive time points was associated with small basal ganglia lesions and large cerebral cortical white-matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D score of &gt; or =5) was associated with subcortical white-matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease at baseline is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate the differential effects of subcortical white- versus gray-matter lesions on mood </plain></SENT>
