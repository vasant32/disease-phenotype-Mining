<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) is sometimes detected on routine brain ultrasonography in neonates, and is often associated with various perinatal and neonatal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most reports on LSV are retrospective with no controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the perinatal and neonatal clinical characteristics of neonates with LSV with matched controls and to summarise <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published reports of LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study that summarises the clinical, laboratory, and neurosonographic data of neonates with LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 1184 neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during a three year period, 857 had a routine head ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty one had LSV, and were compared with 42 matched controls with regard to gestational, perinatal, neonatal, laboratory, and neurosonographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LSV was detected in 21 of the 857 (2.45%) neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was bilateral in 10 of the 21 cases and located in the thalamus (n = 14) and basal ganglia (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infants with LSV were not significantly different from matched controls in most tested variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, compared with the control group, the LSV group included significantly more multiple births and more disturbances in amniotic fluid volume, but less meconial amniotic fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patients with LSV required fewer blood transfusions and less phototherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Except for more multiple births, neonates with LSV did not display more adverse findings than their matched controls </plain></SENT>
