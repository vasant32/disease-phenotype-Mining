<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about their prevalence and topographic distribution in the general elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: dVRS were evaluated by using high-resolution 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in 1826 subjects enrolled in the 3C-Dijon <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, dVRS were detected according to 3D imaging criteria and rated by using 4-level severity scores based in the BG or in the WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number and anatomic location of large dVRS (â‰¥3 mm) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: dVRS were observed in the BG or WM in every subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of dVRS was significantly associated with higher age in both the BG and WM, whereas sex was related to the severity of dVRS only in the BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large dVRS were detected in 33.2% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Status cribrosum was found in 1.3% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>dVRS were also highly prevalent within the hippocampus (44.5%) and hypothalamus (11.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: dVRS are always detected in the BG or WM in elderly people, and large dVRS are also prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The topographic distribution of dVRS is not uniform within the brain and may depend on anatomic or pathologic characteristics interacting with aging and sex </plain></SENT>
