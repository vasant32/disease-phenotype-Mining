<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the safety and feasibility of fetal porcine transplantation in 5 patients with basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and stable neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prevent rejection, cells were pretreated with an anti-MHC1 antibody and no immunosuppressive drugs were given to the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first 3 patients had no adverse cell, procedure, or imaging-defined effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient had temporary worsening of motor deficits 3 weeks after transplantation, and the fifth patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> 1 week after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI in both patients demonstrated areas of enhancement remote from the transplant site, which resolved on subsequent imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed improvement in speech, language, and/or motor impairments over several months and persisted at 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study was terminated by the FDA after the inclusion of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the transplantation of nontumor cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
