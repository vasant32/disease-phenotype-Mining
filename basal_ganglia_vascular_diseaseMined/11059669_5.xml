<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of previous investigations have focused on autopsied brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors attempted to verify the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> by using surgical specimens of the penetrating arteries responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 1999, the authors performed pathological studies in surgical specimens of lenticulostriate arteries that had been confirmed during microsurgery to be the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of the putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen lenticulostriate arteries were collected from 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these arteries were verified as the pathological causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They included six <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo>, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial ruptures</z:e> with substantial degenerative changes, and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial ruptures</z:e> with few degenerative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological findings in the lenticulostriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> were similar to those of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> in major cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> of lenticulostriate arteries have not been identified as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When penetrating arteries are included as causative vessels, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> may be much more common than previously thought </plain></SENT>
