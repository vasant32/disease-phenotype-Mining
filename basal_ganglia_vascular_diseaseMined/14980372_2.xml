<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bright linear 'branched candlestick' stripes in these regions, suggesting sonographic lenticulostriate vasculopathy, were reported in more than 200 infants in the English literature; including 34 our own patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify its long-term outcome, a prospective study was accomplished on our 34 infants with sonographic lenticulostriate vasculopathy which included 13 cryptogenic cases and 21 with distinct etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 7 to 9 years in the cryptogenic group, 7 in 13 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100033'>tics</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficits</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, and/or obsession/compulsion; while in the symptomatic group only 2 of 21 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100033'>tics</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of mortality (33% vs. 0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> (24% vs. 8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> (24% vs. 0%), and neurologic deficits (29% vs. 0%) were significantly higher in the symptomatic group than the cryptogenic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparatively, the occurrence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder</z:hpo> (10% vs. 54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100033'>tics</z:hpo> (10% vs. 38%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> (5% vs. 13%) were significantly lower in the symptomatic group than the cryptogenic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of these neuropsychiatric disorders were 10% in the symptomatic group and 54% in the cryptogenic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that idiopathic sonographic lenticulostriate vasculopathy in infancy may predict development of neuropsychiatric disorders later in childhood </plain></SENT>
