<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, patients with unilateral basal ganglia lesions due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were tested on a serial reaction time task in which responses were based on the spatial location of each stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spatial locations either followed a fixed sequence or were selected at random, with learning operationalized as the difference in reaction time between these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, three response-to-stimulus intervals were used, and these either followed a fixed sequence or were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to control participants, the patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> learning of the spatial and temporal sequences, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cross-dimensional learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was true for performance with either the contralesional or ipsilesional hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence learning was not correlated with maximum tapping rate, a simple measure of motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results raise questions concerning the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> as a model for studying basal ganglia dysfunction </plain></SENT>
