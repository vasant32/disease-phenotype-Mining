<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fitted the data about equally well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For mortalities related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates </plain></SENT>
