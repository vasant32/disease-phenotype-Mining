<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past 15 years the use of transcranial B-mode sonography to assess brainstem and subcortical brain structures has become an important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most widely recognised finding for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> has been an increase in echogenicity of the substantia nigra, an area of the midbrain that is affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding has enabled the reliable diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> with high predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other sonographic features, such as hypoechogenicity of the brainstem midline and hyperechogenicity of the lentiform nucleus, might help the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This Review provides detailed information about the advantages and limitations of this novel neuroimaging method, including guidelines for the scanning procedure and considerations on the origin of ultrasound abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the use of transcranial sonography for early and preclinical diagnosis and for differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo>, and we compare this method with other functional neuroimaging strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial B-mode sonography is a reliable, non-invasive, commonly available, easily applicable, and inexpensive method, which provides new information about the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the brain to help the diagnosis of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this neuroimaging method could be recommended for general application in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
