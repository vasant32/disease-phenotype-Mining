<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 17 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> who were managed at a single institution from 2004 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 12 years (range 10 months-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were saccular and 24% were fusiform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was one infectious and one distal lenticulostriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were predominantly male and presented more commonly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were dissecting in nature or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> with intramural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment was dependent upon the type and location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pedriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial diseases</z:e> with different etiologies, diverse <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and dissimilar clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
