<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many instances, the performance of these patients is compared to that of patients with focal lesions of other brain structures such as the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we studied the performance of patients with focal basal ganglia lesions on three fundamental motor tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had suffered unilateral damage in the striatum and were tested in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first task required the participants to tap with their index finger as fast as possible; this test provided a simple assessment of motor competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, the maximum tapping rate was lower for the patients when tapping with their contralesional limb, although the deficit was not severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second and third tasks were designed to assess timing and force control, two functions that have been associated with basal ganglia function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients performed similar to controls on both tasks and showed no evidence of impairment when using their contralesional limb compared to their ipsilesional limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that unilateral basal ganglia lesions tend to produce minor motor problems in force control, and fail to support the hypothesized role of the basal ganglia in timing </plain></SENT>
