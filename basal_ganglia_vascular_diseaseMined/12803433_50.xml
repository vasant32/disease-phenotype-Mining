<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with frontal lesions (FG), 20 patients with lesions outside the frontal cortex (NFG), 8 patients with lesions to the basal ganglia (BG), and 20 orthopedic controls (OG) performed the stop-signal task that allows the estimation of the time it takes to inhibit an ongoing reaction (stop signal reaction time [SSRT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FG and the BG showed significantly longer SSRTs than the OG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the FG, patients with right and bilateral lesions showed significantly longer SSRTs than patients with left lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results provide evidence for a role of the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia in the inhibition of ongoing responses </plain></SENT>
