<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Giant dilations occur only rarely and can be easily misdiagnosed as central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relevant surgical literature was reviewed to help establish indications for surgical intervention in these typically benign lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Giant dilations of the PVSs in 12 patients who had undergone surgery for several different indications were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both clinical and radiographic presentations of these patients were reviewed along with the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dilations of the PVSs can become giant lesions that may necessitate surgical intervention to relieve mass effect or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship of these lesions to neurological symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
