<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Women in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labor</z:e> were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>), other tocolytic, or saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surviving babies underwent head ultrasounds (HUS) (weeks of life 1, 2, and 4) and periodic developmental examinations (months 4, 8, 12, and 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 140 infants, 17.1% (24) had neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH), and 10.0% (14) had LSV (half of the latter (7 of 14) had both IVH and LSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a regression model in which other risk factors were controlled for, the association between antenatal exposures to tocolytic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> &gt;or=50 g and LSV were significant (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5 to 45.0; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our data and their analyses, we infer that antenatal exposure to high-dosage, tocolytic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> may be associated with LSV </plain></SENT>
