<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a rare ruptured fusiform lenticulostriatal perforating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from a proximal M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch, discerned on superselective microcatheter angiography, presenting solely with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 50-year-old previously healthy man presented with diffuse SAH and negative CT angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram demonstrated a 2 mm fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presumably arising from the right lateral lenticulostriate perforator but the exact origin of the perforator was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superselective angiography was required to precisely delineate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and its vessel of origin and directly influenced treatment planning (surgical trapping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superselective microcatheter angiography provides both an option for endovascular therapy as well as more accurate delineation for surgical planning for these rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
