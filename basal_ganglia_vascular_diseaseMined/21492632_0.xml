<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We recently demonstrated that the preprocedural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern of deep middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory injury predicts poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the structures of the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> field are particularly vulnerable to hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions involving the M1 segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with diffusion restriction of at least 50% of the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> field on MRI (M1a pattern) that underwent endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared those with and without recanalization in regards to HT and disability on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recanalized M1a group (n=27) had higher rates of HT (67% vs. 25%, P=0.05) and a trend toward more parenchymal HT (37% vs. 0%, P=0.07) and symptomatic HT (22% vs. 0%, P=0.12) than those M1a patients who failed to recanalize (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale by discharge was better in the survivors of the recanalized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with the preintervention M1a MRI pattern of advanced basal ganglionic injury, successful recanalization predicts a higher risk of HT but better outcome </plain></SENT>
