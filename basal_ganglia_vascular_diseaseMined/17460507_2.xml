<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Lenticulostriate artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When present, distal locations in and around the basal ganglia are more common and often present with intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> when ruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a very rare case of a ruptured proximal lenticulostriate fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 31-year-old healthy man who presented after the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> without neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomographic scanning demonstrated diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and a cranial computed tomographic angiogram demonstrated a vascular irregularity on the superior surface of the left distal M1 trunk of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cerebral angiogram demonstrated a left proximal lenticulostriate fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-like vessels or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other pathology or infectious etiology was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Endovascular therapy was deemed unsafe, and microsurgical exploration and intervention was the more favorable and safe approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A standard left pterional craniotomy was performed and the afferent lenticulostriate vessel into the fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temporary clips were applied to the proximal and distal M1 trunk and miniclips were applied across the afferent portion and fundus of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, thus sacrificing the parent lenticulostriate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A postoperative computed tomographic scan demonstrated an area of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient's postoperative right facial and upper extremity <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> improved to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> several days after aneurysmal clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a ruptured proximal lenticulostriate artery fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which presented as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in a healthy patient without an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
