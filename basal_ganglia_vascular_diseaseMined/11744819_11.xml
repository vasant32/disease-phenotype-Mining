<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past century vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP) has been established, dismissed and recently re-established as a possible clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review the clinical features that have been proposed to suggest the diagnosis and explore how precisely VP has been defined on the basis of clinical, as well as radiological and pathological grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the frequency of this condition have been based on population-based incidence and prevalence studies and also using case series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these published studies and present their estimates of frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the wide variations in these estimates may be largely explicable by variation in case definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When studies are limited to those with either imaging or pathological support for the diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one estimate that 3-6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> have a vascular cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> have been seen in up to 38% of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this appreciably high frequency, and with consideration of the implications for clinician and scientist, we suggest that VP needs to be recognised as an important clinical diagnosis, and includes a spectrum of distinct pathophysiological entities </plain></SENT>
