<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> for cerebral microbleeds and to investigate the relationship between microbleeds on the one hand, and the volume of age-related white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on the other in an elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and thirty-nine elderly subjects (age range: 72-85; mean: 77) suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or at high risk for developing this condition were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each subject the number and localization of the microbleeds was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of microbleeds in this study was 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found age and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to be risk factors for microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After regional subdivision systolic blood pressure was found to be a risk factor for microbleeds located in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was more prevalent in patients with corticosubcortical and basal ganglia microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging risk factors associated with one or more microbleeds were total WMH volume, subcortical WMH volume, and periventricular WMH volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total WMH volume and periventricular WMH volume were risk factors for corticosubcortical microbleeds and basal ganglia microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of microbleeds was found in a population of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or at high risk for developing this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and WMH were the most important risk factors for microbleeds, especially when located in the corticosubcortial junction or in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
