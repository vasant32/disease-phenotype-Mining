<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed examination of KVH's level of language processing breakdown revealed mild difficulties with phonological encoding and severe difficulties accessing the lexical form of the word </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of KVH's neologisms contained phonemes perseverated from previous neologisms, suggesting an integral relationship between the production of neologisms and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseveration</z:e> of phonemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, KVH's patterns of whole word (total)and phonological (blended) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseverations</z:e> reflected his proposed underlying language processing deficits, consistent with recent literature on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">perseveration</z:e> (e.g.,Cohen and Dehaene, 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the simple binary distinction oftotalandblendedperseveration is proposed to be somewhat limited for understanding the underlying nature of KVH's complex neologistic errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations regarding the mechanisms underlying the production of KVH's neologistic and perseverative errors also are discussed </plain></SENT>
