<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to cocaine has been associated with a wide spectrum of structural abnormalities in infant brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growing use of crack, a smokable and extremely addictive form of cocaine, could exacerbate the situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, type and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> detected by transfontanellar US in newborns exposed to crack during gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study, involving a review of the medical records of children who were born to crack-using women and who were subjected to transfontanellar US imaging during their first days of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfontanellar US revealed abnormalities in 45/129 newborns examined (34.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes detected were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002416'>subependymal cysts</z:hpo> in 24 infants (18.6%), lenticulostriate vasculopathy in 18 infants (14%), subependymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 9 infants (7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002190'>choroid plexus cysts</z:hpo> in 9 infants (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the abnormalities found by US examination were discrete and likely without clinical significance for the babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, prospective studies with a long period of tracking are needed to determine whether there are later consequences on the neurodevelopment of children with prenatal exposure to crack </plain></SENT>
