<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the risk factors of dilated Virchow-Robin spaces (dVRS) and their relation with other markers of brain small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated both issues in a large population-based sample of elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Severity of dVRS was semiquantitatively graded in both white matter and basal ganglia using high-resolution 3-dimensional MRI images taken from 1818 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free subjects enrolled in the Three-City Dijon MRI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression models were used to model the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, APOE genotype, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and MRI markers of small vessel disease with the degree of dVRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severity of dVRS was found to be strongly associated with age in both basal ganglia (degree 4 versus 1: OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2) and white matter (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of hypertensive subjects increased with the degrees of dVRS in both basal ganglia (P = 0.02) and white matter (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men presented a higher risk of severe dVRS in basal ganglia than women, particularly degree 4 (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.8 to 19.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of dVRS was associated with the volume of white matter hyperintensities and the prevalence of lacunes, but not with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study of elderly subjects, the degree of dVRS appears independently associated with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, volume of white matter hyperintensities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>dVRS should be considered as another MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease in the elderly with regional variations in their severity </plain></SENT>
