<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In previous studies, lenticulostriated vasculopathy (LSV) was detected in 0.4-5.8% of neonates who had undergone brain ultrasound studies during the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most infants were referred from neonatal intensive care units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various clinical conditions were associated with LSV including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intrauterine infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether LSV as a single abnormal finding in neonates with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is a sign of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ultrasonographic and clinical data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>, followed in our hospital, were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> infants with symptomatic congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> for 6 weeks, followed by valganciclovir until the age of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infants with asymptomatic as well as symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were followed up with brainstem evoked response and behavioural studies every 4 months until 4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 92 infants diagnosed with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 50 (54.3%) infants, LSV was detected on initial brain ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 21 (42%) infants had other ultrasonographic findings consistent with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>; 11 (22%) had other symptoms of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement and in 18 (36%) cases the only abnormal finding was LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 18 infants with LSV as the only finding on initial examination, antiviral therapy was not started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hearing deterioration developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine infants between ages 4 and 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to these cases, the authors modified their therapy protocol and began treating congenital CMV infants with only LSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9 infants were treated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> maintained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing after 8-27 months of follow-up (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LSV is a common finding in infants with symptomatic congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> and is a sign of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LSV is a possible marker of high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in infants with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
