<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors used a 3% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> solution for final hemostasis after removal of a left insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately afterward, air bubbles were observed within the lumen of the polar temporal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed punctate areas of infarction in the lenticulostriate artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors designed an experimental study to elucidate the mechanism of remote O2 emboli and reactive O2 species-related vasoactive responses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> irrigation was used in mice with either an intact pial layer or after the pia mater was removed through a corticotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> saline irrigation was used in the corresponding control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vessels were examined for intravascular O2 emboli under the microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were then obtained and stained with H &amp; E and the 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) antibody to evaluate intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple bubbles were observed within the lumen of the vessels after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> regardless of whether the pial layer was destroyed or intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining for 3-NT showed an abundant positive reaction in the vessel walls of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Samples taken from the animals that received saline showed no positive staining for 3-NT and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> may cause serious ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> may cause vasoactive responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> and platelet aggregation/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and the free diffusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> through the vessel walls and its conversion to water and O2 leads to O2 bubbles within the closed vessel lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If used intradurally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> may have deleterious ischemic effects, and it can only be used carefully in open extradural spaces </plain></SENT>
