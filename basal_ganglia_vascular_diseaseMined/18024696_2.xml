<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 16 cases have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early detection and treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is also difficult because of their deep location, small size and angioarchitecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, arising from the distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>, who presented with deep intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conclusions drawn from our experience and a comprehensive review of the literature include the following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) A distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be considered in young (mean 38.5 years) and non-hypertensive (80%) patients with deep intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are frequently very small (&lt;5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they cannot be detected on initial angiograms in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have higher rates of associated vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deep intracerebral haemorrhage, even in those over the age of 50 years, can still be due to underlying, treatable structural abnormalities, and should not be dismissed as being a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, a more comprehensive diagnostic approach seems to be warranted in younger patients and those without known <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
