<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been no study assessing cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans in newborn infants born in equatorial Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the cUS scans of apparently well newborn term Ugandan infants and to correlate the findings with perinatal data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An observational study of apparently healthy postnatal ward term Ugandan infants at Mulago Hospital, Makerere University Hospital, Kampala, Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 112 infants scanned at a median age of 1.4 postnatal days were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 57 (51%) infants had scans considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, including 30 infants with isolated focal peritrigonal white matter (WM) echogenicity that was very common, occurring in 60 (53%) of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More extensive WM echogencities were seen in nine (7.5%) and focal unilateral central grey matter echogenicity in eight (6.5%) infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhage was not common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subependymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocysts</z:mpath> (SEP) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002190'>choroid plexus cysts</z:hpo> (CPC) occurred in 19.6% of infants each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four infants only had lenticulostriate vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between mode of delivery, birth weight, head circumference or gestational age, maternal HIV status and any cUS abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Apparently well term-born Ugandan infants frequently have abnormalities on cUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These are mainly increased WM echogenicity, SEP and CPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These may relate to the reported high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infections</z:e> in this population but this remains to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The observations provide baseline data for comparison with scans from sick infants from similar communities and are also important for studies in which cUS will be used to assess progress </plain></SENT>
