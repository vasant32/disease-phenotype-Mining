<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Previous cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism studies suggest that the basal ganglia or thalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal kinesigenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001266'>choreoathetosis</z:hpo> (PKC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying cerebral abnormalities in idiopathic PKC have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To localise cerebral perfusion abnormalities in PKC, we performed interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) in PKC patients and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients with idiopathic PKC and 18 age- and sex-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were de novo diagnosed as having PKC, or had not taken medication for at least 3 months; none of them had structural abnormalities on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had a history of PKC attacks of a duration not exceeding 5 min and starting either on one side or on both sides of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These attacks were always induced by a sudden initiation of voluntary movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PKC attacks were recorded in a hospital after being induced by neurology staff in 13 of the 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> SPECT was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients and 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between the cerebral perfusion in the PKC group and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group were tested by statistical parametric mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Student's t test was used for inter-group comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, patients with idiopathic PKC showed interictal hypoperfusion in the posterior regions of the bilateral caudate nuclei (false discovery rate-corrected P&lt;0.001 with a small volume correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that cerebral perfusion abnormality of bilateral caudate nuclei is present in idiopathic PKC </plain></SENT>
