<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Auditory neglect, defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> to stimuli within the left hemispace, is mostly reported in association with left ear extinction in dichotic listening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains disputed as to how far dichotic extinction reflects a primary attentional deficit and is thus appropriate for the diagnosis of auditory neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here on four patients who presented left ear extinction in dichotic listening following right unilateral hemispheric lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Auditory spatial attention was assessed with two additional tasks: (i) diotic test by means of interaural time differences (ITDs), simulating bilateral simultaneous spatial presentation of the dichotic tasks without the inconvenience of interaural intensity or content difference; and (ii) sound localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hemispatial asymmetry on the ITD diotic test or a spatial bias on sound localization were found to be part of auditory neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients (J.C.N. and M.B.) presented a marked hemispatial asymmetry favouring the ipsilesional hemispace in the ITD diotic test, but did not show any spatial bias in sound localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other patients (A.J. and E.S.) had the reverse profile: no hemispatial asymmetry in the ITD diotic test, but a severe spatial bias directed to the ipsilesional side in sound localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>J.C.N. and M.B. had mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> affecting the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A.J. and E.S. had cortical lesions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, there are two behaviourally and anatomically distinct types of auditory neglect characterized by: (i) deficit in allocation of auditory spatial attention following lesions centred on basal ganglia; or (ii) distortion of auditory spatial representation following frontotemporoparietal lesions </plain></SENT>
