<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although postmortem studies have demonstrated mural thickening in leptomeningeal arteries and lenticulostriate perforating arteries, it is unclear whether this also leads to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-field MRI scanners enable in vivo imaging of the lumen of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters of lenticulostriate arteries in living patients with CADASIL and to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing is correlated with the number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two NOTCH3 mutation carriers and 11 healthy control subjects were examined using high-resolution 3-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography imaging on a 7-T MRI scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scans were analyzed for the presence of focal stenotic segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number, length, and total cross-sectional area of lenticulostriate arteries were measured and compared between mutation carriers and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These measurements were correlated with age, disease duration, and number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No stenotic segments were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences between mutation carriers and control subjects were found in total number of end branches (mutation carriers: mean, 14.6; control subjects: mean, 12.8), length of the lenticulostriate system, or total cross-sectional area of lenticulostriate artery lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurements of lenticulostriate artery lumina were not associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> load in the basal ganglia area or with basal ganglia hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic on 7 T showed no differences in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters of lenticulostriate arteries between patients with CADASIL and control subjects </plain></SENT>
