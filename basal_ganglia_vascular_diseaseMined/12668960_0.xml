<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Xe CT used 30% static <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>, 4 min wash-in, and 5 min wash-out, while perfusion CT was done by injecting 30 ml of non-ionic contrast medium at a rate of 9 ml/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients underwent these examinations (30 serious cases and 18 mild) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficients in the hemispheric area were r=0.713 (p&lt;0.01) with Xe-CBF and perfusion CBF in mild cases and r=0.567 (p&lt;0.01) in serious cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two CBF values were especially disparate in serious cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value for perfusion CBF was almost double that of Xe-CBF in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion CT was a useful examination for the detection of CBF, but in serious cases, CBF needs to be determined by Xe-CT as well </plain></SENT>
