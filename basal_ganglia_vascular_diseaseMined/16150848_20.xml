<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous observations suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> due to subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be explained by dysfunction of cortical areas rather than through the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the subcortical structures itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to identify the dysfunctional cortical regions induced by basal ganglia <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a patient group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions centring on the basal ganglia, we examined the common area(s) of structurally intact but dysfunctional cortical tissue by using spatial normalization of PWI maps as well as symmetric voxel-wise inter-hemispheric comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These new techniques allow comparison of the structurally intact but abnormally perfused areas of different individuals in the same stereotaxic space, and at the same time avoid problems due to regional perfusion differences and to possible observer-dependent biases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> centring on the right basal ganglia which provoke <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> induce abnormal perfusion in a circumscribed area of intact cortex that typically involves those three regions that have previously been described to provoke <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> when damaged directly by cortical infarction: the superior temporal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule and the inferior frontal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> following a right basal ganglia lesion typically is caused by the dysfunction of (part of) these specific cortical areas </plain></SENT>
