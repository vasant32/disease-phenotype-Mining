<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the capability of flow-sensitive black blood (FSBB) acquisition to visualize the lenticulostriate artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>) in comparison with time-of-flight (TOF) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one healthy subjects (13 males and 8 females, 19-44 years old) were enrolled in this study after obtaining written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed with FSBB and TOF to visualize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> using a 1.5T MRI unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In FSBB acquisition a motion probing gradient of b = 4 sec/mm(2) was applied to dephase blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were reconstructed into coronal sections and were evaluated in terms of number, length, and image quality at origins and distal areas of visualized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> branches with a four-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 145 LSA branches were visualized with FSBB and 66 branches with TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> visualized only with TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluated terms, FSBB was significantly better than TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We could better visualize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> with FSBB than with TOF, both quantitatively and qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FSBB is a promising method, although it remains to be evaluated in clinical cases </plain></SENT>
