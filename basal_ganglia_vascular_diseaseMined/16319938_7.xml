<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> and Neurologic Endpoints Trial and the work of many others, a unifying triangular concept is proposed to account for the increased prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, with their likely resultant mortality, in neonates and infants exposed to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review the evidence that: (1) elevated circulating levels of serum ionized <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> occurring in mothers, and therefore in their babies, at the time of delivery are associated with subsequent neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH); (2) neonatal IVH is strongly associated with lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV), an unusual mineralizing lesion involving the thalami and basal ganglia of the neonate; and, (3) exposure to 50 g or more of tocolytic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labor</z:e> is associated with the development of LSV </plain></SENT>
