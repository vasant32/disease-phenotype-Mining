<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective case-control design, we reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> premature infants who were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit between 1996 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of LSV was 4.6% (21 of 453) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with late LSV (detected after 10 days of age) had less exposure than controls to prenatal steroids [42.8% (6 of 14) vs. 92.8% (13 of 14), respectively; p&lt;0.01], and prenatal antibiotics [42.8% (6 of 14) vs. 85.7% (12 of 14), respectively; p=0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven percent (8 of 14) of patients with late LSV had a low Apgar score vs. 14.2% (2 of 14) of the control group (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with LSV also had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851647" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle tone abnormalities</z:e> than controls at 6 months of age [33.3% (5 of 15) vs. 5.2% (1 of 19), respectively; p=0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with late LSV have less exposure to antenatal steroids and antibiotics, lower Apgar scores, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003808'>abnormal muscle tone</z:hpo> at 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
