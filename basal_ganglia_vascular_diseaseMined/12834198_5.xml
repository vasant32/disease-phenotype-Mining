<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data from a cross-sectional community survey of Korean elders, we sought to investigate this within a sample with relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample consisted of 341 participants with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Korean version) scores of 24/30 or below </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous diagnoses were ascertained and participants were examined for resting blood pressure and nonfasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, occupation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278080" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">physical dependence</z:e>, and cholesterol levels, worse cognitive function (MMSE score &lt;21) within the sample was associated with raised systolic blood pressure, raised <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, and a previous diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were significant only in participants with no formal education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group the adjusted odds ratios for worse cognitive function were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.34) for each 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and 3.47 (1.14-10.6) for a previous diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for the group with previous education were 0.99 (0.81-1.21) and 1.82 (0.48-6.92), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The association between risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> appears to be particularly strong in people with lower educational attainment </plain></SENT>
