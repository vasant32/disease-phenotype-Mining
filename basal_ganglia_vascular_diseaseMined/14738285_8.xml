<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of basal ganglia dysfunction on semantic processing was investigated by comparing the performance of individuals with nonthalamic subcortical (NS) vascular lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), cortical lesions, and matched controls on a semantic priming task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unequibiased lexical ambiguity primes were used in auditory prime-target pairs comprising 4 critical conditions; dominant related (e.g., bank-money), subordinate related (e.g., bank-river), dominant unrelated (e.g., foot-money) and subordinate unrelated (e.g., bat-river) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants made speeded lexical decisions (word/nonword) on targets using a go-no-go response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When a short prime-target interstimulus interval (ISI) of 200 ms was employed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups demonstrated priming for dominant and subordinate conditions, indicating nonselective meaning facilitation and intact automatic lexical processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences emerged at the long ISI (1250 ms), where control and cortical lesion participants evidenced selective facilitation of the dominant meaning, whereas NS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> groups demonstrated a protracted period of nonselective meaning facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests a circumscribed deficit in the selective attentional engagement of the semantic network on the basis of meaning frequency, possibly implicating a disturbance of frontal-subcortical systems influencing inhibitory semantic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
