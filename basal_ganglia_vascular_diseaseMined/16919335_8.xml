<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment resistance may be associated with vascular-based lesions in the white matter and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS) are cerebrospinal fluid spaces associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> of small cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study tested the hypothesis that dilation of Virchow-Robin spaces seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is associated with treatment resistance in elderly depressed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (age over 60 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> (29 responders to monotherapy, 21 non-responders to monotherapy) and 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment of deep white matter lesions [WML] and periventricular hyperintensities [PVH] (both with the Scheltens rating scale score, [Scheltens, P., Barkhof, F., Leys, D., et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>J Neurol Sci;114(1):7-12.]) and the severity of VRS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (using a new scale) were scored from MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical group comparisons and multiple regression analyses were performed to quantify the relationship between imaging features and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a trend for greater WML Scheltens scores in the monotherapy resistant group compared to responders and control subjects, but only using the basal ganglia VRS score was there a statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A score of 2 or greater on the VRS score was 80% sensitive and 62% specific in predicting non-response to antidepressant monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The VRS score accounted for 38% of the variance in the multiple regression model and the PVH score, which was an independent predictor of outcome, contributed another 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Numbers are small and type II errors possible, especially for the Scheltens ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment response was limited to response or non-response to monotherapy and was retrospectively derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The VRS scale was originally designed for use in patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and has not been used before in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">affective disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> depressed subjects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo>, it is possible that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> led to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> rather than vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VRS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is common in diseases associated with microvascular abnormality, which is the presumed basis of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>VRS score may be useful in determining which patients are less likely to respond to antidepressant monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of patients with a wider range of treatment responses are indicated </plain></SENT>
