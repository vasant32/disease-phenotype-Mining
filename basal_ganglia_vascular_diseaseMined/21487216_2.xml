<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation is frequently observed within the first 7 days and is characterized by molecular and cellular changes in the neurovascular unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of water channels, aquaporins (AQPs), within the neurovascular unit has led to intensive research in understanding the underlying roles of each of the AQPs under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions and in different diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we summarize some of the recent knowledge on AQPs, focusing on AQP4, the most abundant AQP in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several experimental models illustrate that AQPs have dual, complex regulatory roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation and resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, no specific therapeutic agents have been developed to inhibit water flux through these channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, experimental results strongly suggest that this is an important area for future investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, early inhibition of water channels may have positive effects in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At later time points during the course of disease, AQP is important for the clearance of water from the brain into blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, AQPs, and in particular AQP4, have important roles in the resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The function of these water channel proteins makes them an excellent therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
