<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with extensive WMLs, as determined by MRI, were divided into two groups - 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> and 7 without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuronal integrity was evaluated with a PET scan using [(11)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ) by calculating the distribution volume of FMZ (FMZ-V(d)) in various regions of interest by non-linear curve fitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, tracer kinetic analysis was applied for voxel-by-voxel quantification of FMZ-V(d) and data analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striatal FMZ-V(d) values were inversely correlated with the motor UPDRS scores (r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.005), and their reductions were associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, differences in neuronal integrity in the striatum may determine whether patients with WMLs develop VaP or not </plain></SENT>
