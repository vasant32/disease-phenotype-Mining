<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> involving the distal lenticulostriate artery branches are a rare cause of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of ruptured lenticulostriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in an otherwise healthy patient and review the literature on this topic.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Computed tomography showed a right basal ganglia <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in a 44-year-old Native American woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed a 2-mm <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a distal lenticulostriate artery branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: A pterional craniotomy was performed on a delayed basis using computed tomographic angiography and frameless stereotactic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal ganglia <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was evacuated, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was identified and clipped using microsurgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the base of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involved a portion of the parent vessel wall, it was wrapped with cotton and reinforced with cyanoacrylate glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient did well after surgery and was discharged to home with outpatient rehabilitation on the third postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> are fairly common, the underlying vascular abnormality is rarely identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most are related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive vascular degeneration</z:e>, rupture of a Charcot-Bouchard <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurs in young patients, however, aggressive investigation is warranted to rule out a structural vascular abnormality </plain></SENT>
