<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is an unconfounded association between neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) and lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV (also known as thalamostriate or mineralizing vasculopathy)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: During the conduct of the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> and Neurologic Endpoints Trial (MagNET), a randomized controlled trial involving maternal, hence fetal, exposure to antenatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labor</z:e>, head ultrasounds were obtained for each of the surviving neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of our previous experience in the diagnosis of LSV, when ascertaining the presence of IVH, as called for by the research protocol of our study, the presence or absence of LSV was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found LSV to be relatively prevalent (10% (14 of 140) among surviving babies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, it was significantly associated with the occurrence of neonatal IVH, even when controlled for possible confounding (adjusted OR 9.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 73.1; p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the known relationships between IVH and neonatal morbidity and mortality, the finding of a statistically significant association between neonatal IVH and LSV may suggest more substantial implications for the latter than previously believed </plain></SENT>
