<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cerebral abnormalities detected by cranial ultrasound (cUS) have been reported in infants born to mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenesis of the infants' brain injury remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors aimed to study the possible association between abnormalities on neonatal cUS and perinatal factors related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011437'>maternal autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: cUS evaluation was carried out at birth in 114 infants born to mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, and repeated up to 8-9 months of life in those showing sonographic abnormalities at the first examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors analysed the relationships among cerebral ultrasound abnormalities and antenatal exposure to maternal drug treatment, placental transfer of auto-antibodies and gestational complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, infants were investigated for neuromotor development from birth to 24 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral ultrasound abnormalities, including subependymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocyst</z:mpath>, lenticulostriate vasculopathy and echogenic periventricular white matter, were detected in 41 of 114 infants (35.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between abnormalities on cUS and the perinatal factors included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cases of persistent cerebral ultrasound abnormalities or neuromotor delay were observed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of cerebral ultrasound abnormalities were observed in a cohort of infants born to mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no perinatal factors were significantly associated with this finding, suggesting the fetal brain impairment had a multi-factorial aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no case of neuromotor delay was observed, long term neurological assessment of these babies is recommended in view of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
