<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions of the putamen and either <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder or traits of the disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-five children with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions were studied with standardized psychiatric assessments and anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of lesion overlap in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen of 25 subjects had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The densest area of overlapping lesions (n = 7) in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits included the posterior ventral putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median lesion volume was 9.7 cm3, and the distribution was highly skewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore the following analyses focused on the 13 subjects with lesions &lt; 10 cm3: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits were exhibited in 6/7 subjects with putamen lesionsversus 2/6 with no putamen lesions (Fisherexacttestp= .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Half (4/8) of the subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits had overlapping lesions encompassing the posterior ventral putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 5 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits had lesions in this empirically derived region of interest (Fisher exact test p = .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lesions within the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-rich ventral putamen, which is part of the ventral or limbic striatum, tended to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>/Traits may therefore be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> syndrome associated with dysfunction in this cortical-striato-thalamocortical loop </plain></SENT>
