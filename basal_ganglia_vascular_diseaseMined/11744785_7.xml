<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst most cognitive functions were intact, she showed specific neuropsychological deficits, most notably a difficulty in developing, through abstraction of the relevant information, a higher-level rule by which to guide behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The types of rule affected were those based upon an attentional set (attending to a particular dimension of stimulus features, such as 'shape') or a response strategy (continuing to apply a previously successful pattern of responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The learning of lower-level rules based on stimulus-reward values was spared, as was the ability to apply an instructed rule and to discontinue use of rules which were no longer appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence for the dissociability of cognitive functions within the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
