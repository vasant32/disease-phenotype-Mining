<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A correlation between cytomegalovirus (CMV) load in urine and severity of disease in congenitally infected infants has previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMV load in postnatally infected infants has not been studied before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate CMV load in urine of infants with postnatal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infection</z:e> and correlate this with clinical symptoms of CMV disease and cerebral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Infants admitted to our NICU between July 2000 and February 2010, and diagnosed with congenital or postnatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>, cranial ultrasonography (cUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMV urine loads of postnatally infected infants were analyzed and compared with CMV urine loads of congenitally infected infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen infants with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> and 45 infants with postnatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen/17 (76%) congenitally infected infants had clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> at birth and 11/17 (65%) had cerebral abnormalities diagnosed by neuro-imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the four asymptomatic infants had cerebral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the postnatally infected infants 43/45 (96%) did not develop any clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>, but in 23/45 (51%) cerebral abnormalities such as lenticulostriate vasculopathy and germinolytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median CMV load in postnatally infected infants was significantly lower than in congenitally infected infants (1.0×10(5)copies/ml versus 8.5×10(6)copies/ml, p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CMV load in urine is significantly lower in infants with postnatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> than in infants with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> irrespective of clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> or cerebral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
