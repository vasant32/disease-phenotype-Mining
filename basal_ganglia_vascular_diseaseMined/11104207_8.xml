<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess cortico-cortical inhibition (CCI) and facilitation (CCF) in the opponens pollicis muscle of patients with atypical, non-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi>- (LD) responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, CCI (interstimulus interval [ISI], 3 ms) was significantly reduced in 10 patients with predominantly parkinsonian multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (MSA-P) and in seven with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP), but not in four with predominantly cerebellar MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant change of CCF (ISI, 12 ms) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the amount of CCI and clinical status as evaluated with the Unified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale (UPDRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (5 MSA-P, 5 VP), CCI was significantly increased by LD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration without concurrent clinical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of CCI are not peculiar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> and seem unlikely to underlie any specific parkinsonian feature, but rather possibly reflect a nonspecific imbalance of inhibitory and facilitatory motor cortical circuits </plain></SENT>
