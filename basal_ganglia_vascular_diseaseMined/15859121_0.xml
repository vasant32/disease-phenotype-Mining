<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to clarify risk factors for requiring long-term care and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality among middle-aged and elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 2292 residents (759 males and 1,533 females) living in rural areas and attending health checkups during 1989-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the data obtained, we examined risk factors for long-term care needs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observation period was from health checkups to March 2002 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and to September 2002 for long-term care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox' proportional hazards model was used to assess for both outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was two and a half times as high among males as among females, there were no differences between the sexes in the rate for requiring long-term care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In thirty five percent of cases needing long-term care, this was attributable to cerebrovascular diseases, in 24% to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and in 9% to fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors significantly associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were age, low BMI, low total cholesterol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, and smoking among males and females, as well as urine sugar among males and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> among females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors significantly associated with requiring long-term care were age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and urine sugar among males, and age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and urine sugar among females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is important for avoiding necessity for long-term care </plain></SENT>
