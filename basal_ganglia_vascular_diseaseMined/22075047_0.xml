<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the impact of the mere implantation of stimulation electrodes on the performance of fast movements in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 9 PD patients with subthalamic electrodes and 9 patients with segmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> with electrodes in the globus pallidus internum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied on the first postoperative day without electrical stimulation of the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects had to perform boxing movements with either touching the target or stopping the fist in front of the target </plain></SENT>
