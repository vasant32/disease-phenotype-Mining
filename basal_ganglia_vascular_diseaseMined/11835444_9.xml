<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP) is a poorly defined entity which has clinical, and perhaps pathological, overlap with other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although classical VP involves lesions of the basal ganglia, the majority of cases actually show diffuse subcortical white matter changes (SCWMC) on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exact pathologies of these white matter changes are debated and likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, but are generally thought to represent areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or recurrent partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is the treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and has been reported to improve symptoms in some patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and associated SCWMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether historical, clinical, or radiographic factors predict improvement in VP patients after CSF drainage, we removed 35-40 ml of CSF via lumbar punctures (LP) from 40 patients and compared responders with nonresponders for a variety of demographics, clinical features, and blindly interpreted magnetic resonance images (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (37.5%) reported "significant and irrefutable" gait improvement after LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve (30.0%) reported no effect and 13 (32.5%) reported mild or very transient improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Timed gait in a subset of patients improved (P &lt; 0.05) immediately after LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically, improvement after CSF removal was predicted by any positive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001), the lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertical gaze palsies</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), the lack of a pure freezing gait (P &lt; 0.05), and the lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blinded MRI interpretation did not find features which clearly predicted response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some patients diagnosed with VP improved after LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinically, these patients tended to resemble idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, whereas nonresponders more closely resembled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e> (PSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigation and also raise the possibility of testing CSF drainage in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> complicated by SCWMC </plain></SENT>
