We report a case of perioperative management of a neonate with popliteal pterygium syndrome complicated by interalveolar syngnathia. Syngnathia were excised in the operating room without a major anaesthetic. We discuss our management of this case, as well as other possible strategies to secure the airway in neonates with syngnathia. We also reviewed the literature regarding airway management in presence of syngnathia in similar situations.
