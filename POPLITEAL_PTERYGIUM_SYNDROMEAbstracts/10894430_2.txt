The present study describes a Swedish family in which the mother and her son were affected with signs of popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS, OMIM 119500). Both individuals had bilateral complete cleft lip and palate, oral synechiae, paramedian pits on the lower lip, toe syndactyly and a piece of triangular skin overgrowth on the great toes. The son also presented with soft tissue syndactyly of the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Although popliteal pterygium was not found, the above clinical features were diagnostic for PPS. Chromosomal abnormalities were not revealed in either case by cytogenetic analyses. A test for microdeletion in the VWS region at 1q32-q41 was performed in the family using 5 polymorphic microsatellite markers from the region. The affected son was found to be heterozygous for all 5 markers, suggesting that microdeletion at the VWS region was unlikely. The VWS locus, however, was not excluded by haplotype analysis of the family.
