A 2-year-old boy presented at our hospital with severe familial popliteal pterygium syndrome with extensive skin webbing from thigh to heel and severely reduced range of motion of the knee and ankle joints. For accomplishment of knee extension, the patient underwent surgery with resection of the fibrous bands, freeing of the sciatic nerve, Z-lengthening of the Achilles tendon and multiple Z-plasties. One year after surgery, the patient can put his heel on the ground and has almost complete range of motion in the knee and ankle joints.
