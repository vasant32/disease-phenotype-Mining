The craniofacial abnormalities of popliteal pterygium syndrome present unique challenges to the pediatric anesthetist. Congenital fibrous bands between the maxilla and mandible limit mouth opening and the tongue may be fused to the palate. We describe the use of the Shikani Optical Stylet, a novel fiberoptic endoscope, in the airway management of a neonate with popliteal pterygium syndrome and syngnathia.
