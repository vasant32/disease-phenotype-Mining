Popliteal pterygium syndrome is rare, with 50 cases described in the literature. Three additional cases are reported. The syndrome includes a popliteal web extending from the ischium to the heel associated with toenail dysplasia, eventual deformities of the foot and toes, and oral cavity abnormalities, such as cleft palate or lip pits. The main orthopedic problem is a severe flexion contracture of the knee and an equinus foot. Surgical treatment consists of resection of the web. A technical problem emerges on liberating or reconstructing the sciatic nerve or its branches, which are sometimes included within the contracted cord.
