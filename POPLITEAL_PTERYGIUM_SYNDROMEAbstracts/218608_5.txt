Two cases of ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum in siblings are presented. One sib had associated cleft lip and palate, the other had bilateral syndactyly of the second and third toes. Father, paternal grandmother, and great-grandmother all had bilateral syndactyly of the second and third toes. Cases of ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum reported in the ophthalmic literature are reviewed as are cases of ankyloblepharon occurring as part of the popliteal pterygium syndrome. It is postulated that the association of ankyloblepharon with other abnormalities may be part of the spectrum of the popliteal pterygium syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity.
