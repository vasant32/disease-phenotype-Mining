Congenital causes of limited mouth opening involving fusion of maxilla and mandible (syngnathia) are rare anomalies that often present as part of syndromes such as Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndrome. Surgical management involves division of the bony fusion or breakdown of the adhesions in the first few days of life. The authors present a case of maxillo-mandibulo-zygomatic fusion (syngnathia) in an 8-year-old boy, who underwent surgical intervention to achieve adequate jaw function.
