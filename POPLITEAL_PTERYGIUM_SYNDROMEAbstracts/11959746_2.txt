OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the use of MR imaging in the evaluation of the positions of the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve in children with popliteal pterygium syndrome for preoperative planning and to describe the typical appearance of popliteal pterygium on MR imaging. CONCLUSION: By depicting the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve either in normal positions or abnormally located immediately adjacent to the pterygium, MR imaging provides useful information for preoperative planning in children with popliteal pterygium syndrome. The MR appearance of a popliteal pterygium is that of a band of abnormal tissue extending from the ischium to the os calcis that has signal characteristics of fibrous tissue often attached to a belly of anomalous muscle.
