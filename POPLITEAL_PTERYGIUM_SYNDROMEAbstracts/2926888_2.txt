We report a case of the popliteal pterygium syndrome resulting in abnormalities of the external genitalia and testicular ectopia. Management included bilateral orchiopexy and complex genitoplasty. Pterygia represent errors in development that manifest as webs across joints and can result in anomalies of the external genitalia. The genitourinary aspects of the popliteal pterygium syndrome and their management are discussed.
