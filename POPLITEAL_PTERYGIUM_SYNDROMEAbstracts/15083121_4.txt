Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS) is a rare genetic disorder that represents the association of a popliteal web with a combination of craniofacial, genitourinary, and extremity malformations. The management of fixed flexion deformity of the knee resulting from popliteal webbing, is of prime interest to the orthopaedist. The degree of popliteal webbing varies greatly. Due to this variable expression, various modalities to treat popliteal webbing exist. The presence of a short sciatic nerve in the free edge of a popliteal pterygium, is a limiting factor in surgical correction of this deformity. The popliteal web is typically the most difficult orthopaedic problem. The purpose of this report is to discuss the orthopaedic management of popliteal pterygium in eight patients.
