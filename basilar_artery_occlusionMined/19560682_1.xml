<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> remains a significant clinical problem, and no reproducible animal model has been established to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the vertebrobasilar distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a study designed to pilot test a novel model of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rabbits, created by selective endovascular occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in 8 New Zealand white rabbits by injection of the autologous clot through the microcatheter positioned within the distal vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into subgroups (I and II) based on the length of produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (3 and 6 hours, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the intracranial vessels were performed before the procedure, and at 3 hours after induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for groups I and II, with continued imaging up to 6 hours for group II, with diffusion-weighted images acquired approximately every 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed at the end of the 3-hour (group I) or 6-hour (group II) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was successfully induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, with pathological changes documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The earliest changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> diffusion-weighted images were identified at only 4.5 hours of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a reproducible model of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be induced in rabbits using selective endovascular occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The availability of such a model, integrated with state-of-the-art imaging techniques, holds promise for preclinical investigations of emergent therapeutic approaches in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
