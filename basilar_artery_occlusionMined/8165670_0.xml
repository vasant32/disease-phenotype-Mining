<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using color-coded duplex carotid ultrasonography, we measured the time-averaged mean and end-diastolic flow velocities with incident angle correction in 130 bilateral vertebral arteries between the C3 and C6 segments of the spine in 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with or without occlusive diseases in the vertebrobasilar circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The site of occlusion was confirmed by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects included 12 patients with unilateral subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (SA group), 11 patients with unilateral occlusion at the origin of the vertebral artery (V1 group), 6 patients with unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> before the branching of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (V2 group), 14 patients with unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after the branching of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (V3 group), 5 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BA group), 5 patients with unilateral posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> group), and 12 patients without any occlusive lesions in the vertebrobasilar circulation (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group the mean and end-diastolic blood flow velocities were 25.5 +/- 6.9 cm/s and 16.2 +/- 4.3 cm/s, respectively, and the side-to-side differences of these velocities were 4.8 +/- 5.2 cm/s and 4.7 +/- 4.1 cm/s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the SA group demonstrated retrograde flow on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the V1 group no flow signals were detected on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the V2 group the mean velocity (7.2 +/- 3.1 cm/s) was lower than in the control group, and the end-diastolic velocity was zero on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the V3 group the mean and end-diastolic velocities (11.5 +/- 3.1 cm/s and 5.9 +/- 2.8 cm/s, respectively) on the occluded side were lower than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities on the unaffected side were higher than those on the affected side in the SA, V1, V2, and V3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in flow velocity between the control, BA, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of vertebral artery blood flow velocity may help in localizing the site of occlusion in the subclavian and vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
