<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multimodal rescue therapy combining mechanical disruption and platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may improve recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who did not recanalize with thrombolysis were treated with GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, angioplasty, or an embolectomy device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was individualized based on vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism, patient status, and symptom duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated within 3.8+/-2.2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 19.4+/-4.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had carotid terminus occlusion, whereas 5 had middle cerebral artery and 1 had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average doses of intraarterial tPA and reteplase were 17.1+/-8.6 mg and 2+/-0.6 units, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received either an intravenous or intraarterial abciximab bolus (mean 11.8+/-5.8 mg) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (mean 3278+/-1716U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven were treated with angioplasty and 4 had mechanical embolectomy or stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete (8) or partial (3) recanalization was achieved in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
