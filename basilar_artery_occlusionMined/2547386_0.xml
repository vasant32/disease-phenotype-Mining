<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RGH-2202 caused qualitatively similar effects to TRH in a variety of tests for the activity on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The compound as well as TRH increased the spontaneous motor activity, enhanced the conditioned avoidance response, and antagonized the avoidance suppression by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and the sleep-inducing effect of pentorbarbital in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also efficacious against the deficits of consciousness in mice with concussive head injury and the EEG disturbance in rats with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, it antagonized the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>-or <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> and enhanced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> of exploratory activity in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemically, it enhanced, like TRH, the turnover of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum of mice and rats, and increased cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> levels in the cerebellum of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of the global similarity between the pharmacological profiles of RGH-2202 and TRH, there were some intriguing differences between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RGH-2202 was 2-5 times more effective than TRH in improving the deficits of active avoidance performance and retention in mice, while it was weaker than TRH in modifying the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002822'>catalepsy</z:mp> in mice and enhancing the spinal reflexes in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides, its thyrotropin releasing activity was about 30 times less potent than that of TRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
