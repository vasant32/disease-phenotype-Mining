<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> BAO is a devastating neurological condition associated with a poor clinical outcome and a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recanalization has been identified as a major prognostic factor for good outcome in BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stents is an emerging treatment option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First clinical trials using stent retrievers have shown promising high recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these studies mainly included large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> in the anterior circulation with only a few or single cases of BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stent in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with BAO undergoing endovascular therapy using retrievable stents (Solitaire FR Revascularization Device) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional multimodal treatment approaches included thromboaspiration, intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/ permanent stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rates after multimodal therapy and stent retrieval were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome and mortality were assessed 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median patient age was 64.5 years (range 55-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median NIHSS score at presentation was 21 (range 5-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, successful recanalization (TICI 3 or 2b) was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (TICI 3 in 78.6%, 11/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients (28.6%), insufficient recanalization after stent retrieval was due to an underlying atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additional deployment of a permanent intracranial stent was performed in 3 patients (21.4%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> alone in 1 patient (7.1%), resulting in final TICI 3 in 1 patient and TICI 2b in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stent retrieval alone was performed in 4 patients (28.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Average number of device passes was 1.3 (range 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Median procedure time to maximal recanalization was 47 minutes (range 10-252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No device-related complications or thromboembolic occlusion of a previously unaffected artery occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was no symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was observed in 28.6% (4/14); overall mortality was 35.7% (5/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal endovascular approach using retrievable stents in BAO has high recanalization rates, with very low complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Underlying atherothrombotic stenotic lesions of the basilar artery may still necessitate additional permanent stent placement to achieve complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
