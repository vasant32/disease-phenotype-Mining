<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast-enhanced transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) is a promising tool for the evaluation of brain circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess the diagnostic ability of conventional and contrast-enhanced TCCS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and to compare the findings with those of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively performed conventional and contrast-enhanced TCCS within 3 days before or after digital subtraction angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in 62 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assigned the patients to two groups on the basis of angiographic findings: basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> group (n = 7) and control group without basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained basilar artery flow images showing the direction of blood flow using TCCS through a suboccipital window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, the detection rate of basilar artery flow using conventional and contrast-enhanced TCCS was 76.4% and 98.2%, respectively (P &lt;.001), and the flow direction was antegrade in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> group, neither conventional nor contrast-enhanced TCCS could obtain flow images of the proximal basilar artery in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five patients with proximal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a reversed flow image in the distal basilar artery obtained by contrast-enhanced TCCS was confirmed by angiography to be blood supply through collateral circulation from the carotid systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, two patients with distal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not have this sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced TCCS is more sensitive in imaging basilar artery flow than is conventional TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When examined with contrast-enhanced TCCS, a combination of absent basilar artery flow and the reversed basilar artery flow sign may be a diagnostic indicator of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
