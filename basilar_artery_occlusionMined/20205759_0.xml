<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first case of transient basilar occlusive disease diagnosed and monitored by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case is important and needs to be reported because transient basilar occlusion may be easily diagnosed if transcranial Doppler is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old woman affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and not treated with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, cardioverted to sinus rhythm during a gastric endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She then showed a sudden-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, horizontal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertical gaze palsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000616'>miosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hours later, the symptoms resolved quickly, leaving no residual neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler examination showed a dampened flow in the basilar artery in the emergency examination and a restored flow when the symptoms resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first case of transient basilar occlusive disease diagnosed and monitored by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that transcranial Doppler should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, in particular, if associated with signs of brainstem dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
