<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrating extensive brainstem involvement has been shown to predict a poor outcome regardless of reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI at presentation demonstrated significant DWI abnormality in the majority of the bilateral pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was endovascularly recanalized 8 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and the patient had a marked clinical recovery with no deficit at 3 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding of brainstem DWI reversibility cautions against the use of DWI to select ABAO patients for intra-arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of apparent diffusion coefficient reduction on pretreatment MRI may not adequately identify which DWI abnormal brainstem tissue is potentially reversible </plain></SENT>
