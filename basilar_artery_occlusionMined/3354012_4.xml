<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The earliest changes on magnetic resonance images were an absence of signal void in the basilar artery suggestive of severe reduction of blood flow or occlusion (flow-void phenomena) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presumed basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was best demonstrated as a linear structure isointense or hyperintense with the brainstem in the pontine cistern on T1-weighted parasagittal images and as either absence of flow-void phenomena or higher signal intensity at various levels corresponding to the course of the basilar artery on the axial T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brainstem parenchymal changes characteristic of infarction were not obvious for at least 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or 90 minutes after latest progression of symptoms and were best shown by both axial and coronal T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these magnetic resonance imaging findings may allow earlier diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
