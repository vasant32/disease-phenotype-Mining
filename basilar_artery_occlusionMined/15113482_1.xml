<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: To describe a novel therapeutic approach (endovascular basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) to a notoriously difficult-to-manage clinical condition (actively symptomatic high-grade basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) on the basis of assessment of the patient-specific mechanism of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> refractory to aggressive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed a high-grade proximal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical presentation and angiographic findings, the pathogenesis of this complex of symptoms was thought to be embolic rather than hemodynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Endovascular coil occlusion of the basilar artery was used, with excellent outcome (cessation of ischemic symptoms and independent level of functioning at 1 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Successful endovascular management of intracranial occlusive disease requires understanding of the mechanism responsible for the patient's symptoms </plain></SENT>
