<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several problems have been reported, such as incomplete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, their growth or rupture, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> originating from their cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since hemodynamic changes after occlusion therapy are suspected to be responsible for these phenomena, they were investigated by a hydraulic vascular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hydraulic vascular model of the vertebrobasilar artery was constructed with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> and glass tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A glass-made sphere of 2.5 cm in diameter was attached to the model and was regarded as a basilar head <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 40% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> solution at 25 degrees C was found to be of similar viscosity and specific gravity to those of human whole blood at 37 degrees C and was perfused in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A device to measure intra-aneurysmal clearance was made from a stable luminous source and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37130">Cds</z:chebi> photocell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good correlation was found between the output and an intra-aneurysmal dye concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dye was injected into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and its half-life was calculated from clearance curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was then regarded as an index of stagnation in an aneurysmal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The flow volumes were estimated as: 60ml/min to the territory of one posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and 80ml/min to the cerebellum and the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Half-life was recorded in the following conditions: 120ml/min of flow in the basilar artery (BA) into bilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> stimulating the condition before BA occlusion, and various flow values (60ml/min to 10ml/min) of P1 segment simulating the conditions after BA occlusion distal to the superior cerebellar artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
