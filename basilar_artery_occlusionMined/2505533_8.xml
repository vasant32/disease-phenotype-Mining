<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparative angiography was available in 13 cases (although in some cases the studies were separated by a number of months) and duplex sonography in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After localization of the carotid artery bifurcations by using 2DFT projection phase-contrast angiography, multiple 1.25-mm contiguous images were obtained with the 3DFT technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the lesions were identified on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because flow is detected in a manner that is independent of flow-induced phase shifts in the 3DFT time-of-flight technique, signal loss arising from complex flow and turbulence is minimized, yet the flow image remains sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> velocity components of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applications of this technique are ideal for relatively straight vessels where flow is laminar, but it can also be used to evaluate the carotid artery bifurcations where flow becomes complex </plain></SENT>
