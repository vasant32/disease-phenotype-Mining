<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is a clinical event with an exceedingly high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved survival is closely associated with successful recanalization of the occluded basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BVAO) is a unique disease entity that effectively denies any direct access to the basilar artery for endovascular rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of successful intra-arterial basilar artery thrombolysis in a patient with BVAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man was transferred to our hospital after intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator and with deteriorating neurological status requiring intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His clinical presentation was highly suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral angiogram showed a BVAO and collateral flow reconstituting both distal extracranial vertebral arteries but with significant contrast stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no retrograde filling of the basilar artery through the only angiographically visible posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Selective catheterizations of the left occipital artery and the left ascending cervical branch of the thyrocervical trunk were performed to deliver a total of 12 mg of tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At that point, the patient showed significant neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post-tissue plasminogen activator angiogram showed improved flow through the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient was independent and well at his 1-year follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Knowledge of potential collateral pathways is important when direct access to the main intracranial vessels is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery thrombolysis through collateral vessels is clinically effective when a direct approach to the artery is not feasible </plain></SENT>
