<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is usually because of their complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and location next to the skull base and brain stem, where proximal vascular control is usually not attainable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients at our institution underwent intraoperative transfemoral catheterization of the basilar artery with a nondetectable endovascular balloon for proximal control of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The flow control in the basilar artery was excellent and facilitated the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, each patient underwent the placement of a 10-cm 8-French femoral introducer sheath and were taken to the operating room where they were placed in a supine position and a subtemporal or pterional craniotomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the initial exposure and before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> manipulation, a nondetachable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon catheter was passed through an introducer catheter and was placed into the rostral basilar artery, using flow direction, microguidewires, and angiographic "road-mapping" techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, temporary basilar occlusion was used to collapse the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and to facilitate clip placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the third patient, intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture occurred and was controlled by temporary basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using intraoperative angiography, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration and vessel patency was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique achieves intraoperative control of the basilar artery proximal to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by the use of a nondetachable occlusive balloon in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An added benefit is the ease with which intraoperative angiography can be obtained in this context.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
