<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fast recanalization of the vessel is the mainstay of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recanalization may be achieved by intravenous or intra-arterial administration of thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These procedures are currently used as life-saving interventions, despite the low level of evidence supporting their efficacy, because of the bad prognosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis may be started earlier, but it is less often used, mainly for historic reasons; intra-arterial measures are possibly more effective in achieving recanalization but require extra time before they can be started and demand a considerable amount of resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery does not recanalize in approximately one third of patients; this result has not been modified over the past two decades by these treatments and probably will not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined mechanical and intra-arterial thrombolysis may be more efficient in achieving basilar artery recanalization, but the impact of this combined intervention on the final outcome has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because time is critical, as in every <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, implementation of a specific treatment protocol for this condition, including one of the aforementioned treatments, and eventual transfer to a secondary-care unit will save time and improve prognosis </plain></SENT>
