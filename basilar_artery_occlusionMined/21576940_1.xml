<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate our first results using a new device for mechanical thrombectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 2009 and September 2010 a new device for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy (The Penumbra Systemâ„¢; Penumbra Inc., Alameda, Calif., USA) was used in 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of these patients' medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient received endovascular treatment without intravenous (IV) thrombolysis because of infarction on the initial CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 12 patients received IV thrombolysis with rtPA followed by endovascular thrombectomy according to a bridging concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After thrombolysis, the basilar artery was patent in 1 patient (9%), partially recanalized in 3 (27%) and still occluded in 7 (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The endovascular device could not access in 2 patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 10 patients, the patency rate after thrombectomy was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall patency rate after treatment was 9 of 12 (75%) at the time of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale improved from a median of 27 to a median of 18 after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients died (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survivors had a mean modified Rankin Scale before discharge of 2.3 (range 0-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A bridging therapy with the combination of IV thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy seems to be a promising therapy strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results confirm the advantage of the additional use of this new thrombectomy device, working with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, with a satisfactory patency rate and a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
