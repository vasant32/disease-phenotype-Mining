<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one patient with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> thrombolytic treatment was initiated 12 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients with angiographically verified occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, the treatment was initiated approximately 4.5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 80-120 mg, was infused intra-arterially over 90-100 min via a catheter the tip of which was close to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This regimen resulted in recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients; however, in two patients it was verified by repeat CT scan only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients the thrombolytic treatment was successful (the patients improved clinically); the third patient died of massive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients did significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or other obvious side-effects occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From this preliminary report it is concluded that angiographically proven thrombolytic recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> is possible with rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some patients, however, the treatment is initiated too late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the possible indication for thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is needed </plain></SENT>
