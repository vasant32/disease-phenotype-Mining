<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial thrombolysis are therapeutic options; however, the clinical outcomes remain poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate feasibility, safety, and efficacy of emergency stent placement following intra-arterial thrombolysis for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six consecutive patients were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO using intra-arterial therapy from September 2004 to October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients, with a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score ranging from 8 to 12, underwent emergency stent placement following inadequate revascularization after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological status prior to treatment was evaluated using the GCS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days post-treatment were used to assess functional outcome and we reviewed clinical records for frequency of procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stents were deployed at the target lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful revascularization was achieved in eight of nine (88.9%) patients (residual stenosis &lt;50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median GCS score prior to thrombolysis was 9 (range: 6-12) and prior to stent placement was 10 (range: 8-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (44.4%) achieved good outcomes as determined by the mRS scale (0-2 at 90 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 33.3% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures with one patient (11.1%) experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intrastent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient developed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Data from our small case series demonstrates that emergency stent placement following intra-arterial thrombolysis is a feasible treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO and may reduce mortality and prevent re-occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
