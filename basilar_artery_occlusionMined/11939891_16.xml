<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is associated with a high mortality rate, although cases with spontaneous favorable outcomes have recently been reported, and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (BAS) has received little consideration until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the prognostic clinical factors by testing numerous combinations of admission status characteristics of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> caused by BAO or BAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review from the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry (group 1) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> caused by BAS less than 50% or BAO as diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography who were not treated by thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic findings on admission were correlated with outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical patterns associated with poor outcomes in group 1 with those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who died from BAO or BAS (confirmed at autopsy) (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in group 1 (35/43) was poor (severe disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) in 54% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis revealed that 4 factors-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034124" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary disorders</z:e>, lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001291'>cranial nerve involvement</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009792" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">consciousness disorders</z:e> on admission-were strongly (P&lt;.001) associated with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that the outcome was poor in 100% of cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009792" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">consciousness disorders</z:e> or the combination of the remaining 3 factors were present, whereas in the absence of these factors, a poor outcome was reported in only 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 87% of the 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in group 2, the same clinical patterns were present on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of BAS greater than 50% or BAO is diverse and certain clinical characteristics seem to predict a lower risk of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their presence may help to decide the most suitable therapy </plain></SENT>
