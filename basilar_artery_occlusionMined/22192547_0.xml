<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the safety, recanalization rate and time-to-flow restoration of mechanical clot disruption and low dose urokinase (UK) infusions for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between June 2006 and June 2010, 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO underwent endovascular treatment that included angioplasty or stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time to treatment, duration of the procedure, dose of urokinase (UK), recanalization rates and symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measures were assessed at admission and at the time of discharge using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score and at three months after treatment using the modified Rankin Score (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On admission, the median NIHSS score was 13.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to arrival at hospital was 356 minutes, and median time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to intraarterial thrombolysis (IAT) was 49 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used the following interventional treatment regimens: Intra-arterial (IA) UK and a minimal mechanical procedure (n=14), IA UK with angioplasty (n=1), IA UK with angioplasty and stent placement (n=3) and IA UK with HyperForm (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recanalization (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> grade II or III) rate was 90.5% (19/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in one patient (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS score at discharge was 6.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three-month outcome was favorable (mRS: 0-2) for 14 patients (66.7%) and poor (mRS: 3-6) for seven patients (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality at three months was 14.3% (three patients died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low-dose IAT with mechanical clot disruption is a safe and effective treatment for treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO </plain></SENT>
