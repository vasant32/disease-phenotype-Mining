<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images of 10 patients with pontine infarction were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 examinations were performed on a 1.5 Tesla high-field scanner (GE) within two weeks after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infarcted area was detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> as early as 20 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained in two cases three and nine hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore suggested that follow-up study should be performed when initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images within 20 hours postictus are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted images at four, nine and twelve days after ictus were interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of these three examinations, the infarcted areas were clearly demonstrated as hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other examination, however, an area of mildly increased signal intensity was seen on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that the fogging effect is also observed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and that a small pontine infarction may be overlooked during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was detected as an absence-of-flow void in three of the ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging proved to be a relatively useful diagnostic modality for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> pontine infarctions </plain></SENT>
