<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcranial pulsed Doppler (2 MHZ) velocity detection method developed by R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aaslid now offers such possibilities, although it has not yet been validated in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors relate their experience and methodological criteria (patient's position, deepness of access, flow direction, response to compression tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They conducted 2 studies, one bearing on the detection of 14 cases of 75% stenosis of the superior segment, or of arteriographically-confirmed endocranial vertebral/basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; the other one was concerned with assessing the basilar hemodynamic consequences of vertebral-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 17 steal syndrome cases, of which 5 were symptomatic (4 pre-steal cases, 7 permanent, 6 intermittent), basilar flow determined spontaneously or following postischemic hyperemic test of the upper limb, was moderately changed in 30% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial pulsed Doppler ultrasonic examination could be recommended in addition to the regular echo-Doppler velocity detection test, and thus contribute to exploring and monitoring transient or full-blown ischemic accidents of the vertebrobasilar circulation, in expectation of medical, surgical or angioplastic management </plain></SENT>
