<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) are based on case series and data that have been extrapolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> intervention trials in other cerebrovascular territories, and information on the efficacy of different treatments in unselected patients with BAO is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed outcomes and differences in treatment response after BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) is a prospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic and radiologically confirmed BAO between November 1, 2002, and October 1, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity at time of treatment was dichotomised as severe (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in state</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo>) or mild to moderate (any deficit that was less than severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 4 or 5, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment they received: antithrombotic treatment only (AT), which comprised antiplatelet drugs or systemic anticoagulation; primary intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), including subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis; or intra-arterial therapy (IAT), which comprised thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, stenting, or a combination of these approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios (RR) for treatment effects were adjusted for age, the severity of neurological deficits at the time of treatment, time to treatment, prodromal minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, location of the occlusion, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 619 patients were entered in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>27 patients were excluded from the analyses because they did not receive AT, IVT, or IAT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 592 patients who were analysed, 183 were treated with only AT, 121 with IVT, and 288 with IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 402 (68%) of the analysed patients had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant superiority was found for any treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with outcome after AT, patients with a mild-to-moderate deficit (n=245) had about the same risk of poor outcome after IVT (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60-1.45) or after IAT (adjusted RR 1.29, 0.97-1.72) but had a worse outcome after IAT compared with IVT (adjusted RR 1.49, 1.00-2.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with AT, patients with a severe deficit (n=347) had a lower risk of poor outcome after IVT (adjusted RR 0.88, 0.76-1.01) or IAT (adjusted RR 0.94, 0.86-1.02), whereas outcomes were similar after treatment with IAT or IVT (adjusted RR 1.06, 0.91-1.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Most patients in the BASICS registry received IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results do not support unequivocal superiority of IAT over IVT, and the efficacy of IAT versus IVT in patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO needs to be assessed in a randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
