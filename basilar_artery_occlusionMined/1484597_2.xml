<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We presented a case of a distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 66-year-old female was found unconscious at home and transferred to our hospital in a deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> on February 9, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emergency CT scan revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated conservatively because of her poor neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiograms performed on February 13 showed occlusion of the basilar artery and a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the cortical branch of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contrast material remained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> for a long time throughout the venous phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left vertebral artery was markedly hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient improved remarkably after admission and became almost alert late in February, although she still presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo>, dysfunction of lower cranial nerves and other neurological signs linked with the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unusual angiographical findings in this case prompted us to perform the examination again, expecting some angiographical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The angiograms taken on March 15 revealed spontaneous disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, although the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors discussed some problems involved in this case, including the relation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, and the mechanism of spontaneous disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
