<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Timely vessel revascularization is critical to improve the clinical outcome in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients survives <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion with mild or no disability and some of these individuals develop recurrent ischemic events despite optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strategy for management of these patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: We described 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intracranial vertebrobasilar occlusions who presented with recurrent ischemic symptoms and progressive disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients were treated successfully with angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> postprocedure and was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which was self-limiting without need for intervention or result in permanent neurological sequela </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients have been free of recurrent symptoms for up to 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar occlusions is technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the high-risk nature, it should be reserved as an option only for selected group of patients with recurrent ischemic symptoms and progressive disability despite maximal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further prospective study is helpful to clarify the role of this intervention </plain></SENT>
