<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The frequent use of a longer time window for recanalization therapy in patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) in daily practice is not supported by any scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between time to recanalization therapy and functional outcome in BAO with data from the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BASICS is a prospective multicenter registry of patients (n=619) with radiologically confirmed BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the interval between estimated time of BAO and start of recanalization therapy: ≤3 hours (n=134), &gt;3 to ≤6 hours (n=151), &gt;6 to ≤9 hours (n=56), and &gt;9 hours (n=68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measure was poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale score 4-6) after 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated adjusted risk ratios with 95% CIs using Poisson regression analyses with the ≤3 hours group as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had an increased risk of poor functional outcome as time to recanalization therapy became longer (≤3 hours: 62%; &gt;3 to ≤6 hours: 67% [adjusted risk ratio, 1.06; 0.91-1.25]; &gt;6 to ≤9 hours: 77% [adjusted risk ratio, 1.26; 1.06-1.51]; &gt;9 hours: 85% [adjusted risk ratio, 1.47; 1.26-1.72]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recanalization therapy in patients with BAO is associated with a more favorable outcome with a significant increased chance of a poor outcome when recanalization therapy is started &gt;6 hours after estimated time of BAO </plain></SENT>
