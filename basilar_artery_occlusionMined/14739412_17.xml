<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar studies have not been reported with posterior circulation occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with intra-arterial thrombolytics were studied with multimodal MRI before treatment, several hours after treatment, and at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients were studied (9 men, 1 woman) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 70 years, and median pretreatment National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients imaged before treatment and at day 7, mean pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume was 11 cm(3), and day 7, lesion volume was 2.6 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant mismatch was visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with pretreatment perfusion-diffusion imaging (mean, 73%; range, 49% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late imaging obtained in 4 of these 5 patients demonstrated that mean posttreatment DWI lesion volume (21 cm(3)) was less than the mean initial perfusion lesion volume (62 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there was no direct correlation between pretreatment DWI volume and initial NIHSS (r=-0.113), there was good correlation between pretreatment perfusion-weighted imaging volume and initial NIHSS (r=0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this first report of diffusion-perfusion MRI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis, significant mismatch was visualized on pretreatment studies, suggesting that large volumes of salvageable tissue were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were smaller than pretreatment perfusion volumes, suggesting that substantial volumes of tissue were salvaged by thrombolytic reperfusion </plain></SENT>
