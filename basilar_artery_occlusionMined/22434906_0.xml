<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most studies of the treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion focus on intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis whereas data on mechanical thrombectomy as the preferred treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, data are presented on 28 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy as the preferred treatment for basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion at the Karolinska University Hospital from September 2005 to November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score of â‰¤2 at 3-8 months after thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 28 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, the proportion reaching a favorable outcome was 57% (95% CI 37% to 75%), and if there were no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction prior to treatment the proportion was 73% (95% CI 50% to 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 21% died (95% CI 8% to 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results for mechanical thrombectomy for basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were superior to those presented previously for intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that mechanical thrombectomy is a method distinct from therapies based on thrombolysis and that any randomized clinical trial on treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion must consider mechanical thrombectomy as a separate entity </plain></SENT>
