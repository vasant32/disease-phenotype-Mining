<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the ability of systematic combined noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT)/computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging, firstly to provide a neurologic prognosis and secondly to ensure early detection of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO), in unexplained nontraumatic impaired consciousness management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Combined NCCT/CTA imaging was performed on 65 patients with impaired consciousness and no history of trauma prospectively over 14 months in a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were assessed based on visual and quantitative criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis aimed to identify the prognostic value of combined NCCT/CTA imaging and its ability for early BAO detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study shows that combined NCCT/CTA imaging was a significant predictor of poor neurological outcome, with a positive predictive value of 94.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination was also crucial for early detection of BAO, given that 42.8% of cases were misdiagnosed with NCCT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> represented 10.8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unexplained nontraumatic impaired consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systematic combined NCCT/CTA imaging is an efficient tool for predicting poor neurologic prognosis in cases of unexplained nontraumatic impaired consciousness and is also essential for detecting BAO </plain></SENT>
