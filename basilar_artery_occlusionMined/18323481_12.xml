<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is poor if early recanalization is not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recanalization strategies include intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial thrombolysis, as well as endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of IVT with consecutive on-demand EMT may allow for early treatment initiation with high recanalization rates but has never been systematically tested in patients with BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Starting in January 2006, we treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO admitted to our academic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center or one of our cooperating community hospitals after a standardized protocol combining IVT with consecutive on-demand EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were: (1) presence of predefined symptoms clearly suggestive of BAO; (2) exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> on CT scan; (3) evidence of BAO on CT angiography; (4) start of therapy within 6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; and (5) no contraindications for IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If CT angiography showed persistent BAO after IVT, EMT was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since January 2006, 16 patients have been treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received IVT; in 7 of them, EMT became necessary because of persistent BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final recanalization was achieved in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three months after therapy, 12 of 16 patients were still alive; 7 of them had a good outcome (modified Rankin score &lt;or=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the combination of IVT with on-demand consecutive EMT in BAO is feasible, allows for early treatment, and provides excellent recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
