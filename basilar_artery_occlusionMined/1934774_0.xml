<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 66.7 years and the final clinicopathological diagnosis were <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the basilar artery (BA) in 15 patients and embolism in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of the BA was contiguous to that of the vertebral artery in ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, the occlusion was localized to the caudal portion of the BA in two, to the middle portion in six, and extended to the rostral portion in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was restricted to the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusions of the middle portion were observed in four and that of rostral portion in two; in the other two patients, the whole BA was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, there was no occlusion in the vertebro-basilar artery at the postmortem examination, but infarctions of the base of pons, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and occipital lobes were confirmed, suggesting recanalization of the occluded BA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Involvements of the area supplied by the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) were found in seventeen, while that of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) only in ten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> supplied by both SCA and PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These facts suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> are rather frequent and the SCA areas are more involved than those of the PICA in fatal patients with occlusion of the BA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
