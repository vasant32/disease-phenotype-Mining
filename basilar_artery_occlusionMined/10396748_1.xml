<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (mean age: 67.1 years) with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic computed tomography functional images (FID-CT) were analysed to determine whether this method could diagnose BAO in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional images were categorized into 3 groups: (1) group A (n = 5) showed abnormalities on corrected mean transit time (cMTT) images and time-to-peak (TP) images in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and in the thalamus, (2) group B (n = 6) only showed abnormalities on TP images, and (3) group C (n = 2) had no abnormalities on either cMTT or TP images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group C patients had poor time-density curves because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the results may sometimes be false negative and this limitation should be kept in mind, FID-CT seem to be useful not only for defining patients who need angiography but also those who need thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO </plain></SENT>
