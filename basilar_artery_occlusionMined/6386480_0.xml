<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated 6,380 patients with directional c-w Doppler sonography within the last 3 1/2 years, and have suspected obstruction of the basilar artery or of both distal vertebral arteries in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Either bilateral sonographic silence or an absent diastolic flow component of the vertebral arteries were employed as criteria in the sonographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography of the vertebro-basilar system, performed in 6 cases, confirmed the diagnoses: basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was found in 4 patients, 1 patient revealed tight stenosis of the basilar artery in its entire length, and 1 patient exhibited occlusion of both distal vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three further basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were detected by means of angiography despite initially negative Doppler sonography within the same period of time; 1 of those patients, however, met the above criteria for basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> upon sonographic reevaluation on the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believe that directional c-w Doppler sonography is very useful in the diagnosis of basilar artery obstruction </plain></SENT>
