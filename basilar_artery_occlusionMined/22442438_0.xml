<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple prognostic model to predict outcome at 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) with readily available predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) is a prospective, observational, international registry of consecutive patients who presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic and radiologically confirmed BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We considered predictors available at hospital admission in multivariable logistic regression models to predict poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 4-5 or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used receiver operator characteristic curves to assess the discriminatory performance of the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 619 patients, 429 (69%) had a poor outcome at 1 month: 74 (12%) had a mRS score of 4, 115 (19%) had a mRS score of 5, and 240 (39%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main predictors of poor outcome were older age, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, presence of prodromal minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, higher NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, and longer time to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prognostic model that combined demographic data and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This performance improved by including findings from the neurologic examination (AUC 0.79) and CT imaging (AUC 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A risk chart showed predictions of poor outcome at 1 month varying from 25 to 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Poor outcome after BAO can be reliably predicted by a simple model that includes older age, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, presence of prodromal minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, higher NIHSS score, and longer time to treatment </plain></SENT>
