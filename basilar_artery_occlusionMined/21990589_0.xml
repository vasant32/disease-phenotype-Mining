<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> remains one of the most devastating subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous and intra-arterial therapy have altered the natural history of this disease; however, clinical results remain poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, exploring more aggressive and innovative management is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six consecutive patients presenting with a basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with the same general algorithm of intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy with the Merci retrieval system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If complete recanalization was not achieved after two passes, manual syringe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> through a 4.3F catheter was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> interventions utilizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy resulted in recanalization, with five out of six cases displaying TIMI3/TICI3 flow and one patient resulting in complete recanalization of the basilar artery with persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in one P2 segment (TIMI2/TICI2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived, with five out of six independent in activities of daily living at 3 months (mRS 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our small case series indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy performed manually through a 4.3F catheter can facilitate recanalization of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with acceptable clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
