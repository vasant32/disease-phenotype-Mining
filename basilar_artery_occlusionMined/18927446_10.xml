<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy within 3 hours, the optimum management of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared intraarterial thrombolysis with the combined bridging approach of intravenous abciximab and intraarterial thrombolysis with rt-PA (bridging therapy) in an observational, longitudinal, monocenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2006, information for 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO were prospectively entered into a local database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for treatment received either intraarterial thrombolysis with rt-PA alone (intraarterial thrombolysis) or were treated with intravenous abciximab and intraarterial rt-PA (bridging therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome parameters were recanalization of the basilar artery according to Trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> criteria, survival, and reduction of severe disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for recanalization, survival, and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 106 patients with confirmed BAO, 87 patients underwent subsequent angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those, 75 patients were identified who received the full treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the bridging group had a better recanalization rate (83.7% vs 62.5%; P=0.03), a higher survival rate (58.1% vs 25%; P=0.01), and a better chance for an outcome with no or only mild to moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3; 34.9% vs 12.5%; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> rates were comparable in both groups (14% in the bridging group vs 18.8%; P=0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors for recanalization were age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR, 6.53; 95% CI, 1.14-37.49), and bridging therapy (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.02 to 11.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Independent prognostic factors for outcome were Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale score at presentation (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03-1.45) and the combination of bridging therapy with successful recanalization (OR, 3.744; 95% CI, 1.04-13.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bridging therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO with intravenous abciximab and intraarterial rt-PA appears to be safe and yields higher recanalization and improved survival rates, as well as an overall improved chance for a better outcome </plain></SENT>
