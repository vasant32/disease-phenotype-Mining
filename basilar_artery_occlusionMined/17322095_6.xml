<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype with poor prognosis, but recanalizing therapies have been reported to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether initial admission to telemedically linked general hospitals with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-center transfer is related to poorer outcome than direct admission to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BAO cases of 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers in Munich and 1 center in Regensburg between March 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004 were included, either if patients were directly admitted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers (n=23) or had initial admission to general hospitals of the telemedical network for integrative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care (TEMPiS) and secondary transfer to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAO was defined as angiographically (CTA, MRI or conventional angiography) confirmed occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline parameters and therapeutic procedures were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-year follow-up was conducted prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differences in baseline parameters were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to first angiography was significantly longer in patients with secondary transfer (mean: 355+/-93 minutes versus 222+/-198 minutes; P&lt;0.01), mainly attributable to transfer duration (mean:156+/-73 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality (22% versus 75%; P&lt;0.01) and 1-year-mortality (30% versus 81%; P&lt;0.01) were lower for patients with direct admission to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent of directly admitted patients versus 13% of patients with secondary transfer (P=0.02) were living at home after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAO patients who were admitted primarily to community hospitals had a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with typical symptoms should have direct access to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers, or may need bridging therapies </plain></SENT>
