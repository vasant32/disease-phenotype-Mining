<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He developed abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and transient left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> at the age of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The episodes were seen 3 times between 4-year-1-month to 5-year-1-month old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transaxial computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple, well-defined but irregularly marginated areas of low density centered in the mid- and upper pons, right cerebral peduncle and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A right vertebral angiogram illustrated the narrowed basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rectus femoris muscle was biopsied at the age of 4-year-1-month which showed marked variation in fiber size, myonecrosis with phagocytosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003687'>central nuclei</z:hpo>, and adipose and connective tissue proliferation, which were consistent with those seen in DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was an incidental event in this particular case or closely related to the disease process of DMD </plain></SENT>
