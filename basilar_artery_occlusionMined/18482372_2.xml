<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CE-TCCS and cerebral angiography were performed in 120 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were angiographically divided into five groups: (1) intracranial arteries (ICA) stenosis but no BA stenosis as intracranial stenosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>) group, (2) both ICA and BA stenoses as internal carotid arteay and basilar arteay stenoses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) group, (3) BA stenosis as basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (BAS) group, (4) BA occlusion as basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) group, and (5) no arterial lesions as Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the peak systolic flow velocity (PSV) of BA using CE-TCCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PSV was highest in the BAS group (n= 9, 206.1 +/- 118.6 cm/sec), followed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> (n= 27, 74.9 +/- 36.1 cm/sec) and Control (n= 70, 58.2 +/- 17.3 cm/sec) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> group had two patients (PSV: 102 cm/sec and 167 cm/sec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity-specificity curve analysis revealed a cutoff PSV of 120 cm/sec to distinguish the BAS group from other groups, and then we calculated sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 64%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of PSV of the BA using CE-TCCS is useful for the identification of BA stenosis </plain></SENT>
