<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis is advocated for treatment but is limited to use at specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes for patients with BAO treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: During 1995 to 2003, 50 consecutive patients with angiographically proven BAO were treated according to an institutional therapy protocol based on intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated at an urban university teaching hospital receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who were considered for thrombolysis in a catchment area of 1.5 million inhabitants in Helsinki, Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Intravenous administration of alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) during a 1-hour infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Basilar artery recanalization determined by magnetic resonance angiography and clinical outcomes at 3 months and at 1 year or longer determined by modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization was studied in 43 patients and verified in 26 (52%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 3 months, 20 patients (40%) had died while 11 had good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2); 12 (24%) reached independence in activities of daily living (Barthel Index score, 95-100), and 6 (16%) were severely disabled (Barthel Index score, 0-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the long term (median follow-up 2.8 years), 15 patients (30%) reached good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) while 23 (46%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of alteplase for patients with BAO appears to be associated with rates of survival, recanalization, and independent functional outcome comparable with those reported with endovascular approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a randomized trial is needed to compare these approaches for treatment of BAO </plain></SENT>
