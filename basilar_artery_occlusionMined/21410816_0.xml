<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The best therapeutic approach in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a combined treatment approach with intravenous (IV) abciximab and intraarterial (IA) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO on CT-angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We treated patients with IV abciximab followed by IA thrombolysis with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was partial or complete recanalization according to thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 2 to 3 flow grades on catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were favorable functional outcome (mRS score ≤3) and mortality at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 20 patients, mean age was 62 ± 13 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score 25.5 (IQR 12-28), and median Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score 7 (IQR 6-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time to IA treatment was 7 ± 2.8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We achieved partial or complete recanalization in 17/20 patients (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 3/20 patients (15%) had a favorable functional outcome and 9/20 patients (45%) were deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with IV abciximab and IA tPA yielded a high recanalization rate in patients with BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, functional outcomes were poor, potentially due to late initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early treatment might improve functional outcome </plain></SENT>
