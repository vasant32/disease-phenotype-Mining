<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the severity of neurological symptoms, the extent of early ischemic damage on pretreatment diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), and the lesion progression or regression on post-treatment MRI can predict functional outcome in patients with BAO treated with IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six BAO patients (13 women, 23 men; mean age 60 years) treated with IAT within 12 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early ischemic damage on DWI was assessed by applying 4 DWI scoring systems, including a proposed DWI score developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter was used for evaluation of lesion dynamics on post-treatment MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of pretreatment DWI, severity of symptoms (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, NIHSS, and Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale, GCS, scores), vessel recanalization, and lesion progression or regression after IAT with clinical outcome at 3 months was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median NIHSS and GCS scores on admission were 17 and 10, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, NIHSS and GCS scores (on admission) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 DWI scores were significantly associated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After regression analysis for each DWI score, the DWI score proposed herein was the only score that remained independently associated with clinical outcome at 3 months (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease in DWI score was observed in 3 of 23 patients with post-IAT MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was significantly associated with lesion regression (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAO patients with less extensive tissue damage on DWI and milder neurological deficits (lower NIHSS and higher GCS) have a better clinical outcome following IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The introduced DWI score reliably quantified the pretreatment ischemic damage and was an independent predictor of functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lesion regression on DWI score after IAT was associated with vessel recanalization (p = 0.44), but had no impact on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
