<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared outcome and recanalization in men and women with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with antithrombotic treatment alone, IVT or combined IVT-IAT, or IAT in the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 389 male and 226 female patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the antithrombotic treatment group, 68 of 111 (61%) men and 47 of 70 (67%) women had a poor outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.24), in the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group, 47 of 77 (61%) men and 24 of 43 (56%) women (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.60), and in the IAT group, 142 of 185 (77%) men and 71 of 102 (70%) women (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not different between men and women in the antithrombotic treatment group (aRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.16), the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.73), or in the IAT group (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insufficient recanalization after combined IVT-IAT or IAT was similar in men and women (23% versus 22%; aRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, no significant gender differences for outcome and recanalization were observed, regardless of treatment modality </plain></SENT>
