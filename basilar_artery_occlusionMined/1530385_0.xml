<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic changes after occlusion therapy are suspected to be responsible for these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is usually difficult to solve these problems or to predict them before operation because multiple factors are related in a complex fashion in a living body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the effective means is to simulate these hemodynamic conditions by a hydraulic vascular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A glass-made sphere of 2.5 cm in diameter was connected to a hydraulic vascular model of the brain and was regarded as a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> so as to evaluate hemodynamic changes after therapeutic occlusion of the parent artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results are as follows: 1) BA occlusion makes intra-aneurysmal dye stagnate and the half-life elongate significantly from 2.5 seconds to 16 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>2) The time gradually increases as the flow volume through P1 segment decreases from 60 ml/min to 20 ml/min, below which it increases drastically </plain></SENT>
