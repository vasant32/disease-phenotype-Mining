<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate reimbursement within the DRG-system ("diagnosis-related groups") compared with traditional reimbursement for interventional therapy of hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reimbursement calculation was prospectively analyzed in two respects for 30 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) of the lower extremity arteries: (1) based on the DRG-system; (2) based on the traditional system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional evaluation was performed for five further, typical vascular procedures on the basis of real documentation and calculation data (stenting of the carotid artery, fibrinolytic therapy of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, stenting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo>, angioplasty of hemodialysis-shunt stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy of an infrapopliteal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our hospital, the introduction of the DRG system would reduce reimbursement by approximately 1100 euro per <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the other vascular radiological procedures can be expected to increase the payments by up to 4500 euro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To minimize imminent reduction of reimbursement for patients with peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, complete documentation and economical patient management is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Payment may increase significantly for patients with the other reported vascular interventional procedures </plain></SENT>
