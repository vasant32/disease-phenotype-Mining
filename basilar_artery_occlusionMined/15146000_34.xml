<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define predictors of recanalisation and clinical outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> treated with local intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vascular risk factors, severity of the neurological deficit graded by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS), and radiological findings were recorded at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome was measured using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) three months later and categorised as favourable (mRS 0-2), poor (mRS 3-5), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (mRS 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 40 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median NIHSS on admission was 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment was 5.5 hours (range 2.3 to 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was favourable in 14 patients (35%) and poor in nine (23%); 17 (42%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two symptomatic cerebral haemorrhages (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalisation of the basilar artery was achieved in 32 patients (80%); it was complete (TIMI grade 3) in 20% and partial (TIMI grade 2) in 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, low NIHSS score on admission (p = 0.002) and vessel recanalisation (p = 0.005) were independent predictors of favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recanalisation occurred more often with treatment within six hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) and when admission computed tomography showed a hyperdense basilar artery sign (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a univariate model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> (p = 0.002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (p = 0.004) were associated with a poor outcome or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline NIHSS on admission and recanalisation of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> predict a favourable outcome after intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early initiation of IAT and the presence of a hyperdense basilar artery sign on CT were associated with a higher likelihood of recanalisation </plain></SENT>
