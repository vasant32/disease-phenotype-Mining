<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients also had arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had signs consistent with pontine infarction; three had a "locked in" syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (five done within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of progression of neurologic symptoms) revealed a linear structure of increased signal intensity in the pontine cistern on T1-weighted parasagittal images and absence of flow void phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense signals at various brain stem levels corresponding to the course of the basilar artery were noted on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple parenchymal abnormalities were noted in the brain stem (six), cerebellum (four), occipital lobes (two), and thalamus (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance performed early in the course of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is a high-yield, safe procedure and might eliminate the need for arteriography </plain></SENT>
