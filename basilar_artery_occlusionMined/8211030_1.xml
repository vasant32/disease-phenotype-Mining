<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Local therapeutic fibrinolysis is considered an efficient and established treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The introduction of newer fibrinolytics along with the development of interventional catheterization techniques have extended its use to previously untreated events such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1989-1991 six patients with basilar and/or middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were treated at the University Hospital, Basel, by superselective local intraarterial infusion of 400,000 U/h urokinase for 1-2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of four patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showed complete remission one year after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third showed no neurological improvement despite angiographic recanalization, and 48 h later suffered a fatal brainstem haemorrhage, while the fourth did not recover from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and succumbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery showed complete recanalization, but one had complete and the other partial neurological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signs of slight systemic fibrinolysis were present but never attained the intensity of systemic therapeutic fibrinolysis as the antiplasmin and fibrinogen values showed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, local therapeutic fibrinolysis contributes to the reduction of mortality and to remission of symptoms in occlusions of basilar artery, and offers some advantage in occlusions of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A definite benefit from the latter will be proved only through large-scale randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The indication for local therapeutic fibrinolysis for thromboses of cerebral arteries requires a careful benefit-risk evaluation, an experienced angiography team and a special infrastructure for computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
