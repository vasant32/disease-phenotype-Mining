<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, intra-arterial thrombolysis or endovascular mechanical recanalization may result in higher recanalization rates than intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients are admitted to community hospitals, where endovascular therapy is usually not readily available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We initiated a "drip, ship, and retrieve" cooperative treatment protocol in 2006, in which thrombolysis was initiated in the community hospital with simultaneous referral to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center and the use of endovascular mechanical recanalization as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients treated by this protocol between 2006 and June 2009 was compared with that of a similar population of referred patients who had received primary intra-arterial therapy with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> bridging at our center between 2003 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, 26 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was 12% in previous patients and 8% in those treated under the new protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rates were similar: 92% in previous patients and 85% with the new protocol; 38% of these had recanalization after intravenous thrombolysis alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was better among those treated with the new protocol, with more patients achieving a modified Rankin scale score &lt; or = 2 (38% versus 12%; P=0.03) and &lt; or = 3 (50% versus 23%; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: "Drip, ship, and retrieve" seems to be feasible and safe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients appear to benefit from initiation of intravenous thrombolysis in the community hospital before transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials will have to confirm the expected benefit of subsequent on-demand mechanical recanalization on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
