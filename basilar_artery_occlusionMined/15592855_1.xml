<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is generally associated with a high mortality rate and a poor functional outcome in survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we encountered a patient with BAO, initially manifesting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and rebound <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, subsequently followed by bilateral sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and terminating in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> state within an interval of 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of his history showed he had had two episodes of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> 2 weeks before the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and the neurological decline of BAO was heralded by the vertiginous symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restated, patients with BAO often have transient vertiginous attacks preceding fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> may be signaling a forthcoming <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event, something that should be considered for clinicians seeing vertiginous patients </plain></SENT>
