<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Territorial cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have mainly a thromboembolic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> less than 2 cm in diameter have recently been reported as nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but it is not clear whether they are low-flow or embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics and causes of territorial and nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a prospective series of 115 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data from 115 consecutive patients with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (79 territorial and 36 nonterritorial [ie, less than 2 cm]), using magnetic resonance imaging (88 patients) and computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and those with nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had similar vascular risk factors and clinical presentations and an equal frequency of cardiac source of embolism (32% versus 42%; P = NS) and of large artery occlusive disease (23% versus 19%; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusive lesions of large arteries at angiography occurred at the level of one cerebellar artery (5% versus 0%; P = NS) and proximal to the ostia of the cerebellar arteries (18% versus 19%; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> distal to occlusive lesions were subdivided into unilateral vertebral artery occlusive disease (presumed artery-to-artery embolic mechanism; 18% versus 5%; P = NS) and low-flow state distal to bilateral vertebral or basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (presumed hemodynamic mechanism; 0% versus 14%; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> (17% versus 1.25%; odds ratio, 15.6 [95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 135]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the remaining patients, the mechanism of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was unknown (34% versus 22%; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> less than 2 cm in diameter (ie, nonterritorial) have the same high rate of embolic mechanism as territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (47% versus 49%; P = NS), have more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, and sometimes have a hemodynamic mechanism </plain></SENT>
