<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose from the basilar apex in 83 cases, the basilar trunk in 46, the vertebrobasilar junction in 35, and the vertebral artery in 37; 87% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were classified as giant lesions (&gt; 2.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 85 upper basilar occlusions, 41 lower basilar occlusions, 29 bilateral vertebral occlusions, and 48 unilateral vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical follow-up period varied from 1 to 23 years, with a mean of 9.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall long-term results were excellent in 68% of the patients, good in 5%, and poor in 3%; 24% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome varied according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> site; excellent or good results were achieved in 64% of the patients with basilar apex, 76% with basilar trunk, 74% with vertebrobasilar junction, and 87% with vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome also varied depending on preoperative grade: 86% of the patients with an excellent presenting grade achieved excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of the posterior communicating arteries was a good predictor of tolerance to basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was achieved in 78% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological status in 26 patients (13%) deteriorated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> occurring within the 1st postoperative week, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or embolism was implicated much more frequently than hemodynamic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in 14 patients, vasospasm in five patients, and surgical trauma in seven patients accounted for additional morbidity in the 1st month following operation; however, many of these patients ultimately made an excellent recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late vertebrobasilar ischemic complications or neurological deterioration from persistent mass effect occurred in 4% of patients with successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 6 weeks to 18 months after arterial ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 43 patients with incompletely thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 67% developed early or late neurological deterioration from SAH, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brain-stem compression</z:hpo>, or brain-stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with 86% of the complications proving fatal </plain></SENT>
