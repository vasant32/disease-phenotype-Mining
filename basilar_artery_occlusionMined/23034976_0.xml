<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has a high mortality and morbidity if recanalization is not achieved before extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An 11-year-old boy presented with a clinical and radiological "top-of-the-basilar" syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered, and the patient was immediately referred to the regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent mechanical thrombectomy using a Solitaire stent (Solitaire FR stent; ev3, Irvine, CA, USA) resulted in clot removal and recanalization of the basilar artery 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient made a full clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge this is the first report on basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a child treated with "bridging" therapy, the combination of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the diagnosis can be made within the time window for intravenous thrombolysis (4.5 hours), the present case suggests that bridging therapy in pediatric basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> can be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
