<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To report results of mechanical disruption or retrieval of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> as first-line treatment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to occlusion of the basilar artery, in particular regarding efficiency and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 12 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to basilar occlusion, mechanical disruption or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> retrieval using various loop-shaped tools was tried before eventually starting local intra-arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main inclusion criteria were: National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &gt;8 or Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;12; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening of symptoms &lt;8 hours; no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> or large hypodensities on computed tomography scan; and occlusion of the basilar artery matching clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficiency included recanalization, procedure time, and r-tPA dose; safety was defined as rate of procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mechanical recanalization was successful in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, possibly attributable to distal embolization, occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 6 remaining patients, the artery was recanalized using r-tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred; 3 patients had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedure time and r-tPA were significantly less in patients with successful mechanical thrombolysis (43.33 minutes and 13.33 mg versus 112.33 minutes and 55.83 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical recanalization was effective in half of the patients and at least as safe as local intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It allowed to save r-tPA and time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the low success rate remains a limit, the excellent and quick anatomical recanalization obtained after successful procedures makes this approach promising </plain></SENT>
