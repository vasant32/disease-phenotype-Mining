<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CT angiography was performed before IV rt-PA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and digital subtraction angiography was undertaken for intra-arterial thrombolysis in cases of no improvement after rt-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five patients were treated with IV rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial CT angiography showed relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization after rt-PA therapy was demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography in 7 of the 31 patients with the occlusion on initial CT angiography: 2/16 in the internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral artery, 3/11 in the distal middle cerebral artery and 2/4 in the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early recanalization rate after IV rt-PA use was very low in cases with large proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT angiography before IV rt-PA may be useful for the prediction of its efficacy </plain></SENT>
