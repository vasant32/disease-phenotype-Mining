<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis may produce recanalization and better clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A short delay between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and thrombolysis is considered essential for successful recanalization and for the smallest possible risk of haemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in an 8-year-old child, which was treated by "clot angioplasty" followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty hours after progressive alteration of consciousness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037823,C0869217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">speech disturbances</z:e> and left arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, the child became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> with decerebrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A CT scan showed parenchymal ischaemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography (performed 36 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) showed a total occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clot angioplasty was performed by placing a balloon catheter within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and inflating it several times in the occluded segment of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was then performed through the balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was only partially recanalized at the end of the procedure, but the perforating arteries of the brain stem had reappeared on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three months later the child had completely recovered to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the very poor natural prognosis of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> requires aggressive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the basilar artery may be performed even late after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clot angioplasty allows partial recanalization, which may increase the efficiency of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
