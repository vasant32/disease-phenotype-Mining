<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two days later she became lethargic and tetraparetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An emergency MRI disclosed multiple infarctions in the medulla oblongata and pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiogram revealed severe stenosis of the rostral basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> course with impaired consciousness and flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images 7 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> disclosed a symmetrical midbrain infarction that was localized mainly in the cerebral peduncles, suggesting a distal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as the cause of this pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since 4 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> the patient was in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, which was essentially unchanged during the 1-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Persistent vegetative state</z:e> is known to be caused by diffuse supratentorial or bilateral thalamic lesions, but in our case the lesions were restricted to the infratentorial area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We speculate a mechanism to cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> by partial impairment of the connection to the thalamic ascending system or extrathalamic ascending system, which leads to the dissociation of arousal(preserved in this case) and awareness(impaired in this case) after the ventral midbrain infarction </plain></SENT>
