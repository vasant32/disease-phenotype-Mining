<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The introduction of flow diverters (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FDs</z:e>) has expanded the possibilities for reconstructive treatment of difficult <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concern remains as to the long-term patency of the perforating arteries and side branches covered during stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of and early effect on covered branches after implantation of the Silk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in the treatment of basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery that was treated by implantation of the Silk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> were included in our retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both unruptured and previously ruptured, formerly untreated, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, patients were monitored for clinical evolution, patency of the covered vessels, and aneurysmal obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2 ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 1 was initially treated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> covered the basilar bifurcation and the origin of a P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery in 9 cases, the origin of the superior cerebellar artery in 9, and of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> a few hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 16 weeks, 3 patients experienced a symptomatic neurologic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the Silk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in the basilar artery was feasible and well tolerated in most cases to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, late ischemic events affecting perforating arteries may occur after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> implantation, suggesting that the indication should be restricted to otherwise untreatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in this location </plain></SENT>
