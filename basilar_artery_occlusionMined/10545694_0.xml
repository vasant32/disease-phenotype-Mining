<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These methods could be helpful in the early classification of vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, thus reserving the use of conventional angiography and possible intra-arterial thrombolysis for patients who had a severe clinical picture explained by preliminary assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 74-year-old woman who experienced a basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; DWI-MRI and 3D TOF Turbo MRA provided noninvasive information concerning the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and its parenchymal ischemic impact, this leading to an intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the feasibility of a noninvasive urgent diagnostic and prognostic approach with DWI-MRI and 3D TOF Turbo MRA in basilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
