<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Multimodal reperfusion therapy (MMRT) has been advocated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ABAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify prognostic factors in patients with ABAO who underwent MMRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from consecutive ABAO patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent MMRT on an emergency basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were categorized according to TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or less and poor outcome as a score of 4 or more at 30 days poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included (18 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 54.7 years (age range, 26-70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients died (25%), and 8 of the surviving 18 patients (44%) achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or less at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We could not identify any clinical or radiological variables that were associated with a greater likelihood of good or poor outcome at 30 days other than the presence of good collateral circulation, which was associated with better outcome on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMRT resulted in high survival and good outcome rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We could not identify prognostic factors in patients with ABAO treated with MMRT other than the presence of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results imply that patients should not be excluded from treatment based on clinical or radiological parameters, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ABAO should be given the chance to benefit from therapy </plain></SENT>
