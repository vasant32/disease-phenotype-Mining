<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We analyzed early diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by applying different lesion scoring systems and determined their predictive value for favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, patients with confirmed basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were entered in a local database. magnetic resonance imaging angiography was performed for diagnosis of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and/or during initiated recanalization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the patients' clinical and radiological baseline data, recanalization, and favorable outcome modified Rankin Scale 0-2 after three-months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted imaging findings were categorized into lesions in vascular territories as well as by two previously published scores for ischemic damage in the posterior circulation, the Renard score and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prognosis Early computed tomography Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> received an early MRI, and in 30 of those, a follow-up MRI was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to baseline MRI was 5·5 h (one-hour to 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median baseline Renard score and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prognosis Early CT Score were 2·75 (0-10) and 7 (0-10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 82% received an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recanalization therapy and in 78% of those, the basilar artery recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median time to therapy was five-hours (1·25-20 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a favorable outcome had a lower Renard score and higher pcASPECTS, a lower rate of complete basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a higher Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale on admission, and a higher rate of successful recanalization (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression, the only independent predictor for favorable outcome was a posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prognosis Early CT Score of 8 or more points (odds ratio 3·9, 95% confidence interval 1·4-11·7, P &lt; 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prognosis Early CT Score of 8 or more points on early diffusion weighted imaging is an independent predictor for favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
