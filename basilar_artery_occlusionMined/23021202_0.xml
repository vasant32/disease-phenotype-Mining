<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Clinical-diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mismatch (CDM) in patients with anterior circulation occlusions is an optional method used to select patients for recanalisation outside the 3-h time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar concept has not been reported with posterior circulation occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CDM was defined as a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score &lt;8 with DWI lesions not located in the dorsal pons, midbrain or thalamus at the time of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were treated with endovascular recanalisation therapy (ERT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment included intra-arterial rt-PA thrombolysis and angioplasty and stenting performed separately or combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recanalisation result was assessed by angiography immediately after the treatment according to the trial reports in the Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Criteria (TIMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complications and outcome 3 months later were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients with a mean age of 66.6 years were included in the study (7 men and 2 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median durations of clinical presentation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> were 31h (range 25-53h) and 6h (range 2-13h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median GCS score at admission was 6 (range 4-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occlusions were located in the proximal basilar artery (BA) (n=2) and the middle BA (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ERT was successful in 8 patients (TIMI 2, n=2 and TIMI 3, n=6) but failed in 1 patient because recanalisation was not possible (TIMI 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No intracranial haemorrhage or dissections occurred during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The recanalised patients recovered consciousness within 9-27h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median GCS score upon discharge was 14 (range 3-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Three months later, 6 patients had a good outcome (modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2), and 2 patients had a moderate outcome (mRS 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient who did not undergo recanalisation died in the rehabilitation hospital 21 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDM may be a valid method for selecting patients with prolonged basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) who are eligible for recanalisation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>ERT was feasible for patients with BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A good clinical outcome was achieved with successful recanalisation </plain></SENT>
