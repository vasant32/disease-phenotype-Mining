<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Present standard therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusions yields poor results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high risk of intracerebral haemorrhage prohibits systemic fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to these facts and good experience in our department with the use of local intracoronary lysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, the method of local thrombolysis was applied in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic therapy was started via an angiography catheter placed in the vertebral artery in a 28 year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and severe brain stem symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient received 200,000 IU streptokinase within 2 hours and subsequently 300,000 IU urokinase within 10 hours </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological symptoms decreased during the following weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on this experience and according to rare reports in the literature we believe local low-dose thrombolysis to be a causal therapy promising success for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This therapy can be carried out in every medical centre able to perform selective angiography and experienced in the administration of fibrinolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
