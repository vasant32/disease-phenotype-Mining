<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery imaged on plain CT scans has an attenuation value not higher than that of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the CT attenuation value of the vessel is higher than that of blood, basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is probably present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tentative diagnosis can be confirmed by comparison of the attenuation values on the pre- and postcontrast scans, preferably using multiple slices obtained by multiplane dynamic CT </plain></SENT>
