<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special attention is devoted to correlations as well as discrepancies between pathologic-anatomical findings, clinical findings and the results of additional diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting possibilities of erroneous diagnostic and prognostic interpretations are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The considerations lead to the conclusion that an attempt should be made to classify clinically the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> into oral, median and caudal types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present paper takes the pathologic-anatomical as well as the clinical findings into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been reported in recent years that in some instances patients have survived basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar observations suggested the advisability of investigating the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> among our patients with regard to pathogenetic, diagnostic and prognostic criteria </plain></SENT>
