<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for radiographic diagnosis of blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI), but use of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has increased dramatically in BCVI screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explores the utility, effectiveness, and cost of noninvasive CTA and MRA screening for BCVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 2,025 consecutive adults evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blunt neck trauma and BCVI were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BCVI, level(s) of cervical injury, involvement of foramina transversaria and internal carotid canals, presence of bony dislocation or subluxation, and subsequent treatment received were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients were analyzed based on fracture and injury patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cost effectiveness of CTA compared with DSA and the effects of CTA sensitivity and screening yield were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of reviewed patients, 196 received CTA or MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients (19.4%) were diagnosed with BCVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screening yield in patients symptomatic at presentation was 48.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large-vessel internal carotid, vertebral, anterior spinal, and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were associated with a positive screen, as were concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and spinal cord injury (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of patients with injuries found with noninvasive imaging, 50.0% of BCVI involved C1-3 fracture, 34.2% involved subluxation, and 65.8% involved foramina transversaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, CTA screening was more cost effective than DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Noninvasive imaging is a safe, accurate, and cost-effective tool for BCVI screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic presentation was the best predictor of BCVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant cost savings were realized using CTA rather than DSA, with similar effectiveness and patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic study, level III; economic analysis, level IV </plain></SENT>
