<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusion was documented by unenhanced computed tomography performed in the neonatal period demonstrating a "dense" artery at the tip of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of cerebral damage on MRI scan at 10 years of age confirmed the site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evidence suggests that embolization was the operating pathogenic mechanism of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> involving the carotid circulation has been well documented and may be due to many pathological factors including direct trauma to the carotid artery and embolization from remote sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the vertebral artery in the neonate is only rarely reported and only in association with significant cervical trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second child with a similar pattern of cerebral injury demonstrated on neuroimaging is described suggesting that this event may be more common than recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as seen in the adult are not apparent in the neonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the neuroimaging characteristics seen in this condition may help to provide the clinician with a reasonable pathogenetic explanation for unexplained cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
