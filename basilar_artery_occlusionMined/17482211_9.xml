<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is an infrequent but potentially fatal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both in adults and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with a 6-year-old child and we investigate the rationality for late treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the case of a 6-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> presented with a full blown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e>, admitted to the endovascular suite 44 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and we review <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the reported cases of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hours following admission the basilar artery was partially recanalized by intra-arterial thrombolysis combined with mechanical clot angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 h, the patient was awake, oriented, his speech function was fully restored and he had only a mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> that recovered completely after a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete clinical recovery after delayed (50 h) endovascular recanalization of basilar artery in a child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis combined with cerebral angioplasty, can successfully restore the patency of the basilar artery and the neurologic deficit of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, even after a considerable delay </plain></SENT>
