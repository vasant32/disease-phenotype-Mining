<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first patient this was due to a left pontine tegmental <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and a right-sided oculo-palato-facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> developed one month after the episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second one had a basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the basis pontis, dorso-lateral aspects of the left pons, and left cerebellar dentate nucleus, as well as the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A delayed left oculopalatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> was recognized 3 months later </plain></SENT>
