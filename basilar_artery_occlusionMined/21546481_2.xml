<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predictors of outcome before initiation of treatment are of special interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1992 to 2010, we treated 106 consecutive patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, treatment, clinical course, and 3-month and long-term outcomes (â‰¥12 months) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome parameters were vessel recanalization after treatment, complications, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, and mortality after 3 months and in the long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 months, clinical outcome was good (mRS score, 0-2) in 33.0% of the patients and moderate (mRS score, 3) in 11.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 40.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete recanalization was achieved in 69.8% of the patients, and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 3-month and long-term follow-up, 22 survivors (40.8%) showed clinical improvement of at least 1 point on the mRS score, 29 (53.7%) were functionally unchanged, and 3 (5.7%) showed functional worsening (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as a predictor of poor vessel recanalization (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was identified as a predictor of good or moderate clinical outcome (P&lt;0.0001) and survival (P=0.001) at 3 months, and younger age was identified as an additional predictor of survival (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For prediction of long-term clinical outcome, age was also an independent predictor (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series, intra-arterial thrombolysis as treatment of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at admission and age were identified as predictors of outcome, and these predictors should be considered for treatment allocation in future randomized trials </plain></SENT>
