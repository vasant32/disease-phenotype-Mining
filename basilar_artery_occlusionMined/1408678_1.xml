<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were five men and six women with a mean age of 70 years (range, 48-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of 11 patients had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and two had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to infusion ranged from 3.5 to 9 hours, and the total dosage of urokinase from 24 x 10(4) to 150 x 10(4) IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the occluded artery was achieved in nine patients (82%), and favorable clinical outcome was achieved in seven patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of whom were discharged with no neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction occurred in two patients without clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that intraarterial urokinase infusion therapy with superselective catheterization may be very useful in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
