<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 28 patients with vertebro-basilar or basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) have been recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in 7 of these 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients the diagnosis was angiographically proven and in 4 patients Doppler sonography and computerized tomography suggested this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BAEP and SEP findings were correlated to clinical and angiographical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAEPs could be classified into 6 different patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In more than half of the patients different BAEP patterns from the two ears could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A pathological IV/V complex was most often found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients and in patients with a basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> distal to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolonged interpeak latency of I-III was mainly found in alert or drowsy patients with caudal occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of a BAEP with only wave I preserved, or with no waves preserved, in patients with brain-stem functions suggests that BAEPs are not useful in the diagnosis of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SEPs were either absent bilaterally or else severely altered on one side in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In alert patients, including those with 'locked-in' syndrome, SEPs were never absent bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased N13-N20 interpeak latency was an uncommon finding in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the SEP and the angiographically proven location of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the 'locked-in' syndrome both SEP and BAEP findings were non-uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> SEPs were sometimes found in combination with severely altered BAEPs, suggesting partial deafferentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Since basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is now a treatable condition, early diagnosis and documentation of functional deficits moves into a more important clinical area than heretofore </plain></SENT>
