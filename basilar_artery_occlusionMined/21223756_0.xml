<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> cases were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and DSA (digital subtraction angiography) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient was found to have at least one cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantity relationship between collateral circulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> location was analyzed by SPSS 11.5 statistics software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, 46 <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> were found by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DSA demonstrated internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 24) and vertebral &amp; basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had at least one collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 23 cases of single collateral circulation, there were 8 cases of single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> locations and 15 cases of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> locations; among 23 cases of multiple collateral circulations, there were 18 cases of single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> locations and 5 cases of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Effective collateral circulation can be established spontaneously through multiple ways when cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> takes place if an intact Wills circle is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple collateral circulations may significantly decrease the quantity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> locations </plain></SENT>
