<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) with favorable prognosis and discussed the role of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 presented with minor brainstem dysfunction for 24 hours due to a short-segment embolic BAO at the mid-pontine level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiogram demonstrated reversed basilar flow through the posterior communicating artery distal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient suddenly went into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> due to spontaneous displacement and lodging of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to the top of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate recanalization was achieved by intra-arterial thrombolysis, and she recovered and was independent at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 developed progressive brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> due to thrombotic occlusion of the intracranial vertebral and the proximal basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies demonstrated that reversed basilar flow from the carotid system and meningeal anastomosis arising from the proximal vertebral artery filled the basilar artery distal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered after conservative treatment leaving only residual signs of lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent case series show varied prognosis of BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individual differences in the effectiveness of collateral circulation may be one of the reasons that accounts for this variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interval of reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> supported by the collaterals may widen the therapeutic time window up to recanalization following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
