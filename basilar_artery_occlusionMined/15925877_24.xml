<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to occlusion of the basilar or vertebral arteries may develop a rapid deterioration in neurological status leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and often to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While intra-arterial thrombolysis may be used in this context, no randomised controlled data exist to support its safety or efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomised controlled trial of intra-arterial urokinase within 24 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and angiographic evidence of posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were randomised, and there was some imbalance between groups, with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring in the treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good outcome was observed in 4 of 8 patients who received intra-arterial urokinase compared with 1 of 8 patients in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the need for a large-scale study to establish the efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
