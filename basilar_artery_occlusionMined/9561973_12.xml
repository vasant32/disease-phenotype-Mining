<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal therapy of vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of underlying basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, intra-arterial thrombolysis is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because this pathologic condition is rarely found and the procedure is time consuming and restricted to specialized centers, the question arises whether early intravenous thrombolysis could also effectively be applied in vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if early intravenous thrombolysis could be used effectively in vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A case series of 12 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> were followed up 3 months after thrombolytic treatment at the Department of Neurology of the University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany, a primary care and referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with clinically diagnosed moderate to severe vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with clearly determined symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> following a protocol similar to that of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, 7 patients exhibited moderate to severe brainstem symptoms without impairment of consciousness and 5 patients had impairment of consciousness, of whom 2 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 12 patients, 10 had a favorable outcome after 3 months defined as full independence (Barthel index score of 100) or return to premorbid condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a poor outcome with complete dependency due to reocclusion after primarily successful thrombolysis, and 1 patient died of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> and additional space occupying parietal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Favorable outcome could be achieved in the majority of 12 consecutive patients with moderate to severe vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
