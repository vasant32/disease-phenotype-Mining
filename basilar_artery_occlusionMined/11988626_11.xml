<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar occlusion remains a disease with a high mortality even after treatment by local intra-arterial fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive treatment with platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors such as abciximab may facilitate recanalization and improve the neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results after treatment of 3 patients by combined intravenous abciximab and local intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Treatment was performed within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed embolic occlusion of the basilar artery in 2 patients and atherothrombotic occlusion at the vertebrobasilar junction in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted of intravenous abciximab bolus administration (0.25 mg/kg) followed by 12-hour infusion therapy (0.125 microg/kg per minute) and local intra-arterial thrombolysis with tPA (10 mg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was only applied for catheter flushing (500 IU/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient with the atherothrombotic occlusion was treated with additional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization of the basilar artery occurred in 2 patients, whose conditions improved clinically to functional independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third patient only partial recanalization was seen, with only slight clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Besides a subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=1), no intracranial or extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor with local intra-arterial tPA might be a promising therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to define the clinical benefit and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate of this new pharmacological approach </plain></SENT>
