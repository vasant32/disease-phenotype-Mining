<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients with bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory infarction are presented whose initial diagnosis was basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo>; in one it was asymmetrical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both had their eyes open and did not respond to command except that after a delay they followed with their eyes a smoothly moving object; this was the only sign of awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a clear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertical gaze palsy</z:e> in the upward and downward direction unaccompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000615'>pupillary abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed fresh bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ACA infarction</z:e> in both patients; occlusion in the hind brain circulation was excluded by angiography in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, so <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> was the most likely cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bilateral ACA territory infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, even if accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertical gaze palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
