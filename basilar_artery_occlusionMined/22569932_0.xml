<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multimodal recanalization therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> provides high recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A substantial subset of treated patients survives with only minor or moderate functional handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, long-term functional outcome and quality of life in these patients have rarely been systematically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective study, we analyzed mortality, long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), and quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients who had been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in our institution between December 2002 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (57 male; median age, 65 years; range, 20-89 years) were treated by multimodal recanalization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This included intravenous thrombolysis (n=32) with consecutive on-demand intra-arterial therapy (n=23) or intra-arterial therapy alone (n=59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall recanalization rate was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median observation time of 4.2 years (range, 0.5-7.4 years), the mortality rate was 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 35 survivors, 26 patients (74%) had a good or moderate long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life was better than that of unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Backward stepwise logistic regression identified intravenous thrombolysis (P=0.002) and female sex (P=0.001) as predictors of favorable functional long-term outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> at admission (Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale ≤8) was associated with poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥4; P=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival is achieved in approximately 40% of patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with multimodal recanalization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Approximately 75% of the survivors have a favorable functional long-term outcome with an acceptable quality of life </plain></SENT>
