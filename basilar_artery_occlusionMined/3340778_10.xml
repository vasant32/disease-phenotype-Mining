<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had longitudinally oriented fractures; these were fatal in four patients due to either vertebral-basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, brain stem trauma, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six other patients had transversely oriented fractures that extended through the carotid canal and petrous temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While less frequently contributing directly to mortality, transverse fractures were also associated with cerebrospinal fluid leaks (two patients) and a cavernous sinus-carotid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were not as frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> or cranial nerve deficits as suggested in the current literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This retrospective evaluation reveals two distinct injury patterns that demonstrate a difference in related morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
