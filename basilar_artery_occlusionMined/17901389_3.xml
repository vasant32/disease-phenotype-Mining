<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Information about early recanalization of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after systemic tissue plasminogen activator remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the timing of recanalization in basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with systemic thrombolysis, microbubbles, and continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 20 patients with &lt;12 hours basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, 2 hours continuous ultrasound, and 3 boluses of microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler assessed recanalization at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to be independent if modified Rankin scale score was &lt;3 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 18.5 (interquartile range 16 to 26.5) and median time to treatment was 180 minutes (range, 80 to 720 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rate of complete recanalization raised progressively: at 1 hour 10%, at 2 hours 20%, at 6 hours 35%, and at 24 hours 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (50%), no recanalization was observed at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median discharge National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 14 (interquartile range 1 to 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Degree of National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale improvement was related to time of recanalization: median discharge National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale--1 for recanalization between 0 and 6 hours, 11 for recanalization between 6 and 24 hours, and 30 if no recanalization occurred (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, mortality was 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (10%) who recanalized within 24 hours died as compared with 60% of nonrecanalizers (P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rate of independent patients progressively decreased as time to recanalization increased (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, endovenous tissue plasminogen activator, microbubbles, and continuous ultrasound leads to early recanalization in a significant number of patients and this is associated with favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Immediate intravenous tissue plasminogen activator treatment should be the first therapeutic option in these patients </plain></SENT>
