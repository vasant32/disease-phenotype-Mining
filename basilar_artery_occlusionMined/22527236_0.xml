<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only limited data are available on functional outcome in elderly patients with BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using data from the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study, we aimed to determine outcomes in patients ≥75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measure was poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale score 4-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, insufficient vessel recanalization (defined as thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> score 0-1) and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SICH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four age-groups, based on quartiles: 18-54, 55-64, 65-74, and ≥75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared between patients ≥75 years and patients aged 18-54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and Poisson regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We included 619 patients [18-54 years n = 153 (25 %), 55-64 years n = 133 (21 %), 65-74 years n = 171 (28 %), and ≥75 years n = 162 (26 %)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients aged 18-54 years, patients ≥75 years were at increased risk of poor functional outcome [aRR 1.33 (1.14-1.55)] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> [aRR 2.47 (1.75-3.51)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, 35/162 (22 %, 95 % CI 15-28 %) of patients ≥75 years had good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between age groups were observed for recanalization rate and incidence of SICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although patients ≥75 years with BAO have an increased risk of poor outcome compared with younger patients, a substantial group of patients ≥75 years survives with a good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
