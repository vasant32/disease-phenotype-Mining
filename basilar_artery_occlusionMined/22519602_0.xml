<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the outcome of patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and treated with intravenous alteplase (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with tPA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between 1995 and 2010 were prospectively recorded in the Helsinki <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Thrombolysis Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>Hemiplegia</z:hpo> was defined as no visible voluntary movement on ipsilateral arm and leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients (n = 1579), we excluded those with BAO (n = 152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of remaining 1427 patients, 81 (6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 24 h, three had died and 20 retained their total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At day 7, a further nine had died, and 10 had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A good 3-month outcome, modified Rankin Scale (mRS, 0-2), was observed in 23%, independence in ambulatory function (mRS 3) in further 16%, while 9% were bedridden and 20% dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A wide clinical spectrum of neurological deficits coexisted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With advanced age, more neurological functions lost, and with early radiological signs, the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With combined fixed eye deviation (n = 23), half were either bedridden (n = 3) or dead (n = 9) by 3 months, and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage were common (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>Hemiplegia</z:hpo> at presentation should not prevent thrombolytic therapy by itself, as limb movements are likely to return, and two of five thrombolysis-treated patients will walk independently by 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With combined fixed eye deviation, the outcome is poorer and haemorrhagic complications are common </plain></SENT>
