<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients were referred to our hospital from 1995 until 2002 with variable clinical presentations and radiologic appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were subjected for tolerability to balloon BA occlusion test to verify the collateral supply from the posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated by intra-aneurysmal embolization together with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully isolated from the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient postoperative neurologic deficits were constant findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was finally good for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of complex BA trunk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by intra-aneurysmal embolization and BA occlusion method is a valuable alternative for management and successful isolation in patients with good collateral arterial flow </plain></SENT>
