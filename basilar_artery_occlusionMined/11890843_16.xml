<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential utility of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, including diffusion-weighted imaging, for the early management of patients with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Institute of Neuroradiology and Department of Neurology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In 4 patients with occlusion of the basilar artery, MRI was performed, including T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the short-term phase (&lt;12 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was obtained 10 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MRA was performed 3.5 to 11.5 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and showed basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DWI revealed different patterns of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, no or only small lesions could be identified; the remaining showed multiple and large lesions within the posterior circulation territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical status was severely impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (Rankin scale score, 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was initiated in 3 patients, leading to successful recanalization in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was favorable in the 2 patients with small DWI lesions and successful reperfusion (Rankin scale score, 2), whereas it was worse in those with large DWI lesions and persisting occlusion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar occlusion, the extent of DWI lesion involvement can be highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Small DWI lesions seem to be associated with a favorable outcome if reperfusion is achieved with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This could potentially be the case independent of time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
