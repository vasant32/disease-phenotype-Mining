<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe its application to the vertebrobasilar system (VBS) in ten volunteers and five patients with abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient with postsurgical stenosis of the brachiocephalic artery, reverse flow of the vertebral artery (VA) was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral blood flow from the anterior circulation over the posterior communicating arteries was shown in three patients with bilateral vertebral or proximal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to increase of pressure during contrast injection into the contralateral VA, DSA showed reverse flow of a dissected VA in one patient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The technique is little time consuming and is a promising add-on examination to conventional and MRA imaging of the VBS </plain></SENT>
