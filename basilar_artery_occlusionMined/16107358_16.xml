<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most data on the outcome of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are from recent case series of patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The limited knowledge on the outcome after a conventional treatment approach comes from a few small case series of highly selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide more data on the outcome of conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analysed on patients from three centres with symptomatic basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated conventionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional therapy was defined as treatment with antiplatelets, anticoagulation, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were available on 82 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case fatality was 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, 65% remained dependent (Rankin score 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 60 years (odds ratio = 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 9.5)) and those with a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 3.1 (1.0 to 9.6)) were more likely to have a good outcome (Rankin score 0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were less likely to have a good outcome (OR = 0.3 (0.08 to 1.2)) than patients with a maximum deficit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or fluctuating symptoms at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conventional treatment of symptomatic basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is associated with a poor outcome in almost 80% of patients, which emphasises the importance of the search for a more effective treatment approach </plain></SENT>
