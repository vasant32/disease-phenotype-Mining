<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most hospitals, thrombolysis is limited to intravenous (IV) route of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, without any therapeutic alternative in cases of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of cardioembolic AOBA, not responsive to a conventional regimen of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sequential combination of IV tenecteplase (0.4 mg/kg) led to a complete recanalization of basilar artery, with a very good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential for a combination of two successive IV regimens should be evaluated in AOBA </plain></SENT>
