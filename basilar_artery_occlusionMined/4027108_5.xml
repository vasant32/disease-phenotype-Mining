<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two patients, ligation of the basilar artery, and of a vertebral artery, was associated with deterioration in BAEP and resulted in postoperative brainstem dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the third patient, postoperative transient neurological dysfunction occurred following temporary occlusion of the basilar artery and this correlated with intra- and postoperative changes in BAEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAEP monitoring is recommended where temporary or permanent occlusion of the vertebrobasilar system is planned </plain></SENT>
