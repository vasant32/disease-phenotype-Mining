<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has a high mortality rate (85% to 95%) if untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a large single-center cohort treated mostly with intravenous alteplase and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cohort included 116 patients with angiography-verified basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied baseline characteristics, frequencies of recanalization and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (25.9%) had mRS 0 to 2, 42 patients (36.2%) had moderate outcome (mRS, 0-3), 26 patients (22.4%) required daily help (mRS, 4-5), and 48 patients (41.4%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (15.7%) developed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with post-treatment angiogram available (n=91), 59 patients (64.8%) had a complete or partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiological location of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was known in 55 of 91 instances, and recanalization was associated directly with clot location at the top-of-basilar (odds ratio, 4.8 [1.1-22]; P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent outcome (mRS 0-2) was associated with lower age and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, nil or minimal recanalization, and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> were independently associated with fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 71 patients (22.5%) who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> eventually reached moderate outcome, and additional 8 patients (11.3%) progressed to mRS 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas recanalization after intravenous thrombolysis strongly predicts survival and moderate outcome, therapeutic techniques should concentrate on clot location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although most adverse baseline variables, age, symptom severity, but also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> are beyond control, it should not preclude thrombolysis, which may permit independent survival </plain></SENT>
