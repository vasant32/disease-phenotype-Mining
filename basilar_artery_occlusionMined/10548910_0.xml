<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old man suddenly lost consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It took fifty minutes to arrive to our hospital after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, his consciousness was in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A head CT revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings but a cerebral angiography showed complete occlusion in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We gave 240,000 units t-PA intravenously for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intravenous t-PA dramatically improved his state of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the brain CT scan showed low-density areas in the left occipital area and right pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral angiography showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003991'>arterial sclerosis</z:mp> in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or hemorrhagic infarction in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hitherto reports showed the intravenous infusion of t-PA may be particular value in patients with thromboembolic occlusion in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our results support its efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the basilar artery territory </plain></SENT>
