<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Maintaining a steady thrombolysis service for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 24 h/7 days is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diurnal and seasonal variability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> affects the clinical outcome of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: We state that a 24 h/7 days availability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-trained physicians ameliorates weekend effects and other seasonal, weekday, or non-office-hour-related influences on outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with thrombolysis at the Helsinki University Central Hospital were prospectively registered (n = 1581) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 154) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Door-to-needle time, three-month clinical outcome as measured by the modified Rankin Scale dichotomized at 0 to 2 vs. 3 to 6, and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were analyzed with logistic regression models adjusting for baseline variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treating physician was defined as experienced after 18 decisions made to give thrombolysis treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Door-to-needle time or clinical outcome did not differ with regard to time of day or season of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher rates of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in spring (odds ratio 2·06, 95% confidence interval 1·03-4·11) and fall (odds ratio 2·08, 95% confidence interval 1·03-4·18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physician experience reduced the door-to-needle time (odds ratio 0·40, 95% confidence interval 0·32-0·50) but was not associated with patient outcome (modified Rankin scale 3 to 6, odds ratio 1·22, 95% confidence interval 0·95-1·59) or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0·80, 95% confidence interval 0·51-1·27) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy can be delivered at a steady service level at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With proper training, less-experienced physicians can provide high quality thrombolysis, but experience translates into faster treatment </plain></SENT>
