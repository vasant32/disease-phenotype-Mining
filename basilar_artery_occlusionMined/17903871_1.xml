<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Benefit has been reported in a relatively small number of nonrandomized case series beyond the six-hour time window in basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although intra-arterial thrombolysis appears to be an effective and relatively safe form of therapy for certain patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, better outcomes and fewer side effects than currently reported are to be desired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether this will be achieved in part by a better selection of patients based on physiologic rather than chronologic criteria, by achieving higher and faster recanalization rates (through combined use of intra-arterial and intravenous therapy or through use of mechanical clot-dissolution devices), or by combining thrombolysis with neuroprotectant strategies remains to be established by future trials </plain></SENT>
