<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This report describes two cases in a public university hospital in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present clinical and imaging findings from two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and severe BAOD, but without clinically relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> consisting of spells of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> that became progressively more frequent, up to twice a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological examination revealed slight right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and right homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pontine and occipital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography revealed severe basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other patient presented sudden left-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>hypoesthesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One year earlier, she had reported sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> that, at that time, was attributed to peripheral vestibulopathy and was not further investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a right-side pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both patients presented their symptoms while receiving aspirin, and became asymptomatic after treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnosing asymptomatic CAD as the cause of symptoms in BAOD can have disastrous consequences, such as unnecessary carotid endarterectomy and exposure to this surgical risk while failing to offer the best available treatment for BAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging features provided important clues for diagnosis in the cases presented </plain></SENT>
