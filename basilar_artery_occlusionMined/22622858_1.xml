<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effect of interventions aimed to reduce treatment delays in our single-center observational series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with IV alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) were prospectively registered in the Helsinki <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Thrombolysis Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of interventions to reduce treatment delays were implemented over the years 1998 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital delays were analyzed as annual median door-to-needle time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="920">DNT</z:chebi>) in minutes, with interquartile range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,860 patients were treated between June 1995 and June 2011, which included 174 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) treated mostly beyond 4.5 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the non-BAO patients, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="920">DNT</z:chebi> was reduced annually, from median 105 minutes (65-120) in 1998, to 60 minutes (48-80) in 2003, further on to 20 minutes (14-32) in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2011, we treated with tPA 31% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 94% were treated within 60 minutes from arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Performing angiography or perfusion imaging doubled the in-hospital delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or arriving very soon from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had longer delays because there was no time to prepare for their arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With multiple concurrent strategies it is possible to cut the median in-hospital delay to 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The key is to do as little as possible after the patient has arrived at the emergency room and as much as possible before that, while the patient is being transported </plain></SENT>
