<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery injury following cervical spine trauma can be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a C1 fracture resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> and neurological decline as a result of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with chemical and mechanical thrombolysis resulting in basilar artery patency and clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 43-year-old female who was involved in a motor vehicle collision where she sustained multiple cervical spine injuries including a comminuted fracture of the left lateral mass of C1 resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> which eventually led to a basilar artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 mg of intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator was infused throughout the clot, followed by mechanical clot embolectomy using an FDA-approved device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her neurological exam improved post-procedurally and she was discharged with a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> to a rehabilitation facility 3 weeks after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 15 month follow up, she is neurologically intact with the exception of some subtle difficulty with fine motor movement in the right upper extremity and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With this case, we report a rare and potentially devastating complication of C1 fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge there are only two previously reported cases where a C1 fracture has been associated with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this case, chemical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy resulted in recanalization of the basilar artery with excellent long-term neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
