<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> admitted to our hospital within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between April 2007 and December 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated parameters related to outcome, such as coexisting disease, clinical type, clinical severity at admission, the site of occlusion and the infarction lesion, the collateral flow from posterior communicating artery, therapy, and time to therapy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 28 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, good outcomes occurred in 6 patients (21%) and poor outcomes occurred in 22 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical severity on admission was significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 5 patients with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty achieved recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of 3 cases with recanalization resulted in poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical severity on admission was the determinant factor of functional prognosis in patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
