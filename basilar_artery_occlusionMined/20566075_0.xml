<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion were followed and the effectiveness of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) and subsequent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) with a balloon catheter were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the six patients with BA occlusion observed in this study, two had extended <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> on diffusion weighted image (DWI) and were treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other four patients received LIF at an average of 5.2 hours from occlusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of these four patients received additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with compliant balloon catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of the patients who received LIF achieved recanalization of the BA trunk and showed a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that LIF is beneficial for selected patients with BA occlusion and that successful recanalization is indicative of a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the poor prognosis associated with conservative therapy, we conclude that LIF should be attempted even for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients or in cases of prolonged occlusion time </plain></SENT>
