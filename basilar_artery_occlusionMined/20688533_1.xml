<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study retrospectively the prognostic factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with intraarterial thrombolysis and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within 3-48 hours of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 52 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with emergency intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) or urokinase (UK) or intraarterial thrombolysis combined with stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients simultaneously received stent placement for the partial recanalization of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of the patients were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 22 patients (42.3%), and 20 patients (38.5%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was 61.5% (32 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was achieved in 24 patients (46.2%), and partial recanalization was achieved in 16 patients (30.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of recanalization was 76.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores less than 14, treatment time window less than 24 hours, and a good recanalization were markedly correlated with good clinical prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores less than 14 and treatment time window less than 24 hours were significantly correlated with recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores less than 14 and good recanalization could act as independent predictors for clinical prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NIHSS scores less than 14 on admission and successful recanalization can predict favorable outcome for patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study shows that intraarterial thrombolysis and stent placement may be a useful treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
