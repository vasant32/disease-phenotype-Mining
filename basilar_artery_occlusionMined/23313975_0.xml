<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: A subset of basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is unsuitable for either primary microsurgical clipping or endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can performed through terminal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but only if collateral circulation is adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To circumvent these complications, a high flow VA-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> bypass may be performed to create an adequate collateral circulation, to allow the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and/or clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: The operative nuances of this approach are discussed in the case of a 47-year-old man with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> from a giant, unruptured basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with absent PCoA collaterals and incorporation of bilateral SCAs and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: The patient underwent a staged bypass from V3 to P2 coupled with terminal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The patient initially presented as mRS 2 with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptured following the first stage of the operation, and underwent a V3 to P2 bypass the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His post-procedural neurologic decline improved at 14 months follow-up to mRS 2, with substantial reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size observed at 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcomes for three other bypass cases for basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are also summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: We discuss the indications, preoperative diagnostic work-up, operative management and post-operative outcomes in managing challenging basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our experience, high flow bypass procedures combined with or without Hunterian ligation in the treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are well tolerated with good long-term results </plain></SENT>
