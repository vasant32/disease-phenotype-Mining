<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after STA-SCA bypass surgery is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 56 year old male and presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and speech disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative angiogram revealed severe stenosis of the basilar artery in its midportion between the bifurcation of AICA and that of SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the patient's clinical course was uneventful, but the angiogram showed that the previous stenotic segment of the basilar artery had been occluded and the distal portion of the basilar artery and its branches were perfused through the widely-patent STA-SCA bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 6 months after the operation, the patient developed a pontine infarction in the right paramedian region, which was confirmed on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiogram revealed that the occlusion of the basilar artery extended further proximally to a point just distal to the bifurcation of AICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So it was suspected that the perforating branches of the basilar artery to the pons were occluded with the extension of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic changes associated with the EC-IC bypass was thought to be responsible for the occlusion of the previous stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
