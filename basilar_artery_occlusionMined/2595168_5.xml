<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 60 year old woman, had a proximal occlusion which was revealed by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 63 year old man with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> who had a single episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated a lower basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third patient, a 60 year-old woman, had been operated from right carotid artery and left vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>; 8 years later, without clinical manifestations, a left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and an occlusion of the lower part of the basilar artery were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evolution was eventless after a left carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The last case was a 60 year old man who had a lower basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> associated with a left internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a full recovery after a hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From our personal cases and the review of the literature, long term survival after basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may occur in occlusions restricted to the lower or middle part of the basilar artery and with a good collateral supply from carotid and cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
