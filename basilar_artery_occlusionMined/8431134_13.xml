<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no large clinical series has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected nine consecutive patients with AICA territory infarction confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was the only cause and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with pure AICA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 4) were diabetic and likely had basilar branch occlusion due to basilar artery plaques that extended into the AICA or microatheroma that blocked the AICA origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients had no or had only recently had (1 day) prodromata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AICA plus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n = 5) had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the AICA and reconstitution of the distal basilar artery by collaterals through hemispheric anastomoses from the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients except one had prodromata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven of nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001291'>cranial nerve involvement</z:hpo> indicated a lateral pontine lesion in the territory supplied by the AICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients had the complete AICA syndrome, and none of the patients had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome was good in seven of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Isolated unilateral AICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> should be regarded as most likely due to small artery atherosclerotic disease in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More widespread infarctions that include that AICA territory are due to basilar artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
