<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of this EEG pattern remains poorly understood, although they have been attributed to lesion in the connections between the thalamus and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of top-of-the-basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with selective paramedian thalamic-mesencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in which triphasic waves were evident on the EEG during clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100786'>hypersomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triphasic waves with selective paramedian thalamomesencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that triphasic waves are a nonspecific manifestation of diencephalic dysfunction, probably of the paramedian thalamomesencephalic reticular system </plain></SENT>
