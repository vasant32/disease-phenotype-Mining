<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 45-year-old female was admitted to our department due to the abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain in her posterior neck and occipital head, and numbness in the right upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram showed the pearl and string sign from the left vertebral artery to the proximal basilar artery, and showed the basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but the basilar artery distal to the occlusion site was perfused sufficiently by the carotid via posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
