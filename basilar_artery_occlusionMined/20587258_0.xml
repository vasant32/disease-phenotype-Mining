<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because it requires only 2 cm-thick heavily T2-weighted coronal imaging with gray-scale reversal, we can obtain BPAS-MRI with any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> machine of any company </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BPAS-MRI can easily show the outer contour of the vertebrobasilar artery even if occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BPAS-MRI can also reveal the occluded basilar trunk and the shape of basilar top branching that we cannot see with any other imaging modality before the recanalizing interventional procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To avoid a dangerous blind manipulation of guidewires or micro-catheters, BPAS-MRI should be obtained prior to the interventional procedure in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
