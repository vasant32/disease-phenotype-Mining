<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intra-venous thrombolysis (IVT) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is the standard treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are many limitations to this treatment, such as the three-hour therapeutic time window and an age limit of 18 to 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We reported a 15-year-old boy with vertebrobasilar artery total occlusion that presented with a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of consciousness disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accompanying findings were clonic-<z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>jerky movements</z:mp> of the 4 limbs and startled gazing for 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consciousness soon returned, but left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007824'>total ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed basilar artery total occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emergency intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) with urokinase was performed 5.3 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The course was smooth and the patient recovered well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He was free of symptoms at clinical follow up 30 months after the IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest reported patient with complete basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to have received IAT and achieve a complete recovery in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our experience might suggest that IAT is an alternative treatment for patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> but exceeding the three-hour time window for IVT with r-tPA, even in adolescence </plain></SENT>
