<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with proven BAO in CT angiography, who had undergone NECT for initial evaluation (30 males, 11 females) were retrospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 41 age-matched patients without BAO were included as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NECT scans of both groups were assessed by three independent blinded readers (staff, fellow, and resident) in a randomized reading order using a standardized semiquantitative questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual BA hyperdensity, including the presence of HBA sign (hyperdensity scores of 4 and 5/5), was assessed, quantitative BA attenuation was measured in a region of interest (ROI), and diagnosis of BAO was made before and after ROI measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For statistical analysis, multivariate mixed effects models, likelihood ratio tests, and receiver operating characteristics techniques were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HBA sign had a relatively low sensitivity (60.98-65.85%), specificity (70.73-90.24%), and accuracy (65.85-75.61%) for the presence/absence of BAO on NECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optimal cut-off points were 40-42 HU (sensitivity, 68.29-78.05%; specificity, 75.61-82.93%; accuracy, 74.39-80.49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, quantitative measurement of BA attenuation can slightly improve the diagnostic predictiveness of NECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, even with optimal cut-off values, the sensitivity is too low to serve as the sole diagnostic decision-making tool </plain></SENT>
