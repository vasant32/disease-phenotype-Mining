<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We related intracranial auditory brain-stem evoked potentials (BAEPs) to the surface BAEP using a model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 17 baboons anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose, BAEPs were recorded bilaterally at the mastoids and in the caudal lateral lemniscus (LL) and inferior colliculus (IC), in response to monaural click stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrodes at these sites were each connected to the positive input of a differential amplifier, and one other electrode, placed at the vertex, was connected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the negative inputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of local cerebral blood flow (CBF) by hydrogen clearance were made at the LL and IC sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LL wave form contained 5-7 positive peaks, the second (B wave) being dominant and coinciding with the negative wave II of the surface BAEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following graded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, produced by basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, the latency changes of these two peaks were significantly correlated, as were those of the third wave (C wave) of the LL response and the surface wave III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the IC, the contralateral wave form contained 4 positive waves (A-D) and a later, dominant, slow negative wave; changes in its peak latency and those of the slow negative surface wave were similarly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The thresholds of local CBF for increases in latency of waves B and C in the LL were similar (12-15 ml/100 g/min), but in the IC the thresholds were 20, 30-35 and 20-24 ml/100 g/min for the B, C and slow negative waves, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that a gradient of sensitivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> is present along the brain-stem auditory pathways; this could explain the earlier change of the late, rather than early, BAEP components as reported in clinical cases involving brain-stem lesions </plain></SENT>
