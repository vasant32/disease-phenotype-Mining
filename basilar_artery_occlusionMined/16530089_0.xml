<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of TCDS for diagnosis and follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery (BA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in comparison/combination with spiral CT angiography (CTA) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 15 consecutive patients with clinically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion (BAO) by TCDS as well as 3 to 5 d later in those with proven BAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was verified in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BAO patients showed recanalization of the BA independent of thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TCDS appears to be an efficient method for BAO diagnosis when immediate angiography is not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together with CTA it increases diagnostic safety before performing an invasive and cost-intensive DSA </plain></SENT>
