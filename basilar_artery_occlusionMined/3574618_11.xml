<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 16 patients had 18 posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, including 2 patients with 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose from the rostral basilar artery, 2 arose from the midbasilar artery, 1 arose from the vertebrobasilar junction, and 1 arose from the proximal segment of the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were classified as giant (i.e., greater than 25 mm), and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were large (i.e., 15 to 25 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had BAEP and SEP monitoring, 4 had BAEP monitoring only, and 2 had SEP monitoring only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed significant abnormalities during operation, including 1 patient with transient changes in the BAEP when the lower pons and the 8th cranial nerve were retracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another patient had progressive increases in latency and decreases in amplitude and subsequent loss of the SEP cortical components during a period of intermittent temporary rostral basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wave P13 was also lost during that period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cortical components as well as Wave P13 returned after circulation was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BAEPs were unchanged in the same patient during the period of temporary basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had no significant abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no consistent changes during the various stages of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BAEP and SEP monitoring failed to identify ischemic events in 4 patients with neurological findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem ischemia</z:e> immediately after operation (i.e., 25% false-negative studies).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
