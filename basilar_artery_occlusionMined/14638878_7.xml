<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> usually causes severe disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until the recent developments in local intra-arterial or systemic intravenous fibrinolysis, interest in early diagnosis was low because there was no satisfactory treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus there is little information about the initial phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report on the early clinical features and patterns of evolution of severe symptomatic basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 patients with established basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (confirmed by angiography or at necropsy) were reviewed retrospectively, focusing on the early clinical aspects and time course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common initial symptoms were motor deficits (16/24, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsies</z:hpo>), articulatory speech difficulties (15/24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (13/24), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (10/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent objective initial findings were motor deficits (22/24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsies</z:hpo> (19/24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>eye movement abnormalities</z:hpo> (15/24), lower cranial nerve deficits (15/24), altered level of consciousness (12/24), and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>extensor plantar responses</z:hpo> (9/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of the disease was gradual in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in half the warning signs were present for up to two months before the final stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> and visual disturbances were early signs, while speech difficulties and motor deficits were late signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once permanent neurological deficits were present, the final illness was reached within six hours in 41%, between six and 24 hours in 32%, and in two to three days in 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients reviewed presented some symptoms and signs pointing to brain stem involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 8% (2/24) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> course with no adequate warning signs </plain></SENT>
