<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine clinical significance of PMD-TCD demonstration of reversed basilar flow in patients with basilar artery (BA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> using PMD-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a predefined set of TCD depth criteria and specific flow findings, occlusion was localized to the proximal, middle, or distal BA stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was used to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to assess outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BA occlusion was diagnosed in 16 patients (3 women, mean age 65, median NIHSS 8, mean time from symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 8.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PMD-TCD diagnosis of BA occlusion was confirmed in 11 of 12 patients who underwent invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversed BA flow on PMD-TCD was identified in 8 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed flow from carotid system in 6 of these 8 patients (kappa=0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with reversed BA flow showed lower NIHSS scores on admission (median 4 versus 15.5, P=0.009), on discharge (2 versus 21.5, P=0.03) and did not experience neurological deterioration during hospital stay (n=0 versus 4, P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward better outcome at 3 months (mRS 1 versus 4, P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detection of reversed flow in the distal BA with PMD-TCD is associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and better outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
