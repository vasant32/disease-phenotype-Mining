OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic vasculopathy of circle of Willis. Stroke is a common presentation. We describe clinical and radiological features of moyamoya disease in four patients. SETTING: Tertiary care center in a metropolitan city. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with moyamoya disease were identified by ICD-9 coding system of the hospital medical records. Demographic characteristics, clinical features/presentation, laboratory investigations and radiological investigations were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Four patients (three children and one adult) presented with hemiparesis. One patient expired during hospital stay. Two patients underwent surgery (synangiosis). EEGs of three patients showed focal abnormalities. Neuroimaging showed ischemic infarctions in all patients. Findings on four vessel digital substraction angiography and/or magnetic resonance angiography were compatible with moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: Moyamoya disease should be considered in all young patients, especially children, presenting with stroke.
