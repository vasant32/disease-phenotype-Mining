We report the case of a male with Buerger's disease and neurologic involvement. Cerebral arteriography showed multiple distal arterial obliterans with left-sided Moya-moya phenomena. Thromboangiitis obliterans is a chronic segmental occlusive disease affecting medium-sized and small arteries and veins throughout the body. Neurologic signs are rare, occurring in fewer than 2 % of cases, and most often found on the cortical surface and adjacent territories. We review the most common signs of this entity and its main diagnostic difficulties.
