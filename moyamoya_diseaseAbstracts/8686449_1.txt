The purpose of this study was to evaluate hemodynamic compromise in the patients with moyamoya disease and surgical modulation of the hemodynamics using stable xenon enhanced computed tomographic CBF measurement with the acetazolamide challenge. The study group consisted of 15 preoperative cases and 17 postoperative cases. In the preoperative group, regional resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebrovascular reserve capacity (rCRC) were reduced. The reduction was more prominent in the anterior circulation than in the posterior circulation. In the postoperative group, rCBF and rCRC were still low in the anterior circulation. Revascularization increased the resting CBF but did not change the CRC. Postoperative CBF did not increase in adults but increased in children. These findings suggest that the misery perfusion state may be present only in the child's brain. Measurement of CBF and CRC is useful to evaluate the hemodynamics of moyamoya disease.
