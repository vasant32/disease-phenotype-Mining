PURPOSE: The advent of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has enabled images with good spatial resolution to be obtained over a wide range in a short scanning time. Our purpose was to determine whether CT angiography using the MDCT system could effectively depict extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass routes. METHOD: Helical CT angiography was performed using an MDCT scanner in 12 patients who had undergone EC-IC bypass surgery: 10 patients had undergone superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis, 1 patient had undergone an encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis procedure for the treatment of moyamoya disease, and 1 patient had undergone an external carotid artery-MCA anastomosis using a graft. The resulting CT angiograms were visually evaluated for their depiction of the EC-IC bypass route. Conventional angiograms were available for comparison in all 12 patients. RESULTS: The EC-IC bypass was visualized to be patent at the site of anastomosis in all 12 patients. Branches of the MCA secondary or more to those connected to a donor artery were demonstrated in 9 patients, whereas MCA branches immediately distal to the anastomosis were demonstrated in 3 patients. The CT angiography findings corresponded well with the conventional angiography findings in all patients. CONCLUSION: Helical CT angiography using the MDCT technique is an effective method for visualizing EC-IC bypass routes.
