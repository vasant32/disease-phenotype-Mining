A 29 year old woman presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage. Angiographic findings were consistent with unilateral moyamoya. The patient was managed non-surgically and discharged with the indication of periodical followup angiography. Moyamoya is a rare entity that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events. At present, the natural history of unilateral moyamoya is not well established in relation to the progression to a bilateral form and to rebleeding risk. Periodical follow-up angiography (conventional or MRI) seems a reasonable management strategy.
