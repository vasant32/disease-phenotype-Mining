Moyamoya disease is a chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease of unknown etiology for which no effective treatment has been found. The authors report the result of 23 superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomoses and seven encephalomyosynangioses, performed on 13 cases with moyamoya disease and on four additional atypical cases. There were 10 children and seven adults in this study. The follow-up period ranged from 1 year and 4 months to 4 years and 1 month postoperatively; nine patients had excellent results, five good, and one fair; two patients were unchanged. The anastomotic procedure was most effective for transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurological deficits, and even minor or moderate neurological symptoms. The STA-MCA anastomosis appears to be an effective treatment for moyamoya disease.
