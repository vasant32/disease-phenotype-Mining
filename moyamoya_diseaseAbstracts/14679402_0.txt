Moyamoya disease is a progressive vascular disorder of unknown etiology. Theories of inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms have been proposed as the pathogeneses. We have designed a new method of administering N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) for experimental induction of moyamoya disease using an intravascular interventional technique combined with rod-shaped embolic materials made from lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer. The embolic materials containing MDP were repeatedly injected into the right internal carotid artery of monkeys in the embolic group. Intravenous injections of MDP solution alone were performed in the intravenous group. Histological examination of the arteries demonstrated reduplication and lamination of the internal elastic laminae, which corresponded with findings of moyamoya disease in both groups. These histological changes occurred not only in the intracranial arteries on the embolization side, but also in the contralateral intracranial and even extracranial arteries. The changes were more prominent in the intravenous group than in the embolic group. We conclude that the systemic humoral factors induced by MDP in this study may be important in the pathogeneses of moyamoya disease. Our observations suggest that moyamoya disease is a systemic vascular disease and has an etiologic factor affecting both intracranial and extracranial arteries
