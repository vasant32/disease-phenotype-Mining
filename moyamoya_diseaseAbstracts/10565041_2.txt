We had performed indirect revascularization surgery, mainly EMS, for cases with moyamoya disease, because EMS can revascularize a large area including the territory of anterior cerebral artery. However, in our initial cases, we found that three sides in two cases had post-operative ischemic complications. These cases suggested that intracranial hypertension due to pressure exerted by swelling caused by edema in the myoflap after EMS was one of the reasons for these infarctions. For the prevention of intracranial hypertension due to the edema in the myoflap, when we did EDAMS with dural pedicle insertion, we put into practice the new ideas about shaving the boneflaps to half of their original thickness, and prescribed 20% Mannitol after surgery. We tried these new ideas concerning treatment on four sides in three cases with moyamoya disease, and we were able to get good outcomes without any new neurological deficits.
