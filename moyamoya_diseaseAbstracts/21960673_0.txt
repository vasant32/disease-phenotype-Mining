A 10-year, retrospective review of the risk factors and clinical outcome of childhood ischemic stroke treated in a single tertiary care center was conducted. Sixty-two children were identified (33 boys and 29 girls), ages 1 month to 17 years. Risk factors included vasculopathy (35.5%), cardiac disease (17.4%), metabolic disorder (14.5%), infection (14.5%), and coagulopathy (1.6%). Nine patients (14.5%) had no identifiable cause of stroke and 1 patient had 2 risk factors. Hemiplegia (69.3%) and seizures (32.3%) were the most common presenting features, and seizures were significantly more frequent in children <12 months of age than in older children (71.4% vs 20.8%, P = .001). Recurrence of stroke occurred in 55.6% of patients with metabolic disorder, 33.3% of those with cardiac disease, and 19.0% of those with vasculopathy. Vasculopathy including moyamoya disease was the most important risk factor for ischemic stroke in Korea, and their prognosis were varied with the etiology of stroke.
