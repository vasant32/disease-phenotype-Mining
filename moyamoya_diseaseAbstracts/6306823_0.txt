A 19-year-old woman with migraine under contraceptive therapy had transient right hemiparesis due to a minor lesion in the left hemisphere, which was probably hemorrhagic rather than ischemic. On the left side, angiography showed nearly complete obstruction of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery, extending to the initial portion of its terminal branches, with an outlined "Moya-Moya" network. On the right side, moderate annular stenosis of the cervical portion of the internal carotid was visible. On subsequent angiographies, done 7 and 19 months later, blood flow was reestablished in the left internal carotid artery as well as in its terminal branches, but with persistent segmental stenosis. Since the stroke, the symptomatology of migrainous attacks has been altered, pointing to a left hemispheric spreading.
