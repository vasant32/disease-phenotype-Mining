The cerebral angiograms of 8 patients with childhood moyamoya disease showed that the common findings were stenosis/occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and the proximal segments of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and basal moyamoya. The volume of basal moyamoya and its collateral supply depended upon the stage of the disease. Leptomeningeal collaterals were frequent in the later stages. Stenotic lesions in the posterior circulation were seen in a majority (75%) of patients. A feature unique to the study was evidence of intracranial small-vessel disease and stenotic cervical internal carotid artery in half of the cases. The disease in the ethnic caucasian Indians seems largely similar to the classical disease frequently reported in the Japanese literature.
