We evaluated and analysed our own 31 cases of the haemorrhagic type of moyamoya disease to clarify the clinical features of this disease. The cases were divided into three groups. Group A consisted of 12 cases with aneurysms. Aneurysms on the circle of Willis were treated as ordinary saccular aneurysms. Group B consisted of 14 cases with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) without aneurysms. These were managed almost as spontaneous ICH. Group C consisted of 5 cases with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) without aneurysms or ICH. Twenty-two surgical procedures for aneurysms, ICH and IVH were done in 19 cases (62%). Nineteen procedures for preventing future strokes were undertaken in 11 cases (35%). The overall initial outcome was excellent in 12 cases (39%), good in 7 cases (23%), poor in 7 cases (23%), and death in 5 cases (15%). During the follow-up period (mean: 6.5 years), rebleeding occurred in two cases (8%), and ischaemic attacks in two cases (8%). The rate of rebleeding or ischaemic attacks was 1.19% per patient-year during the follow-up period. There was no ischaemic or rebleeding episode in cases treated by STA-MCA bypass with encephalomyosynagiosis (EMS) during the follow-up period. Management of the primary haemorrhage should be according to the clinical condition, type of haemorrhage, and source of haemorrhage. When the patient needs to undergo revascularization surgery to prevent future strokes, we recommend STA-MCA bypass with EMS instead of encephaloduro-arteriosynangiosis (EDAS).
