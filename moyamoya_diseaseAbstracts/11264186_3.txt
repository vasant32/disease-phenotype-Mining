An 11-year-old boy with hemoglobin sickle disease (HbSD), bilateral stenosis of the intracranial carotid arteries, and moyamoya syndrome had recurrent ischemic strokes with aphasia and right hemiparesis. His parents (Jehovah's Witnesses) refused blood transfusions. After bilateral extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery, hydroxyurea treatment increased hemoglobin F (HbF) levels to more than 30%. During a follow-up of 28 months, flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries remained stable, neurologic sequelae regressed, and ischemic events did not recur. This is the first report of successful hydroxyurea treatment after bypass surgery for intracranial cerebral artery obstruction with moyamoya syndrome in sickle cell disease. The patient's religious background contributed to an ethically challenging therapeutic task. (Blood. 2001;97:2165-2167)
