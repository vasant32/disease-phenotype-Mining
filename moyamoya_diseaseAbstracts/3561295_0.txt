A case of moyamoya disease in a young white adult is described. The patient presented at the age of 27 years with a cerebrovascular accident and over subsequent years has suffered several cerebrovascular accidents and, more recently, transient ischaemic attacks. Serial angiographic studies have demonstrated the development of the classical radiological findings of moyamoya disease. This case illustrates a rare cause of cerebrovascular disease in a non-Japanese individual.
