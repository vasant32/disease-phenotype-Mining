We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with disabling chorea due to moyamoya disease. His chorea seemed to improve with steroid therapy. We conclude that steroid therapy may ameliorate moyamoya-associated chorea, and perioperative steroids can confound neurosurgical outcome. We are unable to assess the effect of cerebrovascular bypass procedures on the outcome of chorea in this patient.
