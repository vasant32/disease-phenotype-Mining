 CONTEXT: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is the most prevalent autosomal dominant genetic disorder among humans. Moyamoya disease is a cerebral vasculopathy that is only rarely observed in association with NF-1, particularly in the pediatric age range. The present study reports an occurrence of this association in an infant. CASE REPORT: An eight-month-old female presented convulsive seizures with clonic movements. The patient suffered an ischemic stroke with hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed radiological findings compatible with moyamoya disease. The diagnosis of NF-1 was made at the age of 20 months. CONCLUSION: Despite the rarity of this association in childhood, children with focal neurological symptoms and a diagnosis of NF-1 deserve to be investigated for moyamoya syndrome.
