OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of pediatric cerebrovascular diseases. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical data for 204 pediatric patients under the age of 18 treated for cerebrovascular disease at Huashan Hospital within the past 13 years. RESULTS: Mean age was 12.7 years and male-to-female ratio was 1.91:1. Onset of symptoms was acute or subacute in 73.5% (150/204). Main clinical manifestations include: headaches (70.6%), vomiting (50.0%), loss of consciousness (22.5%), convulsions (21.6%), and focal neurological deficits (13.2%). The most common etiologies were: arteriovenous malformations (42.2%; 86/204), cavernomas (16.2%; 33/204), aneurysms (8.8%; 18/204), and Moyamoya disease (5.9%; 12/204). The cause remained unknown in 21% (43/204). CONCLUSIONS: As the main neurological medical center in the southern part of China, the statistics of Huashan Hospital could be representative. The epidemiology of pediatric cerebrovascular diseases has its own specificity. Pediatric cerebrovascular disease must be diagnosed in a timely manner and treated urgently, according to the distinct clinical features of the pediatric patient.
