A six years old boy, Japanese descendant, born in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, arrived to the hospital with sudden loss of muscular strength at the left side of the body. The cranial computerised tomography showed a right fronto-parietal ischemia and the digital angiography by caterism of femural artery, confirmed the diagnosis of brain obstructive chronic vascular disease(moyamoya). We have checked out in the literature that previous superior aerial ways infection, frequently precede the neurological manifestations. Such symptoms are in agreement with the mentioned case. This has suggested the hypothesis of inflammatory-immunologic origin of this disease.
