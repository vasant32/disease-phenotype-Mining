 OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether polymorphisms in eNOS are related to the age-specific onset of moyamoya disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three Korean patients [mean age, 23.0 ± 16.1 years; 59 female (63.4%) and 34 male (36.6%)] with moyamoya disease were consecutively recruited for this study. Three hundred twenty-eight healthy subjects [mean age, 27.7 ± 16.2 years; 217 female (66.2%), 111 male (33.8%)] were consecutively included in the control group. The subjects were divided into pediatric (< 20 years) and adult (≥ 20 years) groups. We further divided the moyamoya group into ischemic and hemorrhagic groups based on clinical and MRI findings. The frequencies and distributions of four eNOS polymorphisms (eNOS -922A>G, -786T>C, 4a4b, and 894G>T) were assessed in pediatric and adult patients with moyamoya disease and compared to the frequencies and distribution in the control group. RESULTS: No differences in eNOS polymorphisms were observed between control and moyamoya disease group. However, we found that the 4a4b sequences was less frequent in the adult group (p = 0.029). Compared to the control group, there were differences in the haplotype distribution of the study group, specifically the A-4b-G haplotype, which was seen more frequently in the adult patient group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pediatric and adult-onset moyamoya disease have different genetic backgrounds. These genetic differences can affect age-specific clinical characteristics, such as cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage.
