Three children with moyamoya disease are reported whose initial and predominant manifestations were choreic movements. Two of the patients presented with unsteady gait and the other with clumsiness. Choreic movements were recurrent and were often triggered by excitement, emotional tension, or crying. They occurred unilaterally or bilaterally and often alternated between the right and left. Moyamoya disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acquired chorea in children.
