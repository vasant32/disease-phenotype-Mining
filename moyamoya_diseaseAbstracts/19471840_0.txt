BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Moyamoya disease is an uncommon progressive cerebral vasculopathy, more frequently diagnosed among Asian individuals, but which has also been described in Brazil. Moyamoya patients may be submitted to different surgical procedures throughout their lives. Anesthesiologists must understand the pathophysiology of the disease and institute adequate perioperative measures to improve patients' prognosis. CASE REPORT: Female patient, 22 yr-old, chronic renal failure, with moyamoya disease, scheduled for surgical arterial-venous fistula installation. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol and atracurium and maintained with sevoflurane. Patient was maintained in normocapnia and normothermia throughout the procedure. Patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthetic care unit without complications. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the anaesthetic care of a moyamoya disease patient.
