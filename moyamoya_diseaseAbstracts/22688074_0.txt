A 31-year-old male presenting with intracranial hemorrhage manifesting as deep coma and anisocoria underwent immediate emergency surgery. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and perfusion CT immediately after the surgery suggested severe hypoperfusion in the right MCA territory. Postoperative angiography demonstrated right unilateral moyamoya disease. We predicted that brain edema and intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurring after the hemorrhage might result in cerebral infarction. Hyperosmotic drugs were contraindicated by dehydration. Therefore, therapeutic hypothermia was induced that controlled the ICP. We considered that the increased ICP, dehydration, vasospasm, and shrinkage of the ruptured vessel comprised the pathogenesis of acute cerebral ischemia after intracranial bleeding. Cerebral hemodynamics should be evaluated during the acute phase of cerebral hemorrhage to prevent subsequent cerebral infarction.
