Laser-Doppler (LD) flowmetry was used to measure tissue perfusion non-invasively and continuously during neurosurgical operations using an LD scanner. Scanning was usually completed in 20 seconds. Measurements were processed in software to provide a color-coded image of the tissue perfusion. Moreover, the measurement data, expressed in LD-units, could be used for statistical data analysis. No physical contact was necessary between the scanning device and the exposed brain tissue. The imager provided two-dimensional microvascular flow maps non-invasively and quantitatively during brain operations, and could show the CO2 reactivity in the vessels. LD scanning flowmetry is a promising intraoperative monitoring method for cerebral blood flow changes.
