The clinical, angiographic and computed tomographic features in eight children with Moyamoya disease were evaluated. The CT Scan findings were correlated with the angiographic features and the stage of the vascular disease. Stenosis/occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) and the proximal parts of the anterior (ACA) and middle cerebral arteries (MCA) were commonest angiographic findings. The cervical ICA was narrow in four patients. Infarcts (100%), abnormal enhancement patterns (63%) and cerebral atrophy (88%) were the frequent CT scan findings. Although the CT scan findings did not correlate entirely with the angiographic and clinical findings, they were more frequently abnormal in later stages of the disease. The volume of Moyamoya increased progressively up to stage 3 of the disease only to decrease with further progression. The etiology of Moyamoya disease in Indian children is not clear. However, the clinical and radiological features are similar to that in the Japanese.
