We analyzed the records of 44 patients with moyamoya disease evaluated and treated at our Institute from 1998 until 2007. Out of 44 patients, 18 (41%) were in the paediatric age group and 26 (59%) were adults. Presentation was ischemic in 14 (32%) and hemorrhagic in 30 patients (68%). Revascularization was performed in 11 patients (five patients with ischemic presentation and six with hemorrhagic presentation): nine patients underwent indirect revascularization procedures only and two patients underwent indirect revascularization procedures and a combined superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass. Thirty-six patients (81.8%) were available for follow-up. Out of 11 patients who underwent revascularization procedures, none had further hemorrhagic or ischemic episodes. Out of the 19 conservatively managed patients who were followed-up, seven (36.8%) developed new episodes of ischemia (n=2) or hemorrhage (n=5). In-hospital mortality was 6.8% (three patients), all of whom were in the hemorrhagic presentation group.
