Flow voids in the basal ganglia cannot always be recognized on magnetic resonance imaging, even in patients with typical moyamoya disease. In this report, flow voids in the basal ganglia and cisternal flow voids of the sylvian valley were evaluated in patients with moyamoya disease, and their diagnostic value was verified. A total of 41 consecutive patients with moyamoya disease were included in this analysis. The number of flow voids in the basal ganglia and the sylvian valley were counted on each side by 3 observers. Then the numbers of flow voids were compared between the patients with moyamoya disease and controls. The patients with moyamoya disease had a significantly higher mean number of flow voids in the basal ganglia and the sylvian valley (P < .0001); however, the number of flow voids in the basal ganglia was 0 or 1 in 69 sides (28.0%) in patients with moyamoya disease. Comparative analysis using the area under the receiver operating curve indicated that the evaluation of flow voids in the sylvian valley was significantly superior method to that in the basal ganglia (P < .0001). The cutoff value for the number of cisternal flow voids in the sylvian valley for the diagnosis of moyamoya disease was 6. Based on these findings, we recommend a definitive diagnosis of moyamoya disease should include assessment for abnormal vessels around the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries.
