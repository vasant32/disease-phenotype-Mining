Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique for depicting cerebral perfusion without contrast medium. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ASL can be used to detect hyperperfusion after revascularization for moyamoya disease as effectively as N-isopropyl-[123I]Î²-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fifteen consecutive patients with moyamoya disease were included in the study. All patients underwent surgical revascularization. Postoperatively, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL and (123)I-IMP SPECT during the acute stage, and rCBF of the operative side was compared with the other side. The asymmetry ratio (AR) was then calculated from the rCBF as measured using each modality. The postoperative AR of ASL was moderately correlated with that of (123)I-IMP SPECT (y = 0.180x + 0.819; R = 0.80; P = .0003). In this series, 2 patients (13.3%) suffered symptomatic hyperperfusion after revascularization and accordingly exhibited increased AR of ASL. Our data indicate that early increases in rCBF in patients with hyperperfusion could be detected using FAIR ASL supplemental to (123)I-IMP SPECT after revascularization. Our data indicate that FAIR ASL is a convenient method for evaluating hyperperfusion that can be performed repeatedly without the use of contrast medium or radioisotopes.
