 OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical experiences of treating intracranial aneurysms associated with Moyamoya disease by endovascular approach. METHODS: A total of 13 patients were admitted into our hospital because of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed the evidence of Moyamoya disease and intracranial aneurysms. Endovascular embolization was performed for these aneurysms with coils, balloon-assisted coils placement and stent plus coils. RESULTS: All operations were successful. Total occlusion was achieved in 11 patients and over 90% in 2. The patients recovered well with a patency of parent arteries. CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy is a valid and suitable approach for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms associated with Moyamoya disease.
