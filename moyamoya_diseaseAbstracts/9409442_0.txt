To examine the relationship between Moyamoya disease and bacterial infections, authors studied the serum of 85 cases of Moyamoya disease and the influence of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) infection on intracranial arteries in rats. The serum levels of P. acnes antibody, IgM, transferrin (Tf), alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) were significantly higher in Moyamoya disease than in normal volunteers. Moyamoya-like changes of the intracranial internal carotid arteries were histopathologically demonstrated in P. acnes infectious rats. These findings suggest that P. acnes and immunological factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease.
