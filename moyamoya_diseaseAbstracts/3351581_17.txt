Eleven cases of moyamoya disease refractory to indirect non-anastomotic revascularization, including encephalomyosynangiosis in two, encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis in seven, and encephalomyoarteriosynangiosis in two, are described. The patients suffered from recurrent cerebral ischemic symptoms, and further operative intervention, including superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and intracranial omental transplantation, was performed. The choice of operative maneuver depended on the availability of scalp arteries and on the nature of the ischemic symptoms. Although indirect non-anastomotic revascularization procedures have the advantage of technical ease and most patients respond to these procedures alone, there are some patients like the 11 presented here who are not cured by such procedures. In such cases, direct anastomotic revascularization is necessary for the prevention of stroke.
