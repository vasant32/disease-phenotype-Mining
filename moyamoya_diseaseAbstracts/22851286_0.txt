We analyzed the results of a multiphasic personal inventory test to confirm whether Moyamoya disease (MMD) affects the psychopathology in a group of young male Koreans. The authors manually reviewed the results of the Korean military multiphasic personal inventory (KMPI) for the examination of conscripts in Korea from July 2006 to May 2010. The normal volunteers group (N = 200) was composed of those males who do not have any brain disease or brain trauma. The MMD group (N = 37) was composed of those with MMD. There were more abnormal results in the MMD group (32.4 %) than in the normal volunteers group (13.0 %, p < 0.001). Results of the Neurosis Set showed that the anxiety scale, the depression scale and the somatization scale were more increased in the MMD group than that in the normal volunteer group (p = 0.014, 0.002 and 0.006, respectively). Results of the Social Relation Set showed that the aggregation scale was more increased in the MMD group than that in the normal volunteers group (p = 0.017). Young males with MMD may have more tendencies to have abnormal results of a multiphasic personal inventory test as compared to that of normal volunteers, suggesting that MMD may cause psychopathology in young Korean males.
