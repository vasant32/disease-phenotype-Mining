Two children with a new diagnosis of hemorrhagic type moyamoya disease experienced cerebral infarction after intraventricular hemorrhage. The patients developed ischemia 15 and 2 days after the initial diagnosis of hemorrhage. No provocative factor such as hypoperfusion was identified, but both patients exhibited signs of increased intracranial pressure on computed tomographic scan before infarction. Increased intracranial pressure in the setting of hemorrhage may be a risk factor for ischemic complications in patients with moyamoya disease. The optimal acute management of these patients requires further study.
