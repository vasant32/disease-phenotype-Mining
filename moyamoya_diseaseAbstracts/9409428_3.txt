Various surgical procedures have been tried for patients with Moyamoya disease. The most effective treatment, however, is still controversial. We retrospectively evaluated the long-term results of 71 patients (26 men and 45 women) with Moyamoya disease surgically treated in our institute. They consisted of 56 pediatric patients (younger than 15 years) and 15 adult patients. Symptoms in all patients were due to cerebral ischemia. We did 123 operations on 119 hemispheres: 18 superficial temporal artery--middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomoses, six STA-MCA anastomoses with indirect bypass (IB), 41 encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS), 29 encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) and 29 ribbon EDAMS. Average follow-up periods for each procedure were: 7 years for STA-MCA anastomosis, 6.2 years for STA-MCA anastomosis with indirect bypass, 11 years for EDAS, 5.6 years for EDAMS and 2.6 years for ribbon EDAMS, respectively. The results of each procedure were satisfactory because the preoperative transient ischemic attacks disappeared. Analysis of follow-up angiograms shows excellent filling of the ACA and MCA territory in the patients undergoing ribbon EDAMS. However, long-term follow-up study shows that about 10% of the patients had severe difficulty in social or school life because of intellectual impairment.
