Moyamoya disease is an occlusive intracranial arteriopathy owing to intimal hyperplasia with formation of abnormal cerebrovascular collateral networks; however, the etiology remains unclear. Although this disease is known to be associated with renovascular hypertension, it is extremely rare for it to be associated with stenoses of the coronary arteries. We herein described a case of a 56-year-old female with angina and asymptomatic moyamoya disease. We performed off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass and the risk of intraoperative hypotension. Conventional coronary artery bypass grafting has a potential risk of brain ischemia in moyamoya patients, but OPCAB may avoid this perioperative cerebral ischemic complication.
