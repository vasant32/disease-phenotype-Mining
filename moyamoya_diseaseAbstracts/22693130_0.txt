 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to compare lesion location between moyamoya disease-related intracerebral hemorrhage (MMD-ICH) and primary intracerebral hemorrhage (P-ICH). METHODS: Ninety-three patients each with MMD-ICH and P-ICH were compared. In patients with MMD-ICH, angiographic findings were assessed with special attention to the prominent anterior choroidal artery. Follow-up data were obtained through clinical visit and telephone interview. RESULTS: The location of hemorrhage was different between MMD-ICH and P-ICH, the most frequent one being intraventricular region (37.6%) in the former and putaminal region (46.2%) in the latter (P<0.001). Intraventricular hemorrhage was more frequent in MMD-ICH than P-ICH (80.6% versus 20.4%, P<0.001). In MMD-ICH, primary intraventricular hemorrhage was more closely associated with prominent ipsilateral anterior choroidal artery than ICHs without intraventricular hemorrhage (75.0% versus 16.7%, P<0.001). Higher rates of rebleeding and infarction were observed in MMD-ICH than in age- and sex-matched patients with P-ICH. CONCLUSIONS: MMD-ICH may differ from P-ICH in hemorrhage location, generally presenting with intraventricular hemorrhage with or without ICH, which may be due to a prominent anterior choroidal artery. Patients with MMD may be more likely to experience recurrent bleeding and infarction.
