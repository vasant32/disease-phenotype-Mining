The authors report four anesthetic experiences of a child with moyamoya disease for two occasions of angiography and bilateral encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS). For angiography anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of halothane-nitrous oxide-oxygen under spontaneous respiration. During the first angiography PaCO2 was 59.5mmHg and 55.2mmHg and it was 56.0mmHg during the second angiography. For EDAS, anesthesia was managed under controlled ventilation and avoiding hyperventilation. Blood pressure was stable. The patient awoke well. Under anesthetic management of a child with moyamoya disease who has normal cardiopulmonary function, the significant factor causing brain ischemia is hyperventilation.
