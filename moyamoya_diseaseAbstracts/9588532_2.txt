Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita is an uncommon, congenital cutaneous condition typified by persistent cutis marmorata and other associated abnormalities. Progressive neurologic complications are generally not a feature of the disorder. A case is reported of cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita associated with diffuse cerebrovascular infarcts at 7 months of age. Moyamoya-like vascular abnormalities were demonstrated in addition to the factor V Leiden mutation, a congenital hypercoagulable disorder. This novel case illustrates the importance of evaluating children with strokes for congenital thrombophilic disorders.
