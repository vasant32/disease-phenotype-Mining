We report clinical and angiographic features of accelerated intracranial occlusive disease resembling moyamoya vasculopathy in five young women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) and smoked cigarettes, but generally had no other obvious risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Three women had been on OCs for at least 4 years, one woman each had been on OCs for 3 months and for 2 weeks. All five women had smoked cigarettes for at least eight pack-years. Intermittent and progressive multifocal cognitive, visual, motor, or sensory hemispheric symptoms and signs developed in all. All patients developed strokes, four preceded by transient ischemic attacks. Cerebral angiography demonstrated bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery stenosis in four patients and proximal posterior cerebral artery stenosis in one. Additional features included rete mirabile, telangiectasias, prominent lenticulostriate collaterals, and multifocal distal cerebral branch occlusions. Three had mild abnormalities of serum fibrinogen, antinuclear antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or CSF IgG. After discontinuing OCs and reducing cigarette use, four women have not had further strokes over a mean follow-up of approximately 5 years. In certain young women, clinical and angiographic features resembling moyamoya may develop with the use of OCs and cigarettes. We speculate that an immunologically mediated vasculopathy may explain, in part, this unusual cerebrovascular syndrome in otherwise healthy young women.
