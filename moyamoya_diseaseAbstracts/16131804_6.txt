BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been acknowledged as a noninvasive diagnostic modality for moyamoya disease. However, in terms of staging of moyamoya disease, conventional angiography is still the gold standard. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish MRA grades for moyamoya disease as an alternative to conventional angiography. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (44 sides) with moyamoya disease diagnosed by conventional angiography were evaluated by MRA during the past 5 years. MRA scores were assigned based on the severity of occlusive changes of the internal carotid artery, the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery, the anterior and the posterior cerebral arteries and the signals of the distal branches of these arteries. Total points ranged from 0 (normal) to 10 (most severe). RESULTS: MRA scores (0-10) were significantly consistent with the conventional angiographic staging. Four grades based on this novel MRA scores correlated well with Suzuki's stages, with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: These novel MRA grades can be a reliable alternative to conventional staging. By employing these novel MRA grades, the use of conventional angiography can be avoided for the purpose of evaluation of the stages of moyamoya disease.
