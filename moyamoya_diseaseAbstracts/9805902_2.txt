A 61-year-old female presented with a unique case of moyamoya disease associated with pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was admitted for sudden onset of left temporalgia with episode of numbness on face, tongue, and upper extremity on the right side. The next morning, she had symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome and her ability to speak was disturbed. Her medical history included radical resection of lung cancer on the right side. She had no symptoms of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Neuroimaging showed an infarction in the left occipital lobe. Angiography showed occlusions of the bilateral internal carotid arteries at the supraclinoid portions. Subsequently, a left superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalo-myo-synangiosis was performed. Ninety-three days after admission, she suddenly developed dyspnea which resulted in death 3 hours later. Autopsy findings showed typical epithelioid granulomas of sarcoid type in the lymph nodes of the peribronchus, lung, and liver. Thrombotic emboli were found in the bilateral pulmonary arteries, and marked fibrous intimal thickening in the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Immunological reaction with inflammatory events may cause pathological changes in patients with moyamoya disease or sarcoidosis. The co-incidence in this case suggests that some common inflammatory events may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
