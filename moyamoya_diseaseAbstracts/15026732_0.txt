PURPOSE: A patient with moyamoya disease associated with a ruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm treated by endovascular embolization is presented. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old woman was admitted with severe headache to our hospital. Computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed evidence of moyamoya disease and a saccular aneurysm at the P1 segment of the left posterior cerebral artery. CONCLUSION: Endovascular embolization was performed using Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC), and the aneurysm was completely occluded with preservation of the parent artery. Endovascular treatment using GDC seems comparatively safe and effective for the treatment of cerebral saccular aneurysms in patients with moyamoya disease.
