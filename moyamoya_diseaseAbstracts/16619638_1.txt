The authors present the case of a 6-year-old girl with typical absence epilepsy induced by hyperventilation associated with moyamoya disease (MMD). A diffuse 3-Hz spike-and-wave complex induced by hyperventilation was apparent on an electroencephalogram, and her seizures were intractable to medication. Significant ischemia in the bilateral frontal lobes was present. The epilepsy disappeared after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalomyosynangiosis on both sides. In the treatment of children with intractable absence epilepsy, the possibility of underlying MMD and indications that revascularization surgery may be needed should be taken into consideration.
