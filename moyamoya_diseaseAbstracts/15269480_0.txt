Moyamoya disease, Japanese for 'puff of smoke', is a rare disease that presents most commonly with recurrent TIAs (transient ischemic attacks) / stroke in childhood. Ischemic symptoms in patients with moyamoya disease are usually due to hemodynamically-mediated perfusion failure. Identification of abnormal tissue perfusion is an important aspect of the evaluation of these patients. We present the radiological features including the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Perfusion findings illustrating the hemodynamic changes of cerebral ischemia in a case of moyamoya disease.
