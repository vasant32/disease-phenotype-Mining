A 10-year-old boy with congenital human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection developed recurrent episodes of left hemiparesis at age 7 years. The progression of his disease was followed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and cerebral angiography. The series of images showed progressive stenosis of both carotid arteries at the suprasellar origin with involvement of his anterior and middle cerebral arteries, while prominent collateral vessels developed from his external carotid supply through ophthalmic and middle meningeal arteries. The pattern of cerebrovascular disease is consistent with moyamoya syndrome. We suggest that further studies on the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease in patients with HIV could be helpful in understanding the cause of moyamoya disease as well. Also, with the various advances in treatment of HIV, neurovascular complications could be seen more frequently as the long-term survival in these patients improves.
