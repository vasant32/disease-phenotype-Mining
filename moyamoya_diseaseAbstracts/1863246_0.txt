Two cases of sickle cell disease with neurological complications are described. Cerebral angiograms were performed and a characteristic moyamoya-like angiographic pattern was demonstrated. This pattern results from a compensatory vascularization which may follow occlusion of the arteries at the base of the brain in several diseases. The risks of angiography and appropriate precautions are emphasized.
