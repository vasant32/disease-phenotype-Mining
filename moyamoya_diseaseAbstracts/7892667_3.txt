BACKGROUND: Omental transplantation is effective in the management of ischemia in the territories of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries in childhood moyamoya disease. We introduced a surgical revascularization using gracilis muscle transplantation to these territories. METHODS: Between January 1991 and May 1993, six children with moyamoya disease, between the age of 3 and 13 years, underwent gracilis muscle transplantation to the territory of either the anterior or the posterior cerebral artery. The mean period of follow-up after surgery was 15.2 months, with a range of 5 to 32 months. Three of the six patients had suffered from frequent transient visual disturbance and were treated with unilateral or bilateral gracilis muscle transplantation to the territory of the posterior cerebral artery. The other three patients had suffered from frequent transient paraparesis, mental retardation, and/or rectal and urinary incontinence, and were treated with gracilis muscle transplantation bilaterally to the territories of the anterior cerebral arteries. RESULTS: All three patients with gracilis muscle transplantation unilaterally or bilaterally to the occipital lobes manifested complete disappearance of their symptoms. Two of the three patients with gracilis muscle transplantation bilaterally to the frontal lobes also manifested complete disappearance of their symptoms. The remaining patient who underwent the transplantation bilaterally to the frontal lobes, continued to have episodes of transient paraparesis, postsurgically, but the frequency of symptoms was markedly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia in the territories of the anterior and/or posterior cerebral arteries could be overcome with the use of gracilis muscle transplantation in childhood moyamoya disease.
