A case of adult Moyamoya disease, with formation of a transcranial external carotid-internal carotid (EC-IC) anastomosis through burr holes which had been made previously. A 43-year-old male suffered sudden headache and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed mild consciousness disturbance and dysarthria. The computed tomography (CT) scans showed intraventricular hemorrhage, which was drained through burr holes bifrontally. The diagnosis of Moyamoya disease was subsequently made by cerebral angiography. A month later he was discharged with mild gait disturbance and mental retardation. Seven years later he suddenly complained of gait disturbance, dysarthria and sensory disturbance involving the right upper extremity. A CT scan revealed a small hemorrhage in the left putamen. Carotid angiograms disclosed transcranial EC-IC anastomosis through the burr holes which had been made previously. It is suggested that revascularization can be expected after opening burr holes and incising the dura matter for Moyamoya disease in adults as well as, possibly, in children.
