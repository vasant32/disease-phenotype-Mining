Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by steno-occlusive vasculopathy affecting the terminal internal carotid arteries. Although the effect of direct arterial bypass on the prevention of recurrent haemorrhage or ischemic events in patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease has been demonstrated, disappearance of aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease has rarely been reported. In this study, we present two patients with aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease. After superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis combined with encephaloduro myosynangiosis, the aneurysms on the moyamoya vessels disappeared, which was confirmed by follow-up angiography.
