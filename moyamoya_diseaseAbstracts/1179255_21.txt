Three cases (two children, one adult) presenting the angiographic features of the Moyamoya syndrome are reported, and the variety of the arterial collateral system is described. If there is a progressive neurological deterioration as a consequence of an inadequate collateral circulation, the creation of a new collateral vascular channel by way of anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and a branch of the middle cerebral artery is proposed.
