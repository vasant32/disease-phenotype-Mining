Adult identical twins with Moyamoya disease are reported. Laboratory examinations such as blood types, AB, Rh(+), HLA (human leucocytic antigen) analysis [AW26(9), A26(10), BW62(15), BW61(40), CW3], and finger prints, and hairs confirmed that two patients were identical twins. Both had normal serum immunoglobulin levels and no anti-DNA antibodies. Patient No. 1, a 39-year-old female, was admitted to our service with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting and left hemiparesis with sudden onset on Oct 31, 1981. The patient had an episode of tetraplegia that occurred suddenly at 4 years of her age and lasted about a week. Motor weakness had completely disappeared but moderate mental retardation remained. She had been employed just prior to this attack. CT and angiographic examinations revealed ventricular hemorrhage with Moyamoya disease, which had miliary aneurysm in the branch of the right posterior choroidal artery. The operation of encephalomyosynangiosis was performed on her left hemisphere. The postoperative course was uneventful. Patient No. 2, the twin sister of patient No. 1, was in good health and mental state until 19 years of her age, when she suddenly lost consciousness and developed hemiparesis. After this attack, her motor function had recovered well. However, mental ability gradually deteriorated and she was admitted to a psychiatric ward. CT examination and angiographic studies were performed on Oct 12, 1982, and she was diagnosed as having Moyamoya disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
