The author evaluated the diagnostic values of CT-Scanning on 20 cases of Moyamoya. No visualization of Moyamoya vessel was obtained, even after enhancement, but the author could differentiate 3 types of atrophic findings; normal pattern, cortical atrophic pattern, and wedged pattern. Futhormore, there was a considerable correlation between these findings and angiographic findings. CT-Scanning dose not have a diffinite diagnostic value in Moyamoya but is a very effective examination for the follow up study in Moyamoya.
