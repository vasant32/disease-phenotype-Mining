We reported a patient with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome associated with moyamoya syndrome. The patient was referred at 6 years 5 months with left hemiplegia and right-sided eye deviation. He had an apparently short stature, macrocephaly, left ptosis and atopic skin, and was odd looking. He exhibited an incomplete right bundle branch block on electrocardiogram and an atrial septal defect on ultrasound cardiography. He was diagnosed as having CFC syndrome. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed a flow void in the bilateral basal ganglia, but did not show any ischemic changes. Magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral stenosis with an internal carotid artery at the Willis artery ring level and bilateral moyamoya. Contrast angiography demonstrated occlusion of both middle cerebral arteries. Cerebrovascular anomalies have not previously been reported in CFC syndrome. This is the first case of CFC syndrome associated with moyamoya syndrome.
