A cerebral vasodilatory capacity map, consisting of a 99mTc-DTPA-HSA SPECT image obtained after acetazolamide injection minus the baseline image, was produced in a patient with moyamoya disease. The map demonstrated diminished capacity in the posterior region of the right cerebral hemisphere. Subsequently, cerebral infarction occurred in the corresponding area. This observation suggests that regions of low vasodilatory capacity identified by cerebral vasodilatory capacity mapping may be at high risk of ischemic stroke.
