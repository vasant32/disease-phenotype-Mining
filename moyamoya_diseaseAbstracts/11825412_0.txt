OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term results of 226 patients with moyamoya disease ased below 15 years and to report the modified method of extra-intracranial arterial anastomosis and encephalo-myo-arterio-syn-anastomosis, etc. METHOD: The mean follow-up period was 15.5 years (range 8 - 19 years). The results were obtained from the pre- and postoperative cerebral angiographic examination, MRI, CT, cerebrovascular Doppler ultrasonography, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), intelligence quotient (IQ) as classified by Taft and neurological symptoms. RESULT: Of the 226 patients with childhood moyamoya disease, 64 (28%) recovered in completely, 69 (31%) in improved markedly, and 46 (20%) improved slightly. 43 patients (19%) had no changes and 4 (2%) died. The effective rate of the operation was 79%. CONCLUSION: The modified direct anastomosis and encephalo-myo-arterio-synagiosis played a role in this improvement by increasing CBF after the operation. A significant correlation is found between the postoperative effect and the stages of preoperative angiograms.
