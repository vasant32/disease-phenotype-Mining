Eleven patients with moyamoya disease were studied with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed with a high-field-strength (1.5-T) superconducting magnet. In all cases a fundamental pathologic change of moyamoya disease--occlusion or stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and the proximal portion of anterior and middle cerebral arteries--was clearly demonstrated. The characteristic collateral network from the suprasellar cistern to the basal ganglia, which corresponds to the "moyamoya vessels" on angiograms, was seen in several patients. Various ischemic changes, including infarction, brain atrophy, and ventricular dilatation, were also well demonstrated. MR imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of moyamoya disease.
