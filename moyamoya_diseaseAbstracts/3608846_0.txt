Stroke before the age of 40 years is unusual and its etiology often different from that in older people. In a 29-year-old man the cause of a stroke was revealed to be bilateral vascular malformations at the base of the brain, an example of the moyamoya syndrome, rare among Europeans and published in German-speaking countries only in a few single case reports.
