A 10-year, retrospective review of the etiology, outcome, and complications of ischemic stroke in children from a nonurban population was conducted. Twenty-seven children were identified (14 boys, 13 girls), ages 1.25 to 17 years (mean 7.7 years). Etiologies included undetermined (22%), arterial dissection (19%), coagulopathy (15%), embolism (15%), moyamoya disease (11%), sickle cell disease (11%), isolated angiitis of the central nervous system or vasculitis (11%), or other known source (11%; two fibromuscular dysplasia, one L-asparaginase). More than one risk factor was present in five children. Seventeen (65%) children were anticoagulated, with no adverse events occurring. Nine children were anticoagulated initially with low-molecular-weight heparin. Other treatments included corticosteroids; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; and anticonvulsants for concomitant seizures. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 60 months (mean 17 months) and was as follows: 6 (22%) were normal, 9 (33%) had mild impairment, and 12 (44%) had moderate to severe deficits. There were no deaths. Neurologic complications included seizure (two), behavioral problems (two), and hemorrhagic conversion (one). In this population, the outcome from ischemic stroke was similar to that of other studies, with the majority of children demonstrating persistent neurologic deficits. Etiology could be determined for the majority of patients, with 19% having more than one risk factor.
