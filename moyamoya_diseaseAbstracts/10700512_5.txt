BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal artery lesions in moyamoya disease have been described sporadically in several case reports. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the angiographic findings of renal artery lesions in moyamoya disease and to determine the prevalence of renal artery lesions in patients with moyamoya disease. METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with idiopathic moyamoya disease were prospectively examined with both cerebral angiography and abdominal aortography. The findings of abdominal aortography were reviewed for the presence and appearance of renal artery lesions and compared with the clinical data and cerebral angiographic findings. RESULTS: Of 86 patients with idiopathic moyamoya disease, 7 patients (8%) were found to have renal artery lesions. Six patients (7%) had stenosis in the renal artery, and 1 patient (1%) had a small saccular aneurysm in the renal artery. Two patients (2%) with a marked renal artery stenosis presented with renovascular hypertension, which resulted in an intraventricular hemorrhage in 1 patient. Furthermore, the renal artery stenosis in the 2 patients with renovascular hypertension was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. There was no significant correlation between the presence of renal artery lesions and cerebral angiographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Seven (8%) of 86 patients with moyamoya disease showed renal artery lesions, including 6 stenoses (7%) and 1 aneurysm (1%). Renal artery lesions are a clinically relevant systemic manifestation in patients with moyamoya disease.
