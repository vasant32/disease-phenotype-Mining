PURPOSE: To point out the importance of both MRI and MR angiography for the diagnosis and follow-up of moyamoya disease. Materials and methods: We report seven cases. MRI was performed in the initial phase in three cases. MR angiography without conventional angiography led to the diagnosis in one case. Conventional angiography was performed in six cases. Follow-up MRI and MR angiography were obtained in two. RESULTS: The initial MRI revealed ischemic lesions in the sylvian territory in two cases, and a cerebral malformation in one, after-effect lesions in two, and cerebral atrophy and ventricular dilatation in one. Conventional angiography provided the diagnosis of moyamoya disease in all cases, associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformation in two. CONCLUSION: MRI and MRA should be performed for the diagnosis and follow-up of moyamoya disease.
