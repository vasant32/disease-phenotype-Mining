Homologous transfusion has been known to cause viral infections and other complications. Recently, autologous transfusion has been adopted widely as a safer and more effective procedure to prevent these complications. The authors report the experiences of 29 patients who had been operated on after preparation of autologous blood. Furthermore, the authors report a study concerning maximum surgical blood order schedule (MSBOS) of these operations. 212 patients operated on between January, 1991 and June, 1993 were used for this study of MSBOS. Although intraoperative transfusion was performed on 14 of 29 patients, the need for homologous transfusion was avoided in 12 of these 14 patients by the use of autologous blood. The frequency of homologous transfusion was reduced significantly after the introduction of pre-operative autologous blood collection in our clinic. The patients' value of hemoglobin fell after the collection of blood but these levels were not so seriously low as to impede the performance of operations. 212 cases of operated patients were divided according to the operative methods and diagnosis for calculation of MSBOS. The results were as follows; Craniotomy and removal of glioma 5u, meningioma 11u, neurinoma 7u, AVM 5u, transsphenoidal surgery 3u, Moyamoya disease 2u and V-P or S-P shunt 0u. Pre-operative autologous blood collection is easy to achieve for scheduled neurosurgical operations, and autologous transfusion is a beneficial procedure which should be used more widely.
