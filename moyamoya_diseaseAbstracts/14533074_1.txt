INTRODUCTION: The morning glory disc anomaly is a not very frequent congenital alteration of the optic papilla associated with a retinal vascular dysgenesia. Several cases of association have been described between this disc anomaly and the presence of Moyamoya vessels. We report the case of a boy with this association. CASE REPORT: A 5 year-old boy was evaluated for several episodes of disconnection, some of them preceded by intense headaches and associated to incoherent language, and in other occasions with hypotonia and unmotivated laugh of variable duration. The physical and neurological exploration was normal, except for the optic disc papilla of the right eye that was very big and dug, compatible with Morning glory disc anomaly. No alterations were found at cranial CT and EEG. In the magnetic resonance imaging were visualized multiple small round low intensity areas in the basal ganglia, because of the high number of collateral vessels. The angioRM showed stenosis of the supraclinoid portions of both internal carotids as well as the proximal segments of the anterior cerebral artery and the left middle cerebral artery with abnormal network of collateral vessels at the base of the brain like a puff of smoke . This is a typical imaging for Moyamoya disease. CONCLUSIONS: In all patient with Morning glory disc anomaly, mainly if they presents neurological clinical features, the realization of angioRM studies will be evaluated, to discard the existence of Moyamoya disease.
