We report an under recognized magnetic resonance postcontrast and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence finding characteristic of adult Moyamoya disease in a young woman who presented with new onset headache and a history of migraine. The imaging finding of the "ivy sign" is presented, along with a brief discussion of the pathophysiology of this radiologic presentation of adult Moyamoya disease.
