SUMMARY: Moyamoya is a cerebral vasculopathy of unknown etiology rarely described as a late effect after the treatment of childhood cancer. We describe a 12-year-old female who developed moyamoya after the completion of systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant interferon alpha for osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases. Given the importance of characterizing late effects after the treatment of childhood cancer, the potential role of interferon alpha in the development of moyamoya is discussed.
