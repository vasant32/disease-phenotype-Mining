The pathogenesis of moyamoya disease is still under investigation. In this study, the authors focus on the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease by using immunohistochemical analyses. The authors examined two specimens in the circle of Willis obtained at autopsy from two patients with moyamoya disease and two additional specimens obtained from control cadavers with atherosclerotic stenosis of the intracranial carotid arteries. Immunohistochemical examinations of the sections of the major intracranial arteries were performed using antismooth muscle cells (SMCs), monocytes, growth factor, cell nuclear antigen, and fragmented DNA antibodies. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) staining was present only in the endothelial cells of the moyamoya disease specimens and was not seen in control samples. In addition, the endothelial cells and SMCs in the media were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling of fragmented DNA method but not in the SMCs in the intima in moyamoya disease specimens, which indicates that an apoptotic process is active in only SMCs in the media but not in the intima. In conclusion, it is suggseted that the presence of bFGF in the media specifically seen in moyamoya disease suppresses the apoptotic process of SMCs in the intima.
