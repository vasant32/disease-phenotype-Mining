Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis is a safe and effective treatment for moyamoya disease, although recent evidence suggests its substantial risk for symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion. The diagnostic value of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for postoperative hyperperfusion in moyamoya patients is well established, but that of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/angiography is undetermined. A 22-year-old woman with hemorrhagic-onset moyamoya disease underwent STA-MCA anastomosis on the right hemisphere, but she suffered from transient left hemiparesis and facial paresis owing to cerebral hyperperfusion from 3 to 11 days after surgery as delineated by SPECT. The time-sequential 3-T MR angiography revealed intense high signal of donor STA and dilated branches of MCA around the site of the anastomosis. These findings were most prominent at 8 days after surgery, when her neurologic signs were most apparent. Intensive blood pressure control relieved her symptom and she was discharged without neurologic deficit. MR findings normalized 3 months later. The characteristic findings of 3-T MR angiography, which was not evident by 1.5-T MR angiography in the previous studies, may reflect intrinsic pathology of postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion. It could be a useful diagnostic tool after revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease.
