Summary: We examined newly developed three-dimensional angiography to understand the anatomy for surgery and for intravascular surgery in order to decide when treatment should be stopped. The subjects were 23 patients chosen randomly (angiography, 22). The diagnoses in these patients included aneurysm (5), arteriovenous malformation (6), meningioma, glioma, vascular tumours of the brain and the neck (5), and vascular diseases (6) including carotid artery stenosis, Moya-Moya disease, middle cerebral artery occlusion, and megadolico-ectasia (6). The new technique was used for intravascular surgery in six cases, which allowed the neck of the aneurysm and the bifurcation to be revealed. This method is useful for determining whether another coil should be inserted. In patients with basilar top aneurysm using this technique during coil embolization the intra-aneurysmal blood flow disappeared because complete embolization was performed. This technique was more useful during coil embolization, especially to decide the timing of withdrawal in intravascular surgery compared with conventional DSA.
