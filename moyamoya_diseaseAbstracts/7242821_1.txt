A case of Moyamoya disease associated with a basilar aneurysm was reported. The patient was a 49-year-old male who was attacked by subarachnoid hemorrhage in February 1980. Upon admission to our hospital, he was in good general condition and neurological examinations showed mild left hemiparesis and meningeal irritation signs. Four-vessel angiography showed bilateral stenosis and occlusion of the internal carotid arteries and abnormal vascular network in the cerebral base. Another conspicuous angiographic finding was a berry aneurysm associated with a daughter aneurysm at th basilar top. Enhancement CT scan revealed the basilar aneurysm and a well demarcated low density area in the right parietal lobe. It has generally been thought that the cause of symptoms in Moyamoya disease is rupture of vessels in the subarachnoid space on the cerebral cortex. However, in the case of Moyamoya disease associated with an aneurysm, rupture of the aneurysm should be considered to be a probable cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
