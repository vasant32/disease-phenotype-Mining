Three adult patients with moyamoya disease are described. They presented with intracerebral hematoma, cerebral infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage, respectively. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is rare in moyamoya and is usually the result of aneurysm rupture. No aneurysm was found in our patient. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the cerebral perfusion reserve assessed by the acetazolamide test, were significantly reduced in all three patients. The areas with most reduced baseline rCBF and most impaired vasoreactivity did not always correspond to the site of the vascular accident, indicating that these CBF changes were at least in part due to the moyamoya disease and/or its underlying causes, and not solely to the vascular accidents.
