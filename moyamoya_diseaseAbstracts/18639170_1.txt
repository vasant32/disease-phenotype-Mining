Direct surgical intervention to treat ruptured basilar tip aneurysms in patients with moyamoya disease has rarely been attempted, and patients who have undergone such treatment have not fully recovered. We review six cases of surgically treated ruptured basilar tip aneurysm associated with moyamoya disease, including our own case to illustrate aspects of surgical intervention and the difficulties encountered. Patients who underwent surgery after 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms showed impressive results. Of the patients who underwent surgery in the acute stage, two died, including our patient, and one showed excellent recovery. It is emphasized that to achieve satisfactory surgical outcome, the following factors should be considered: (i) delayed operation is preferable, with extracranial-intracranial bypass in selected patients; (ii) careful preservation of moyamoyas and transdural collaterals is mandatory; (iii) intraoperative rupture of the aneurysm should be avoided; and (iv) using a neuroanaesthetic technique of induced hypothermia and hypertension may be preferable.
