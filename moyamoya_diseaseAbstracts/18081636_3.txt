Anticonvulsants have been used for the treatment of impulsive aggression since the 1980s. A 50-year-old man suffered from irritability and agitation after developing a right ipsilateral frontal lobe infarction as a result of Moyamoya disease; these symptoms caused difficulties with his working and interpersonal relationships. The patient had been treated using multiple benzodiazepine agents for 2 years but his symptoms had not improved. However, after treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ; 200 mg) was begun, the patient's irritability and agitation gradually decreased. The efficacy of CBZ treatment in this patient suggests a method for controlling benzodiazepine-resistant impulsive aggression.
