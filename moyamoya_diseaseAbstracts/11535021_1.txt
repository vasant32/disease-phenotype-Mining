We describe a patient with moyamoya disease associated with an unruptured basilar tip aneurysm which was treated by endovascular embolization using Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs). A 53-year-old man presented with left hemiparesis persisting for 3 mon ths before admission. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries and the left anterior cerebral artery, stenosis of the right anterior cerebral artery, and basal moyamoya vessels. In addition, a saccular small aneurysm was seen at the top of the basilar artery. The aneurysm was completely embolized by intraaneurysmal GDCs. Direct surgical clipping is often selected for the treatment of posterior fossa aneurysms in moyamoya disease. However, complete clipping is usually difficult due to the difficulties in operative technique associated with moyamoya disease. We suggest that the endovascular treatment using GDCs is comparatively safe and effective for the treatment of surgically difficult aneurysms in patients with moyamoya disease.
