Stroke although rare in children, is an important cause of morbidity in the paediatric age group. Over a period of 8 years, 43 children (17 boys and 26 girls) in the age groups of 1-16 years (mean 8.02 yrs) presented with stroke which constituted 10% of all strokes in the young and 0.7% of all paediatric admissions. The chief clinical features were hemiplegia (86%), convulsions (27%), fever (23%), dysphasia (23%), headache (11%) and altered level of consciousness (11%). Routine laboratory tests were non-contributory. Cranial computerized tomography (CCT) on 21 patients was abnormal in 95% and was useful in revealing the extent of infarction. Infarction was confined to middle cerebral artery territory, often involving basal ganglionic structures and was associated with focal or diffuse atrophy. Angiograms were abnormal in 78% of the patients (18/23) and were complimentary to the CCT. Etiological factors identified were: Moya-moya disease 6, arteritis 5, fibromuscular dysplasia 2, scorpion sting 2, and venous sinus thrombosis and small vessel occlusion one each. Though 23% of the patients had fever at onset, no obvious evidence of systemic or CNS infection was noticed. Stroke in children continues to pose a diagnostic challenge.
