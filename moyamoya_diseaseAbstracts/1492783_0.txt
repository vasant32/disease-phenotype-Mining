We present a case of Moya-Moya syndrome in a 28-year-old female patient with an unusual debut in the form of mirror-image writing. The patient was studied by CAT, conventional cerebral angiography, MRI and angio-MRI. The results obtained show a very good correlation between the images of conventional angiography and those obtained by angio-MRI. Angio-MRI requires no contrast, is noninvasive and rapid, promising to be a first class alternative in the diagnosis and follow-up of Moya-Moya syndrome.
