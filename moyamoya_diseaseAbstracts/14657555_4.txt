BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare entity that results in progressive occlusion of the arteries of the circle of Willis, but the pathogenesis of MMD is unknown. METHODS: MMD sera (n=32) were tested for anti-endothelial cell antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassays and flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis was induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of MMD sera had anti-endothelial cell antibodies with apoptotic stimuli. Prominent reactivities of MMD sera (72%) with recombinant human alpha-fodrin were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that MMD sera contain a high incidence of anti-alpha-fodrin autoantibodies, providing new insight into the mechanisms of occlusion of MMD arteries.
