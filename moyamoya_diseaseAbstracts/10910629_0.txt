We report a patient with Noonan syndrome who had repeated transient ischemic attacks. Moyamoya was diagnosed from the image study. In addition, flunarizine therapy seems to be effective in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and signs. The association of Noonan syndrome and Moyamoya has been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case report of an association of the Noonan syndrome and Moyamoya. Further study should ensue.
