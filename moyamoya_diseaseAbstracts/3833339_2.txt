In many cases, intracranial occlusive strokes in children are treated symptomatically, with a diagnosis of acute infantile hemiplegia. This is because angiography is more difficult in children and, even if occlusive cerebral arterial disease is diagnosed, there is no definite therapeutic procedure. A case is reported of left internal carotid artery occlusion presenting with acute infantile hemiplegia and followed by repeated transient ischemic attacks. Encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis--developed as an operation for moyamoya disease--was performed on this patient, resulting in a marked revascularization of the brain in 8 postoperative months with good improvement in symptoms. This suggests that the operation may be effective in chronic cerebral ischemic diseases other than moyamoya disease.
