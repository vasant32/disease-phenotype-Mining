The objective is to clarify the early clinical characteristics in childhood moyamoya disease (MD). Epidemiologic characteristics, symptoms and diagnostic rates were assessed in 64 children (0-18years) with definite MD according to developmental stage: infancy (5; 0-1years); toddlerhood/preschool age (22; 2-5years); school age (29; 6-10years); and adolescence (8; 11-18years). The median ages at onset was 6.25years and the female to male ratio was 1.9 (⩾2.5 in toddlerhood/preschool age and in adolescence, P=0.71). Previous headache was observed in 23% (14/64): frequently in school age (38%, P=0.02) and within 6months before main symptoms (6/11). As an initial symptom, weakness was observed in 78% (50/64) mainly as transient ischemic attack (TIA, 61%) in limbs (90%) and unilaterally (82%). TIA was less frequent in infancy (40%, P=0.04). Seizure was observed in 27% (17/64): frequently in infancy (100%, P<0.01), as the focal type (71%), and in the right extremity (3:1). Isolated seizures without other symptoms was frequent in children ⩽5years (P<0.01). Severe headache associated with MD was observed in 14% (9/64). Provoking events were positive in 42% (27/64): in school age, frequently during eating (28%); and in toddlerhood/preschool age, during crying (27%). The diagnostic rates at 3 and 12months from symptom-onset were 39% (80% during infancy vs. 28% in school age, P=0.14) and 67%, respectively. Symptomatic progression at diagnosis was observed in 38% (24/64). Initial clinical characteristics in childhood definite MD differed according to developmental stage and from at diagnosis.
