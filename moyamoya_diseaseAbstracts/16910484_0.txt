A 28-year-old female patient with moyamoya disease after hemorrhage into the cerebral cavity, and a history of an indirect blood-circulation reconstruction surgery at 19 years of age, was scheduled to undergo cesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation because of pregnancy toxemia. No symptoms and no abnormal shadow with MRI were observed preoperatively. To avoid intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, epidural anesthesia was performed. No complication was observed during and after the cesarean section.
