 OBJECTIVE: Soft tissue reconstruction with a temporoparietal fascial flap (TPFF). INDICATIONS: Defect coverage with thin, pliable, and well-vascularized tissue. A bilayered TPFF provides a gliding surface in tendon reconstruction. Further options include TPFF harvest with overlying skin or subjacent bone for composite tissue reconstruction or the application as a sensate local fascial flap. Maximum defect dimensions: 17 × 14 cm. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Absolute: prior injury to the flap or flap pedicle, temporal arteritis, Moyamoya syndrome, defects with volume deficit.                         Relative: alopecia along the planned incision. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Pedicle location is outlined using Doppler ultrasound. Injection of the incision line with diluted epinephrine solution. Skin incision with subsequent visualization of the temporoparietal fascia and supplying vessels. Skin flaps are raised carefully paying special attention to the hair follicles (CAVE: postoperative alopecia). Primary closure of the donor site. Defect coverage with pedicled or free TPFF with subsequent full or split-thickness skin grafting. Dressing: Bolster or V.A.C. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Immobilization/elevation in the setting of extremity reconstruction. Removal of bolster dressing or V.A.C. on postoperative day 5. Dangling protocol instituted on postoperative day 7. Removal of sutures/staples at the donor site on postoperative day 5-7 and at the recipient site on postoperative day 12-14. RESULTS: The TPFF was utilized for soft tissue reconstruction in 8 patients. A pedicled TPFF was used in 2 patients. Mean time to healing was 16.3 days. Mean follow-up was 13.4 months. Successful reconstructive results with satisfactory functional and aesthetic appearance were obtained in all patients. Complications were encountered in 3 patients and included alopecia at the donor site and iatrogenic injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve. Vascular compromise was observed in the early postoperative period in a third patient. However, operative revision resulted in successful flap salvage.
