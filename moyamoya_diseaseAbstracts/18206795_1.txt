Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular condition characterized by steno-occlusive disease of the major intracranial arteries at the base of the brain, and the appearance of innumerable, tiny, arterial collaterals that resemble a "puff of smoke." Although it has been associated with hematologic diseases such as sickle-cell disease, the association with other hemoglobinopathies is less frequently observed. We describe the association of a unique hemoglobinopathy (hemoglobin Fairfax) with beta-thalassemia and moyamoya disease in a 9-year-old girl with a history of stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this unstable hemoglobin with moyamoya disease, and it emphasizes the potential for cerebral infarction due to the severe anemia of hemolytic disease.
