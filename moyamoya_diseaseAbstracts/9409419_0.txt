Dural arteries are potential donor arteries for cortical revascularization. In this report, a technique of indirect anastomosis using a split dura is presented. At surgery, the dura near the branches of the middle meningeal artery was split into outer and inner layers, and the split surface of the outer layer was attached to the cortical surface (split duro-encephalo-synangiosis; split DES). This procedure, combined with standard encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, was applied to 25 hemispheres in 18 patients with pediatric Moyamoya disease (mean age, 6 years). Postoperative superselective angiograms demonstrated effective cortical revascularization through the dural arteries in addition to the supply from the scalp arteries. All the patients were symptom free by 1.5 years after surgery. Postoperative reversible ischemic neurological deficit and infarction were seen in three (12%) and one (4%), respectively. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 12 years (mean, 6.5 years). Thirteen of 16 (81%) patients led normal lives and three were mildly handicapped due to mental retardation that existed preoperatively. The split DES is a useful technique to extend the area of revascularization of ischemic hemispheres in Moyamoya disease.
