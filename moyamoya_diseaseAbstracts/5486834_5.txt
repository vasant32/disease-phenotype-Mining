The case is reported of a 7-year-old Czech boy with an obliterating disorder of the large intracranial arteries with formation of an extensive collateral network of blood vessels of the `rete mirabile' type. It is analogous to cases described under the names `abnormal cerebrovascular network', `occlusion of the circle of Willis', or the `moyamoya disease' by Japanese authors.
