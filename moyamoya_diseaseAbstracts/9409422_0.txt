To improve cerebral hypoperfusion in the ischemic type of Moyamoya disease, we have applied superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) double anastomoses in combination with encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) for 19 hemispheres of 10 children (age from 5 to 11 years at surgery). Two branches of the STA were anastomosed to the two cortical arteries which were selected in the watershed area of the cerebral hemisphere estimated as a hypoperfusion area on the preoperative angiograms. Before surgery transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) developed from every month to every 6 months in association with hyperventilation or sobbing. No perioperative completed stroke or wound complications was observed, although single TIA developed in four patients within 1 month after surgery. Postoperative angiogram demonstrated that, not only the preoperative watershed area, but also the most of the middle cerebral artery territory was oppacified via the 2 branches of the STA in all 19 hemispheres. In a mean follow-up period of 4 years, no ischemic episode was induced by hyperventilation, and there was no mental or neurological deterioration. STA-MCA double anastomoses, to the cerebral watershed area, in combination with EMS are safe and effective even for younger children with Moyamoya disease.
