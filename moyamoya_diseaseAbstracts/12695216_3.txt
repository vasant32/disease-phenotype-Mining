A 9-year-old girl with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type 4 was admitted to the hospital because of choreatic movement. Cerebral angiography demonstrated bilateral symmetrical stenosis of the proximal cavernous segment of internal carotid artery, prethrombotic occlusion of the M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery, and moyamoya-like collateral vascular structure arising from the right lenticulostriate arteries. After a literature review, these findings were interpreted as vasculopathic changes secondary to vascular fragility caused by the collagen abnormality in OI.
