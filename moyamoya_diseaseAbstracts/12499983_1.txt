We report the case of a child with Moyamoya disease during a cerebral angiography procedure in which the effects of propofol on the cerebral perfusion were seen to be different compared with isoflurane. We suggest propofol was associated with a better preservation of cerebral circulation compared to isoflurane in this case of Moyamoya, as it maintained blood supply to the watershed areas.
