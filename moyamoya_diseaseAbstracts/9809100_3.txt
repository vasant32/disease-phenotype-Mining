We present the case of a parturient with moyamoya disease admitted to the hospital for elective cesarean section. Combined spinal and epidural technique was chosen because it allows better analgesia than epidural anesthesia and more hemodynamic stability than either general or spinal anesthesia. Ropivacaine was the local anesthetic of choice for the epidural portion because of the wide sensory-motor dissociation, thus preserving adequate respiration in the case of a high block.
