The efficacy of encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) using muscle free flap was evaluated for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in adult patients. Three patients with adult moyamoya disease and three patients with atherosclerotic ischemic cerebrovascular disease were treated. EMS used four latissimus dorsi muscles and two serratus anterior muscles. Postoperative selective angiography showed collateral circulation from the transferred muscle to the brain in four of the six patients. The other two patients showed patent nutrient artery of the transferred muscle flap. Cerebral blood flow study disclosed postoperative improvement of perfusion reserve capacity in all sides. One patient suffered a perioperative stroke by hemoconcentration due to poor control of diabetes mellitus. The mean follow-up period was 23 months. EMS using muscle free flap is a possible procedure in selected patients with impaired cerebral perfusion reserve capacity due to multiple stenosis or occlusion of cerebral arteries including moyamoya disease or who required cerebral blood flow augmentation in the anterior and/or posterior cerebral artery territories due to internal carotid artery occlusion.
