 INTRODUCTION: Despite Duplex ultrasonography being a noninvasive, easily repeatable, readily available and economical tool, this examination and its normal ranges are rarely described in Moyamoya disease (MMD). METHODS: Duplex ultrasonography examinations of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were performed preoperatively, postoperatively (within 30 days) and as follow-up exams (6 months postoperatively) after 32 cerebral revascularization procedures in 20 European patients with MMD. RESULTS: A significant higher mean diastolic flow of STA compared to preoperative values was found in postoperative (p<.000) and follow-up exams (p<.001) in Duplex ultrasonography. Postoperative and follow-up Duplex sonography of STA also showed a significantly higher mean systolic flow compared to preoperative values (p<.05 and p<.05). Also ECA showed significantly changes after bypass surgery (p<.05). CONCLUSION: Duplex ultrasonography of STA is a reliable and non-invasive tool to investigate hemodynamic changes after bypass surgery and to detect bypass patency in European patients with MMD.
