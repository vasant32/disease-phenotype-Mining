Three patients with moyamoya disease who had undergone bypass surgery at which bilateral encephaloduro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) anastomoses were created were studied with three-dimensional spiral CT angiography (3D-CTA). In one patient, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) clearly visualized the bilateral EDAS, and 3D-CTA also visualized these anastomoses in detail with extreme clarity. In the other two patients, MRA did not clearly demonstrate the right EDAS anastomosis, but 3D-CTA visualized both side surgical collaterals clearly. External carotid angiography confirmed these findings. 3D-CTA might have great value in the evaluation of surgical bypass patency and, in following the disease progression.
