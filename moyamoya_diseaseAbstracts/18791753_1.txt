In order to identify patients who suffer from hemodynamic cerebral insufficiency and can benefit from cerebral revascularization procedures, xenon-CT scanning has been established to reliably measure the critical cerebrovascular reserve capacity. As a need for alternative quantification methods arises, this study aims to characterize the significance of both time-to-peak (TTP) and mean transit time (MTT) in perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in this particular subset of patients. Ten patients in routine preoperative work-up for cerebral revascularization were prospectively enrolled and underwent both XeCT scanning and PWI. Cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) was calculated for each region of interest (ROI, n = 504) after administration of a vasoactive stimulus. ROIs were anatomically matched with those of PWI after TTP and MTT were calculated. Highly significant negative correlation was found for TTP and CVRC for all ROIs (r = -0.3954, p < 0.0001; symptomatic ROIs: r = -0.4867, p < 0.0001). Correlation was weak for MTT and CVCR (r = -0.1287; p < 0.01). The optimum threshold for TTP to detect impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in our patient group was 4 s (specificity 90.8%, sensitivity 44.4%) for all ROIs (TTP > 4.4 s for symptomatic ROIs, specificity 88.4%, sensitivity 62.7%). An approximative equation to calculate the probability of pathological findings could be derived from the data. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.76 (symptomatic 0.78) with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.71 (symptomatic 0.78). While PWI currently is not able to replace XeCT in the direct quantification of CVRC, it may serve as a readily available follow-up tool. A TTP threshold of greater than 4 s allows to confirm a cerebrovascular compromise in a selected high-risk subgroup of patients.
