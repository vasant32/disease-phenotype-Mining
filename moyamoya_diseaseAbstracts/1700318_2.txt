To evaluate the efficacy of vascular reconstructive surgery for childhood moyamoya disease, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 31 hemispheres of 16 patients was examined by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the 133Xe inhalation method. Results were divided into two groups; 17 hemispheres with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis [A(+) group] and 14 hemispheres without anastomosis [A(-) group]. The mean hemispheric CBF (mCBF) and regional CBF (rCBF) in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and basal ganglia regions were calculated. Pre- and postoperative SPECT on the 10 hemispheres of the A(+) group showed an increase in mCBF in 6 hemispheres, the disappearance of the low perfusion area (LPA) in all 5 hemispheres where LPA was present before surgery, and an improvement in rCBF distribution (an increase in rCBF in the frontal and temporal lobes and a decrease in the basal ganglia). This suggests that vascular reconstruction is greatly effective in treating this disease. A comparison between the A(+) group and the A(-) group by postoperative SPECT, as well as the clinical outcomes and the postoperative findings of electroencephalography and angiography, revealed that the A(+) group was superior to the A(-) group in the frequency of LPA (12% and 43%, respectively) and rCBF in the frontal region where STA-MCA anastomosis was usually performed. These results indicate that STA-MCA anastomosis with indirect synangiosis is the most effective treatment of childhood moyamoya disease.
