Congenital anomalies of the optic disc can be associated with intracranial vascular abnormalities. We report a 9-year old boy with morning glory disc anomaly in one eye and optic disc and infrapapilar choroidal coloboma in the other. His past medical history was remarkable for a transient ischemic attack. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the brain was consistent with moyamoya disease. This case illustrates the important association between optic disc abnormalities and moyamoya disease. Funduscopic examination of suspicious cases can be helpful in establishing the clinical diagnosis. Early identification of the intracranial vascular anomalies may be of help in preventing severe neurological complications.
