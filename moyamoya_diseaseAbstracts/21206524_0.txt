Background and Purpose: Moyamoya disease is a well described phenomenon. This pattern of collateralization associated with isolated middle cerebral artery stenosis and the natural history of this entity have not been well described. Methods: Cerebral angiograms and CT angiograms performed between August 2004 and August of 2006 demonstrating moyamoya collateralization were retrospectively reviewed. All cases of middle cerebral artery stenosis associated with a rete pattern of collateralization were included in this series. Demographic, clinical, and angiographic data were obtained. Results: There were three cases of middle cerebral artery stenosis associated with a moyamoya pattern of collateralization. The average age of the patients was 36-years old, 2 were male, and all were Caucasian. All patients presented with ischemic symptoms. The average degree of stenosis was 91%. No stenosis was seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries or elsewhere in the intracranial vasculature. Conclusion: We describe an unusual pattern of anastomosis associated with isolated severe middle cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion in Caucasians.
