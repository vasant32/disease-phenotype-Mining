31P-MRS and 31P-Chemical Shift Image(CSI) using volume coil were applied to Moyamoya disease of 14 cases, data of which were compared with clinical manifestations and neuroimagings. In four asymptomatic cases, signal intensity of both total P and total ATP was almost equal in each voxel, but in other cases, both signal intensity of the lesion was relatively decreased, compared with non-lesion. Especially, signal intensity of total P and total ATP in ischemic lesion was significantly decreased. This showed that 31P-CSI is able to demonstrate cerebral ischemic lesion not detected by CT and MRI. We have reported on Moyamoya disease that 31P-MRS comparatively correlates to cerebral blood flow and 31P-CSI demonstrates ischemic lesion as not detected by CT and MRI less invasively.
