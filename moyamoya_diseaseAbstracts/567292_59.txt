A 10-year review of the Mayo Clinic experience with childhood cerebrovascular disease unrelated to birth, intracranial infection, or trauma identified 69 patients (38 with ischemic stroke, and 31 with subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage). Although children with cerebral infarction had better survival, they experienced more residual disability than children with cerebral hemorrhage. The medical records-linkage system for Rochester, Minnesota residents made it possible for the first time to study cerebrovascular disease in a well-defined childhood population. Records from all medical facilities serving this population (average of 15,834 resident children) showed four strokes over 10 years (average annual incidence rate of 2.52 cases per 100,000 per year).
