Stenotic lesions of the cervical arteries due to atherosclerosis or irradiation may provoke the development of a Moya-Moya type collateral network. Rupture of a vessel participating in this collateral circulation may be the cause of a hemorrhagic accident. The hemorrhage may be subarachnoid, intracerebral or more usually intraventricular. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurred in a patient who had developed a Moya-Moya type collateral circulation secondary to atherosclerotic stenosis of a carotid artery. The hemorrhagic incident occurred during carotid endarterectomy, suggesting a predisposing role for hemodynamic modifications resulting from the operation.
