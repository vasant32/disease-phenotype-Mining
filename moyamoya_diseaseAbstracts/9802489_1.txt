BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To detect areas of cerebral perfusion from bypass arteries after vascular reconstruction, we administered selective intraarterial microsphere tracer into the external carotid arteries and determined (via single-photon emission computed tomography [IA-SPECT]) whether the distribution of radiotracer matched the arteriographic distribution of contrast material as shown on external carotid angiograms. METHODS: We compared the extent of regional distribution of tracer after external carotid artery injection of 20 to 40 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO or 99mTc-ECD with that of contrast medium on the external carotid angiograms in 582 cortical regions in 12 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease and in 18 patients with moyamoya disease. RESULTS: Marked accumulation of tracer was found only in the expected, specific, newly developed areas of cerebral perfusion from bypass arteries. The regional distribution of tracer corresponded to that of contrast medium in 523 regions (90%) and did not correspond in 59 regions (10%). Significant overestimation of the distribution of contrast material relative to that of tracer was observed in the patients with moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: SPECT showed slightly different distribution of tracer from that predicted by conventional angiography. IA-SPECT should enhance the analysis of newly developed areas of cerebral perfusion from the bypass arteries.
