A case of secretory meningioma with numerous meningothelial rosettes is reported. A 66-year-old man with moyamoya disease gradually developed skull deformity, and underwent surgery for the skull tumor overlying the hemisphere. Histological examination disclosed numerous meningothelial rosettes quite similar to those induced by subarachnoid injection of epinephrine and pseudopsammoma bodies described by Kepes. This may be the first case of meningioma associated with numerous rosette formations.
