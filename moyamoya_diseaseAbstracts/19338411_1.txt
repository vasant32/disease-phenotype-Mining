The authors report on the case of a girl with cerebrovascular moyamoya disease born with severe respiratory failure caused by a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Cardiopulmonary management included extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until the diaphragm defect was repaired. The right common carotid artery (CA) was interrupted and cannulated for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. When she was 5 years of age, the patient experienced ischemic symptoms in her right extremities. Angiography revealed stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal CA (ICA) with the development of moyamoya vessels on the left side of the brain; the right ICA was supplied by extracranial anastomotic arteries. Indirect extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery was performed in the left hemisphere, and the hypoperfusion improved. The same change in the intracranial ICA with the development of moyamoya vessels occurred on her right side when she was 7 years old. Decreased cerebral blood flow occurred twice, and the moyamoya vessels developed to compensate for the cerebral ischemia. However, the occlusion of the extracranial common CA in infancy induced extracranial anastomosis rather than moyamoya vessel proliferation, and collateral circulation was formed at the lesion site. This finding indicates that neoangiogenesis requires both cerebral ischemia and growth factors derived from the lesion.
