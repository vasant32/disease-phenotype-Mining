We describe a 14-month-old girl who presented with arterial ischemic stroke due to moyamoya disease, unilateral renal agenesis and external iliac artery stenosis. The association of moyamoya disease with renal agenesis and external iliac artery stenosis has not been described before. This report expands the spectrum of moyamoya disease and suggests that moyamoya disease may have an intrauterine onset.
