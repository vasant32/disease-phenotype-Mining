Pulse-inversion contrast harmonic imaging is a new ultrasonographic technique that can assess brain perfusion. In an adult with moyamoya disease and multiple recurrent strokes, this method detected subtle hemispheric differences in temporal-lobe perfusion, presumably due to neovascularisation, which were not shown by xenon-computed tomography or magnetic resonance perfusion imaging.
