Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive occlusive disease of the cerebral vasculature, mainly involving internal carotid and proximal cerebral arteries with development of fine collateral vascular network in brain. Coexistence of renal vascular lesion with cerebral vascular lesion has rarely described and association with external iliac and femoral vascular stenosis is not known to the best of our knowledge. This is the first case of renovascular hypertension with Moyamoya disease being reported in India with involvement of other extra cranial vessels.
