OBJECTIVE: To explore the roles of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease. METHODS: Serum G-CSF concentrations were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 20 children with moyamoya disease and 20 healthy children. RESULTS: Serum G-CSF concentration (35.7+/-10.3 pg/mL) in children with moyamoya disease was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (23.5+/-3.8 pg/mL) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The elevated serum G-CSF concentration in children with moyamoya disease suggests that G-CSF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.
