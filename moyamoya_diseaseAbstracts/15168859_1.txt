We performed SEREX (serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression library) to identify autoantibodies that are prevalent in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with moyamoya disease. These autoantibodies include PC326 (of unknown function), SRY (sex determining region Y), and peroxisomal D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase.
