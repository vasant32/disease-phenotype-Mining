OBJECT: Different revascularization procedures are used in the treatment of patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of direct and indirect revascularization procedures to the restoration of collateral blood supply in adult and pediatric patients with MMD. METHODS: The authors performed 39 combined cerebral revascularization procedures (standard extraintracranial bypass [STA-MCA bypass] plus encephalomyosynangiosis [EMS]) in 10 pediatric and 10 adult patients. All patients underwent physical examination and digital subtraction angiography before and 6 months after surgery. The STA-MCA bypass and EMS function were graded as Grade I (poor), II (moderate), or III (good) on the basis of the angiograms. RESULTS: In pediatric patients, bypass function was Grade I in 12, Grade II in 8, and Grade III in 0 hemispheres; EMS function was Grade I in 0, Grade II in 12, and Grade III in 8 hemispheres. In the adult patients, bypass function was Grade I in 8, Grade II in 8, and Grade III in 3 hemispheres; EMS function was Grade I in 10 hemispheres, Grade II in 5, and Grade III in 1 hemisphere. In the pediatric patients disease was classified as improved in 14 hemispheres on the basis of clinical results and stable in 6. In the adults it was classified as improved in 12 hemispheres stable in 7 hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: Combined revascularization led to good angiographic and clinical results in both patient populations. Especially in pediatric patients, EMS represents a suitable alternative to bypass surgery.
