Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebral vasculopathy characterised by progressive narrowing of the major intracranial vessels and development of collateral vessels. Clinically, it presents with cerebral ischaemic or haemorrhagic events, with eventual severe morbidity and mortality. A 10-year-old girl presented with episodic vascular headache and transient left sided hemiparesis, which persisted for a few hours and was clinically labelled as sporadic hemiplegic migraine according to International Headache Society criteria. We investigated all possible causes of unusual headache. Cerebral digital subtraction angiogram was carried out and moyamoya disease was finally diagnosed.
