BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of combined STA-MCA anastomosis and EDAGS using inverted STAGF and STAGP for the treatment of adult MMD. METHODS: This study included 8 patients with nonhemorrhagic MMD. There were 6 women and 2 men who were between 23 and 62 years old (mean = 37.8 years) in the sample. The combined surgery was performed on 12 sides in the 8 patients. The surgical results were assessed for clinical outcome, angiographic revascularization, and hemodynamic change on HMPAO brain SPECT. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 62 months (mean = 27 months). RESULTS: Clinical symptoms and signs were improved or stabilized, and the extent of revascularization evident on external carotid angiograms was excellent in all 8 patients. The CBF on HMPAO SPECT also improved in all 12 sides that were operated on with the combined surgery, except for the preexisting infarcted area, on the basal as well as Diamox stimulation studies. One patient had a transient speech disturbance after surgery, and another patient had delayed wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: The combined STA-MCA anastomosis and EDAGS using inverted STAGF/P seems to be one of the most effective surgical modalities for the treatment of nonhemorrhagic MMD in adults.
