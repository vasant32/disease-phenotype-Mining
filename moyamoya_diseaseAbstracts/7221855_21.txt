Intracranial transplantation of the omentum was performed on a patient with moyamoya disease who presented with diffuse cerebral ischemic symptoms and blindness. Anastomoses were made between the superficial temporal artery and the gastroepiploic artery of the transplanting omentum, and between the superficial temporal and gastroepiploic veins. Postoperative angiography demonstrated branches of the middle cerebral artery through the anastomosed gastroepiploic artery. Postoperatively the patient was able to walk with a cane without further ischemic attacks for the next two years. The blindness did not improve.
