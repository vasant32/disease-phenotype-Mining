Fluorescein angiography was performed in 12 hemispheres of eight young patients with moyamoya disease to study the epicerebral microcirculation. Regional circulation time and the time interval between carotid injection of the dye and first filling of the cortical arteries were various and prolonged in the most parts. There were nonfilling areas by carotid injection of the dye in six hemispheres. By venous injection, the dye appeared in all vessels of the exposed areas. Extravasation of the dye was seen in four hemispheres. The degree of these abnormalities of the epicerebral microcirculation was well correlated with the findings in conventional cerebral angiography.
