Moyamoya disease is infrequently associated with intracranial aneurysms arising from the circle of Willis vessels or from "peripheral" branches of choroidal and meningeal vessels. We present a rare case of a moyamoya-related aneurysm arising along the dural junction of multiple meningeal branches from the external carotid artery causing intracerebral hemorrhage. Endovascular coil embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and occipital artery (OA) led to delayed aneurysm obliteration without rehemorrhage.
