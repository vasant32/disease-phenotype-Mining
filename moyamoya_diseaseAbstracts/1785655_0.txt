We examined brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in 28 children with cerebrovascular diseases and 38 normal control subjects and investigated the neuroanatomic correlations of the late waves (VI and VII) of the BAEPs. The patients included 19 patients with moyamoya disease and 9 with other cerebrovascular accidents. Wave VI was more consistently seen (only missing in 2 cases, 5%-2 ears, 3%) than wave VII (missing in 26 cases, 68%-40 ears, 53%) in the control group. Absent, depressed or prolonged wave VI correlated well with cerebral lesions involving internal capsule and basal ganglia, while wave VII had a less significant correlation with any cerebral lesions in children with cerebrovascular diseases.
