Moyamoya disease is an uncommon clinical entity, characterized by bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery and the development of collateral arteries. An 18-year-old Saudi male with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with mild right hemiparesis, followed by recurrent ischemic stroke. Cerebral angiography showed bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with the development of collateral circulation (moyamoya vessels). There was no evidence of active SLE or other risk factors for cerebral occlusion, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Medical and surgical interventions did not influence the poor outcome of the recurrent ischemic insults.
