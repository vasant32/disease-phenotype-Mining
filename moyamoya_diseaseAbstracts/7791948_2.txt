Three siblings with moyamoya disease including identical twins are reported. Although the younger of identical twins had no neurological problems, CT and MRI detected cerebral infarctions and cerebral angiography showed the typical features of moyamoya disease. All three cases underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS), and serial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed that the distal portions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were well perfused through surgically created anastomoses. There were no findings of disease progression. MRA might play an important role in follow-up studies of moyamoya disease.
