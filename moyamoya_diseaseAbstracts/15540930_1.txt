The authors describe a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage from moyamoya-like vessels associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in a 44-year-old Hispanic man who presented with severe headache. The AVM was located in the left parietal lobe and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery was occluded. Although the patient was initially neurologically intact, he began to experience neurological deficits from mild vasospasm, illustrating the sensitivity of the underperfused portion of brain surrounding an AVM. His neurological deficits improved with aggressive hydration and elevated blood pressure. After a 3-week period, the AVM was resected without complication and all of the patient's neurological deficits resolved. The authors review radiographic findings of this unique case.
