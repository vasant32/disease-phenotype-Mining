Pathologic changes in superficial temporal arteries (STA) and middle meningeal arteries (MMA) biopsied from 15 patients with moyamoya disease (MD) who had undergone cerebro-temporal arterio-synangiosis were studied histologically, ultrastructurally and immunohistochemically. The main pathologic features were: proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and thickening of the intima, degeneration and destruction of SMCs in the media and intima, and the presence of condensed organelles in necrosed SMCs or the interstitium among SMCs, or both outside and within the elastica interna (EI). The EI had become thin, porous, fragmented and was even absent in some segments. These changes are different from those of other forms of angiopathy, but identical with those at the ends of internal carotid arteries (ICA) reported by us previously, being pathognomonic for MD. These changes in the STA and MMA reveal that MD involves not only the ICA but also the intra- and extracranial branches of external carotid arteries. The medial necrosis of SMCs seems to be the primary injury of the arterial wall in MD. STA tissue blocks from two cases of MD were stained immunohistochemically. By electron microscopy, IgG-, IgM-, and C3-positive granules were observed on the ER of endothelial and intimal cells. Further studies on more cases are needed to determine whether an immunoreaction has occurred in these arteries.
