BACKGROUND: Large bowel volvulus is extremely uncommon in children. The probable pathogenesis, predisposing factors and management of large bowel volvulus in children are debatable. METHODS: Seven consecutive cases of large bowel volvulus occurring over a 6-year period are reported. RESULTS: Two patients with caecal volvulus, one with transverse and subsequent sigmoid volvulus, one with transverse colon volvulus and three children with sigmoid volvulus are reported. Four girls and one boy with cerebral palsy, one female with Moya Moya disease and spastic paraplegia and an otherwise healthy boy presented at a mean age of 8.3 years (range: 3-15 years). The common presentation was abdominal distension (n = 6), tenderness (n = 6), constipation (n = 7) and bloody mucoid discharge per rectum (n = 6). Plain abdominal X-ray and barium enema were diagnostic. Resection with primary ileocolic, colocolic or colorectal anastomosis was performed in all cases. The mean follow-up was 3.4 years (range: 1-6 years) and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Large bowel volvulus in children may be due to congenital anomalous or absent ligamentous fixation of the large bowel, and abnormal mesocolon or a common ileocolo-mesentery. Large bowel obstruction due to volvulus must be considered in the differential diagnosis in a child presenting with constipation associated with bloody mucoid discharge per rectum. Resection of the involved segment and primary anastomosis is the definitive treatment for large bowel volvulus in children.
