From January 1992 to December 1997, 13 parturients with cerebrovascular diseases had childbirth at our institution. Among them, 8 patients received anesthesia for delivery. Five patients had a history of ruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM), cerebral aneurysm, or intraventricular bleeding due to moyamoya disease, and they had radical operations. Of these 5 patients after radical operations, three had a repeat cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, and two had a vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia to avoid excessive hypertension and hyperventilation. There were two patients with a history of cerebrovascular diseases but had no radical operations. Of these two, one patient who was diagnosed as having aneurysm underwent elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, and another patient with a history of cerebral bleeding underwent cesarean section under general anesthesia for abruptio placentae. These 7 patients did well during pregnancy and puerperium. The eighth patient experienced severe headache followed by loss of consciousness caused by ruptured AVM, and required an emergency operation. Simultaneous cesarean section and craniotomy were performed at another hospital. Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) occurred, but mother survived.
