The authors describe the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of moyamoya disease in a 51-year-old woman; the disease was confirmed by angiography. MRI demonstrated well the occlusions and collateral vessels that typically occur secondary to this rare disease. Although hemorrhagic complications often result in a poor prognosis for patients with moyamoya disease, the patient described here recovered.
