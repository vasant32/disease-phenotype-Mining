An unusual and first case of moyamoya disease of adult onset brain stem haemorrhage associated with occlusion of both vertebral arteries is reported. A 30-year-old man suddenly suffered from dyspnea, dysphagia, and left-sided hemisensory disturbance. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a fresh haematoma in the left medulla oblongata and various-sized old infarcts in both parietal lobes. Cerebral angiograms disclosed occlusion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries on both sides at their intracranial portion, accompanied with the developed basal moyamoya vessels. The right vertebral artery occluded at its V2-V3 segment, in which the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was opacified via the posterior spinal artery, and the basilar artery was filled from the anterior spinal artery. The left vertebral artery was also occluded at the craniovertebral junction (V4) with collateral flow. Only one case of moyamoya disease associated with bilateral occlusion of the vertebral artery has been reported previously, and a haemorrhage into the medulla oblongata in moyamoya disease has never been described.
