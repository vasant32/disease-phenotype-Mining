These reports describe mental recovery from childhood moyamoya disease wherein comprehensive and valid neuropsychological testing is administered in serial fashion. Two young children diagnosed with moyamoya disease underwent procedures to achieve bilateral revascularization. Neuropsychological studies were administered pre-operatively in one case and in serial fashion post-operatively through longer-term follow-up in both cases. Results indicated a trend of gradual improvements in both cases. The disease process and its postulated neuroanatomical and hemodynamic relationship to the psychometric findings are discussed.
