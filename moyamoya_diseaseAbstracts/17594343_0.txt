Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations in moyamoya disease are usually the result of cerebrovascular involvement of the visual pathways. We report a case of ischemic optic neuropathy due to ocular hypoperfusion as a result of moyamoya disease, despite a prior internal to external carotid artery bypass with normal hemisphere perfusion. The blood supply of the optic nerve, a proposed pathogenesis of an anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and complications of the ocular ischemic syndrome are discussed.
