A 28-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture of hyperthyroidism, goiter, ophthalmopathy, and an ensuing ischemic stroke. Cerebral angiography demonstrated moyamoya vessels around the Willis's circle and tubular stenosis of the bilateral extracranial internal carotid arteries. The combination of the above angiographic abnormalities occurring in a patient with Graves' disease is extremely rare. A pathogenic link between Graves' disease and certain specific vascular disorders is suspected.
