Moyamoya disease is a rare disorder in Taiwan. From 1984 to 1990, we documented 9 cases of Moyamoya disease, 5 from Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital, and 4 from Mackay Memorial Hospital. The average age was 34.2 years old, which is higher than compared with that mentioned in the foreign literature. In this series there were 3 cases with hemorrhages and 6 cases with infarctions. As revealed by CY scans, two of the infarction cases had low density zones involving splenium of the corpus callosum, which is an unusual location for cerebral infarction. Two of the hemorrhagic cases involved the ventricles, and another case, with putamen hemorrhage, ruptured into the adjacent sylvian fissure and the basal cisterns. The clinical data and radiological manifestations were analysed in detail.
