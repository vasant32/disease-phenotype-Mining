There have been no reports of extensive neuropsychological examination of patients with Moya Moya disease. Two previously reported cases examined with an intelligence test were severely incapacitated. The present case was found to have essentially normal performance on a wide range of neuropsychological tasks. The patient's primary deficits occurred on tests requiring rapid performance. This case illustrates that Moya Moya disease does not necessarily result in an incapacitated state.
