To evaluate the efficacy of direct cerebrovascular reconstruction to prevent intracranial bleeding from the point of view of haemodynamic status, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) studies in 5 adult patients with Moyamoya disease before and after superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in the MCA territories and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the striatum were measured before and after STA-MCA anastomosis. Correlation between the change of these PET parameters and post-operative decreased opacification of Moyamoya vessels were analyzed. Pre-operatively, significant elevation of rCBV were observed in the basal ganglia as well as significant reduction of rCBF and elevation of rOEF with reduction of rCMRO2 in the MCA territories, indicating "misery" perfusion in the cerebral hemisphere and blood pooling in the Moyamoya vessels under increased haemodynamic stress. Post-operative PET study showed improvement of misery perfusion and reduction of rCBV in the basal ganglia. Reduction of rCBV in the basal ganglia generally compatible with decreasing Moyamoya vessels on angiographic findings. Our results suggests that direct bypass surgery could have a potential both for decreasing haemodynamic stress on Moyamoya vessels and to improve misery perfusion in the hemisphere.
