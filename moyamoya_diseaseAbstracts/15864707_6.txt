CASE REPORT: We describe a 15-year-old girl with moyamoya disease whose initial manifestation was chorea-like involuntary movements. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal intensity lesions in the left frontal lobe, right parieto-occipital lobes, and frontal subcortical white matter. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed diffuse hypoperfusion of the whole brain. Bilateral direct and indirect cerebrovascular bypass surgeries were performed. Chorea disappeared 2 days after the surgery. Follow-up SPECT demonstrated increased cerebral perfusion in the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. CONCLUSIONS: Chorea accompanied with moyamoya disease can be properly managed by revascularization surgery. Moyamoya disease should be remembered as being one of the differential diagnoses of chorea, which is treatable by surgery.
