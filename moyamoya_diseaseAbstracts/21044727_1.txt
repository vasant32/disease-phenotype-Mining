A 60-year-old man with a history of recurrent strokes secondary to moyamoya disease underwent insertion of a percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy tube because of severe dysphagia. Feeding was continued for 5 months after the procedure without complications. Persistent diarrhea began 2 weeks after admission for comprehensive rehabilitation. Conservative treatment was not effective. Sigmoidoscopy showed a U-shaped tube suggestive of a gastrocolic fistula in the transverse colon. This was confirmed by means of a tubogram obtained through a gastrostomy tube. The diarrhea resolved after changing the gastrostomy tube. This case report highlights the importance of considering other uncommon conditions, such as a gastrocolic fistula, in the differential diagnosis of persistent diarrhea in a patient with a gastrostomy tube.
