Combined superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and encephalo-duro-arterio-galeo-synangiosis (EDAGS) were retrospectively compared with indirect bypass, EDAGS with or without inversion, in 134 hemispheres of 96 adult patients with non-hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD) in terms of angiographic findings, perioperative complications, and clinical outcome. Angiographic revascularization seemed to be better in the combined bypass group compared with the EDAGS group (p = 0.045), but perioperative complication tended to be slightly more common in the combined bypass group. No statistical differences were found in clinical outcome. EDAGS is a very reliable alternative to combined bypass in adult MMD. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the long-term efficacy of any bypass surgery in adult patients with MMD.
