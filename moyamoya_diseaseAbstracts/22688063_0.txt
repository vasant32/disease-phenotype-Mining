Many surgical treatments for moyamoya disease have been developed over the past 40 years. The optimum treatment for ischemic-type moyamoya disease is almost established. The first surgical treatment for the disease was the superficial temporal artery to middle carotid artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis. The discovery of spontaneous collateral formation following the STA-MCA anastomosis surgery led to the development of various indirect bypass procedures. Collateral formation and clinical outcomes from direct and indirect procedures have been compared to assess the merits and limitations of each technique. Experience and a greater understanding of the surgical effects of moyamoya disease have led to the development of surgical procedures combining various direct and indirect bypass techniques for optimal restoration of perfusion. This review of the historical development and efficacy of each procedure will aid surgeons in selecting the most appropriate surgical procedure for patients of different ages with different symptoms and disease severities.
