A retrospective survey of 38 cases of Moyamoya disease was done. The majority of patients were adults, and Chinese. There was a relative paucity of juveniles in our series which appear to differentiate it from Japanese results. The majority of adults presented with either subarachnoid haemorrhage or motor paresis. Associated aneurysms were noted in 3 cases. This study represents one of the largest series of this condition published outside Japan and appears to confirm the belief that this is not a condition peculiar to the Japanese and may occur more commonly outside Japan than is commonly believed.
