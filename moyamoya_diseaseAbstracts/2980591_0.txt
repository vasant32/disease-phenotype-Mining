A non-invasive technique using xenon-enhanced computed tomography (Xe-CT) for obtaining topographic regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) maps has been developed. During the past 3 years, the Xe-CT has been performed in 22 children with ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, including 17 cases with moyamoya disease. In moyamoya disease, rCBF maps revealed low flow in the bilateral frontal and temporal cortices, and high flow in the thalamus and putamen on both sides. Other diseases showed low perfused areas. Xe-CT can be easily performed even in infants and children and it gives valuable information that may be of clinical use.
