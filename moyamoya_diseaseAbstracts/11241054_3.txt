A 7-year-old boy with moyamoya disease developed sustained hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, hyperreninemia, and occlusion of the right renal artery. After right nephrectomy, hyperreninemia and hypertension improved. Proteinuria was resolved after nephrectomy, in parallel with the decrease in plasma renin activity. Moyamoya disease can cause nephrotic-range proteinuria, which is caused hemodynamically by hyperreninemia.
