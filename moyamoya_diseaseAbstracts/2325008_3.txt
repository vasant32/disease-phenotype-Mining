A case of Moya-Moya disease confirmed by cerebral angiography in a 10-year-old girl is reported. Hypertrophic collateral circulation is easily visualized by MRI. MR angiography very accurately demonstrated the vascular obstruction and the collateral circulation. As MR angiography is not invasive, it promises to become a valuable alternative to conventional angiography in the diagnosis of Moya-Moya.
