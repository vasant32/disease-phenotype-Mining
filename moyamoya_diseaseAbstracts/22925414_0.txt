Aneurysms of the lenticulostriate artery have been associated with hypertension, vasculopathy, tumors, and arteriovenous malformations. Although several cases of microsurgical treatment of ruptured lenticulostriate artery aneurysms have been reported, to our knowledge there is no published case of microsurgical treatment of an unruptured lenticulostriate artery aneurysm. We report a 66-year-old woman with a history of moyamoya disease, previously treated with a right-sided middle cerebral artery-to-superficial temporal artery bypass who presented with an unruptured aneurysm of a lenticulostriate artery. We report successful microsurgical treatment of this rare lesion and discuss the rationale for our treatment strategy.
