Moyamoya disease is present throughout the course of development, including juvenile development. Very careful EEG analysis may be a diagnostic method in such cases where clinical symptoms are not sufficient for diagnosis. Herein, we report a Polish case of moyamoya disease in a 13-year-old girl with polymorphic clinical symptoms. Even though her diagnosis was made late in the course of her disease, it was due to successful EEG analysis and not due to clinical symptoms that a diagnosis was made at all. Re-build up phenomenon was registered as well as an asymmetric slowing in background activity. High-voltage slow frontal and generalized activity was seen during hyperventilation.
