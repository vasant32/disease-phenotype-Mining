We describe a case with unilateral moyamoya disease that showed progressive hemichorea as an initial manifestation. Single photon emission computed tomography showed perfusion defect in the contralateral basal ganglia although magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. Hemichorea improved along with normalization of perfusion after bypass surgery, suggestive of striatal hypoperfusion as the cause of hemichorea.
