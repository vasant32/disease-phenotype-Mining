A 43-year-old man underwent minimally invasive mitral valve plasty of a flail mitral valve. Four years previously, he had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease (MMD) by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging/angiography findings. In MMD, risk factors for cerebral stroke include changes in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, blood pressure, and body temperature. And during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), these hemodynamic changes can be challenging. However, hypothermia during CPB can decrease cerebral oxygen consumption and have a cerebral protective effect. We performed a minimally invasive mitral valve plasty, using hypothermic CPB, in a patient with MMD, without any neurological deficits.
