Moyamoya syndrome is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by bilateral progressive supraclinoidal stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery and development of collateral vessels in the lenticulostriate region. The syndrome manifests itself in association with another disease or other clinical symptoms. We present the case of a 12-year-old girl with hemicentral retinal artery occlusion due to moyamoya syndrome associated with clinical and laboratory findings of presumed systemic lupus erythematosus.
