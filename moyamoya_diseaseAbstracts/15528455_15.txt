BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The etiology of moyamoya disease still remains unknown. This study was aimed to explore the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a strong inducer of angiogenesis, in development of moyamoya disease. METHODS: We studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 39 patients with moyamoya disease (24 children and 15 adults), 6 control patients with cervical spondylosis, and 7 control patients with internal carotid artery occlusion. CSF level of HGF was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. We also evaluated the distribution of HGF and its cellular receptor c-Met in the carotid fork obtained from 2 patients with moyamoya disease and 2 control patients. RESULTS: CSF level of HGF was 408.2+/-201.6 pg/mL and 443.2+/-193.5 pg/mL in patients with cervical spondylosis and internal carotid artery occlusion, respectively (mean+/-SD). On the other hand, CSF level of HGF was 820.3+/-319.0 pg/mL in patients with moyamoya disease, being significantly higher than those in 2 control groups (P<0.01). Both HGF and c-Met were widely distributed in the media and thickened intima of the carotid fork in patients with moyamoya disease but not in control patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that HGF is densely found in the carotid fork, and its CSF level is markedly elevated in moyamoya disease, suggesting that HGF may be a key protein for pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.
