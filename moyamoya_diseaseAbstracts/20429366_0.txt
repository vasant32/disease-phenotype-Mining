Aim of the study was to demonstrate the possibility of effective surgical revascularization of the brain in children with moya-moya disease. 3 year old girl with moya-moya disease underwent encephalo-duro-arteriosynangiosis. At 14 months follow-up signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia totally resolved. Angiography confirmed brain supply from external carotid artery via the newly formed anastomotic network. Authors emphasize the necessity to seek moyamoya disease in children with symptoms of brain ischemia to allow timely and effective surgical treatment.
