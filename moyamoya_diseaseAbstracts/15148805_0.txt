A case with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with moyamoya phenomenon is reported. The 44 year-old female patient was presented with headache and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed intraventricular hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed right frontal AVM and severe stenosis of right internal carotid artery. The AVM was fed by typical moyamoya vessels, Heubner's artery, and external carotid artery (ECA). We tried to embolize a bleeding point, compartment attached to lateral ventricle, but we could not. So, we embolized feeders from ECA and sent the patient to radiosurgery. We discuss here treatment and etiology of such rare condition.
