Two topics concerning the leptomeningeal vessels are discussed. The first portion indirectly proves that angiographic 'vault Moyamoya' consists of dilated preexisted vessels rather than newly-formed vessels, using morphometric analysis. The second portion presents a 67 year old autopsied case with Moyamoya disease who underwent encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS). Collateral vessels fomred by EMS are histopathologically identified.
