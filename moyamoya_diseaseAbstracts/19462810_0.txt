We described our management of a patient with moyamoya disease who presented for emergency cesarean section. A 29-year-old primigravida (162 cm, 61 kg) who had been diagnosed as having moyamoya disease at age 24, underwent urgent cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation. Because she was medicated with aspirin, general anesthesia was selected. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal and was maintained with sevoflurane in air oxygen mixture and fentanyl before delivery. After delivery, anesthesia was maintained with midazolam and fentanyl. Ventilation and depth of anesthesia were adjusted according to the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension and bispectral index, respectively. Hypertension caused by tracheal intubation was successfully prevented by nicardipine, which was ineffective for intraoperative hypertension. On the other hand, landiolol was effective for treating intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia. The cesarean delivery was uneventful and a healthy 2104 g neonate was delivered with Apgar score of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Landiolol was effective for treating intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia. Monitoring of depth of anesthesia, blood pressure, and ventilation would be essential for cesarean section under general anesthesia in patients with moyamoya disease.
