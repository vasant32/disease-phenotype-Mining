Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disease with a wide variety of clinical outcomes. The main signs of the disease are progressive occlusion of the main intracerebral arteries and development of a special network of collateral vessels, Symptomatology can be intermittent, with light neurologic symptoms, or the disease can progress step-wise, with eventual physical and mental deterioration. Several operative methods have been evolved to improve cerebral bloodflow in this disease. We describe three children with Moyamoya disease. Two of them were the first patients offered operation for their disease in Norway. The article describes diagnostic measures, possible pathogenic mechanisms, and treatment.
