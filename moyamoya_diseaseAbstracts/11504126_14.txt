OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The beneficial effects of surgical revascularization on rebleeding in moyamoya disease remain unclear. This report is intended to clarify the effects of surgical revascularization on peripheral artery aneurysms, which represent one of the causes of intracranial bleeding in moyamoya disease. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Findings for three female patients who experienced intracranial bleeding are presented. Cerebral angiography revealed that intracranial bleeding resulted from the rupture of peripheral artery aneurysms arising from dilated collateral vessels such as the lenticulostriate artery. INTERVENTION: The patients successfully underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis combined with encephaloduromyoarteriosynangiosis. Angiography demonstrated obliteration of the peripheral artery aneurysms, together with the disappearance or decrease in caliber of the parent collateral arteries, after surgery. None of the patients experienced rebleeding during the follow-up period (up to 52 mo). CONCLUSION: The results strongly suggest that surgical revascularization potentially improves cerebral circulation and decreases hemodynamic stress on collateral vessels, obliterating peripheral artery aneurysms.
