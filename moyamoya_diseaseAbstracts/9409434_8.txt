Intracranial hemorrhage is the major catastrophic event in the natural course of Moyamoya disease, and outcome of the patients with rebleeding is very poor. However, the mechanism underlying intracranial rebleeding is not well elucidated. We retrospectively analyzed 15 patients who bled two times or more among 46 bled patients with Moyamoya disease. The results indicated that there were two different types in the manner of rebleeding. One group consisted of seven cases, which bled two times or more at the same site than the original bleeding site. In four of these seven cases, a ruptured aneurysm was identified at the distal part of collateral vessel or on the major vessel. In the other three cases, no source of bleeding was identified. In all of these cases, rebleeding occurred within 2 months after the initial insult except for one case. Another group consisted of eight cases, which bled repeatedly but at different sites from the initial bleeding site. In any of these cases, neither aneurysms nor other vascular abnormalities were identified. In all of these cases, rebleeding occurred more than 2 months after the initial bleeding. The present result indicated that intracranial bleeding might occur as a result of rupture of a tiny aneurysm at the periphery of collateral vessels. These aneurysms may be blown out after initial bleeding. When they persist after the event, they may rupture again in a fairly short interval. In other cases, bleeding occur at different sites from the initial site. They are considered to be a result of ruptured weak Moyamoya vessels which are forced to act as collateral pathways and are under unusually increased hemodynamic stress.
