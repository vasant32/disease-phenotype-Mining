Moyamoya disease is a chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid artery often accompanied by stenosis of the anterior and/or middle cerebral arteries. This results in cerebral ischemia, which manifests clinically as transient, repetitive episodes of hemiplegia, dysarthria, and involuntary movements. This case report documents a patient in whom an initial extracranial-intracranial bypass (superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery) failed to alleviate the ischemic symptoms. In a subsequent procedure, a pedicle graft of omentum was created and through a subcutaneous tunnel was placed on the right cerebral cortex. Over a 2 1/2-year period, this has resulted in a dramatic resolution of the patient's symptomatology. The report delineates the condition and reviews other therapeutic options.
