A 29-year-old male with Down's syndrome presented with severe headache and vomiting. Computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage. Left carotid angiography showed severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery 2 cm distal to its origin, as well as abnormal hyper-vascularization near the stenosis site similar to that seen in moyamoya disease. Right carotid angiography showed no abnormalities. However, slight stenosis of the distal part of the bilateral vertebral arteries was noted. There was no aneurysm. We judged that the subarachnoid hemorrhage had been caused by rupture of the moyamoya-like vessel. Some patients with Down's syndrome have anatomical vascular abnormality and vascular fragility. The cerebral vascular abnormality found in this case may be part of the systemic vascular abnormalities associated with Down's syndrome. The vascular changes in some adult patients with Down's syndrome may be a sign of premature aging, and long-term studies with periodic vascular examination of patients with Down's syndrome need to be performed.
