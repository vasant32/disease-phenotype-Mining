An infant with neurofibromatosis developed recurrent cerebrovascular accidents beginning at 3 months of life. Cerebral arteriography demonstrated large-vessel occlusive disease and bilateral severe moyamoya. At autopsy these lesions were apparent on gross examination, and advanced intimal and medial dysplasia was seen on microscopic examination of both the anterior and posterior circulations. Although rare, neurofibromatosis cerebrovasculopathy may occur in young infants and may account for some strokes in this age group.
