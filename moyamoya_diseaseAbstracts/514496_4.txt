This report concerns a hypertensive woman who suffered a stroke at the age of 51 and recovered from left hemiparesis after 3 to 4 months. During the subsequent 24 years she had four seizures which involved the left arm and face and became generalized, ending with left hemiparesis, from which she recovered after 4 to 5 days. Carotid angiography was performed in 1967, 1973 and 1974 and the characteristic picture of moyamoya disease was demonstrated. She died at the age of 77 with extensive vascular disease. The literature concerning 215 cases of moyamoya disease, in which there were 14 intracerebral hematomas, is reviewed and discussed.
