This paper demonstrates usual and unusual findings on MR imaging (MRI) including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion- and perfusion-weighted image and MR angiography (MRA) in 30 patients with sickle cell cerebrovascular disease. This paper also illustrates the underlying pathophysiology of sickle cell cerebrovascular disease by using the cases with usual and unusual MR findings, including long-time follow-up cases during transfusion therapy. MRI and MRA are useful in defining the basis for stroke and assessing the effects of chronic transfusion therapy.
