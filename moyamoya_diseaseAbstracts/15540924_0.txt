Moyamoya disease is characterized by constrictions of segments of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and a resultant abnormal anastomotic network. In the literature, visual disturbances from cerebrovascular accidents in patients with moyamoya disease have been described, but very few reports of intraocular pathological conditions have been published. The authors describe a patient with moyamoya disease who presented with chorioretinal atrophy; an association between these two diseases has not previously been reported in the literature. Findings of a clinical ophthalmological evaluation and angiographic series are presented. During the fundic examination, evidence of chorioretinal atrophy was found in this patient. Choroidal vascular insufficiency was revealed by intravenous fluorescein angiography and occlusion of the ICAs proximal to the origin of the posterior communicating arteries by selective carotid and vertebral arteriography. The vertebrobasilar system provided anastomotic connections via the posterior communicating arteries. This is the first case report of chorioretinal atrophy associated with moyamoya disease. It is believed that the vasoocclusive effects of moyamoya disease may predispose the patient to atrophic changes in the peripheral retina. The development of an anastomotic network precludes the progression of this fundic anomaly.
