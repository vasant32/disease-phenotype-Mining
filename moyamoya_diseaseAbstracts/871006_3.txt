Twelve patients with Moyamoya syndrome were examined by computerized tomography (CT); nine children and three adults. In one patient, CT was normal. Significant abnormalities on the precontrast CT in the remaining 11 patients were: cortical atrophy with or without varying degree of ventricular dilatation, and irregularly shaped, various sized, often multiple or bilateral lucent foci in the cortex, subcortical white matter and the central gray matter. After contrast enhancement, no significant increase in the attenuation number was observed in and around the lucent foci except in one patient. In three patients, there was a slight increase in density in the central gray matter, however the increase in density was slight when the dense angiographic vascular networks in the basal ganglia were considered.
