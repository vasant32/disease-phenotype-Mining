We encountered a case of moyamoya disease which exhibited intracerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage followed by cerebral infarction in a short time. A 39-year-old female presenting with sudden onset disturbance of consciousness was admitted to our hospital. Radiological investigation on admission revealed intracerebral hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe and intraventricular hemorrhage due to moyamoya disease. The patient experienced cerebral infarction of the left frontotemporal area with brain swelling after 20 hours had passed. In spite of immediate left frontotemporal craniectomy and evacuation of the hematoma, she died 9 days after the operation. This case indicates that adequate control of intracranial pressure such as ventricular drainage is important to prevent progression of ischemic attack at an early stage. But it is not known what case of cerebral hemorrhage due to moyamoya disease would be complicated by cerebral infarction. The detection of the patient's consciousness level at an early stage could be a landmark to prevent further ischemic complications.
