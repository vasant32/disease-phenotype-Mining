Ischaemic strokes and neurological deterioration have been described after revascularisation surgery in patients with moyamoya disease, but accelerated acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery after burr hole surgery has not been reported in this setting. A 66-year-old woman with known moyamoya disease who presented with right motor weakness underwent burr hole surgery for a bilateral chronic subdural haematoma. Postoperatively, the patient had a crescendo transient ischaemic attack and then deteriorated. Angiography showed complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Burr hole surgery may cause postoperative acute occlusion of a preexisting stenotic artery in patients with moyamoya disease.
