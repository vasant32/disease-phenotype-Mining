BACKGROUND: Indirect cerebral revascularization has been generally accepted in the management of brain ischemia in moyamoya disease. We performed indirect cerebral revascularization by using omental flap and muscle flap techniques for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Ten patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease including three with adult moyamoya disease underwent this procedure (omental flap on eight sides and muscle flap on five sides). The muscle used for the flap was the serratus anterior muscle on two sides and shaved latissimus dorsi muscle on three sides. Angiography and cerebral blood flow studies were performed in all patients preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients demonstrated severely impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity due to occlusive disease. RESULTS: There was one patient each with perioperative death and intracranial infection following omental flap loss, and two patients had perioperative strokes. The average follow-up period was 23.2 months. Of the nine surviving patients, all eight except for the one with flap loss had good outcome with complete resolution of neurologic episodes. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that this method seems to be effective in selected patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
