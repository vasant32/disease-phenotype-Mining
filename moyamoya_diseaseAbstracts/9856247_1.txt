Persistent embryological carotid-basilar anastomoses are rare. There has been no report on persistent anastomosis between the accessory meningeal artery and the antero-superior cerebellar artery. We describe a 3-year-old boy with moyamoya disease manifesting such a congenital vascular anomaly, namely, a large anastomosis between the accessory meningeal artery and the antero-superior cerebellar artery associated with marked hypoplasia of the basilar artery. This persistent vascular anomaly is considered embryologically as an additional variant of the persistent primitive trigeminal artery, i.e., a "stapedo-trigemino-cerebellar" variant.
