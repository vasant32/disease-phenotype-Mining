Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disease characterized radiologically by progressive narrowing and occlusion of the arteries contributing to the circle of Willis and its branches. There is formation of an exuberant collateral network of blood vessels at the base of the brain, which is thought to arise in response to chronic ischemia. Clinically, the course is variable, with patients having repeated transient ischemic attacks, strokes, migraine, and seizures. Effective treatment is not available. The etiology and pathophysiology of moyamoya disease are largely unknown. Two patients with arteriographically proven moyamoya disease were identified. Both patients were symptomatic before age 5 years. Despite successful encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis revascularization procedures, they continued to experience an inexorable downhill course. A calcium channel blocker (nicardipine HCl) was introduced in order to prevent further symptoms. After the introduction of nicardipine, no further strokes occurred in either patient. There were no further episodes of transient ischemic attacks, seizures, or headache in one patient and decreased frequency in the other. In patients with moyamoya disease, nicardipine may have a beneficial effect on cerebral hemodynamics and may prevent ischemic sequelae by optimizing existing collateral circulation.
