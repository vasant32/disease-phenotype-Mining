In order to evaluate the adequacy of materials utilized for synangiosis in Moyamoya disease, angiogenic activities of various human tissues were examined. Tissue samples were freshly obtained at operation. A small piece of the sample was placed on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and, using an operative microscope, the production of neovascularization was evaluated 96 hours later. The scalp artery (STA and OA) showed the highest activity of angiogenesis, followed by the omentum and galea, while the temporal muscle, dura mater, and fat tissue showed poor activity. Histological examination confirmed the development of vasculature in CAM. The production of neovascularization is known to be related to the tissue content of the angiogenic factor (AF). The AF is known to be present in the vascular endothelial cell, fibroblast, tumor, brain, or omentum, etc. The rationale for the selection of materials for the neovascularization in Moyamoya disease was discussed in relation to its ability to produce new vessels.
