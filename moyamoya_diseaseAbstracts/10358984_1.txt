A 7-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl presented with moyamoya disease showing atypical angiographic findings. In these cases, the internal carotid artery (ICA) had a tapering occlusion just distal to the origin of the ophthalmic artery, whereas the top of the ICA was not occluded and was retrogradely supplied through the posterior communicating artery from the posterior circulation. Surgical treatment resolved the symptoms in both patients. Moyamoya disease may include a number of variant types not showing all the characteristic angiographic findings of moyamoya disease.
