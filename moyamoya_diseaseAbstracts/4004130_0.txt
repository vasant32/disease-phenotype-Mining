A 7 year old girl with moyamoya disease presented with progressive right arm and leg weakness and muteness. Intravenous administration of verapamil was followed by immediate and lasting improvement in motor function and return of some expressive language. A second infusion of verapamil during angiography produced an increased opacification of collateral vessels in the left basal ganglia, suggesting drug-induced vasodilation and reversal of ischaemia as a mechanism for the observed clinical improvement. Calcium-channel blockers may be useful in the acute management of selected patients with moyamoya disease.
