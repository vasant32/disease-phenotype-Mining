We performed coronary artery bypass grafting in an urgent and rare case of acute coronary syndrome with moyamoya disease in a 75-year-old female. Because of collateral dependent severe cerebrovascular obstruction, additional support for brain protection was necessary; we used high pressure pulsatile perfusion assist to maintain cerebral circulation with an intra-aortic balloon pump support throughout the cardiopulmonary bypass, giving a successful outcome.
