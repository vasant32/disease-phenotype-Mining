Moya Moya is a rare disease of uncertain origin, characterised by stenosis of one or both of the internal carotid arteries and responsible of several neurological signs. We present the case of a boy with Moya Moya disease who was scheduled for an epiphisiodesis of the lateral malleola and had a spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 10 mg without any perioperative complications. Any anaesthetic method could be used, provided special attention is given to avoid changes of capnea and blood pressure to preserve cerebral blood flow and palliate to cerebral flow steal.
