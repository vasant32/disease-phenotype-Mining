During the early arterial phase of a case of moyamoya disease, the radionuclide cerebral angiogram showed abnormal increased perfusion at the surface and the base of the head, but there was no recognizable activity in either middle cerebral artery. Contrast angiography demonstrated bilateral occlusion at the carotid siphon, characteristic net-like vascularities in the base of the brain, many anastomotic connections between the dural and cerebral branches, and collateral transdural circulation. The combination of radionuclide angiography, static brain imaging and CT scanning proved useful in investigating moyamoya disease.
