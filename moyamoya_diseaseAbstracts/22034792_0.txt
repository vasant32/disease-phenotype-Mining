Moyamoya vascular pattern and dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) are rare vascular abnormalities and both can be secondary to head trauma. The role of dural angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of vascular malformation is rather unclear. We report a unique case of moyamoya vasculopathy simultaneously associated with dAVF after heavy head trauma. It seems that both moyamoya syndrome and dAVFs are associated with dural angiogenesis induced by head trauma. The interrelationship between vascular abnormalities is complex and unclear.
