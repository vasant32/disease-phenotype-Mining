We previously reported the first Caucasian monozygotic twins with moyamoya disease (MMD). In both patients, hyperventilation induced similar transient onset of left arm and hand paresthesias. Cerebral single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) showed overlapping perfusion abnormalities in the left parietal areas. Similarly, EEG showed high amplitude, bilateral, anterior, slow wave activity in the delta range during hyperventilation and rebuild-up phenomenon in both twins. Similar clinical symptoms mirrored alterations in regional cerebral perfusion by SPECT and EEG in our Caucasian monozygotic twins with MMD.
