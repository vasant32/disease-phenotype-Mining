Three cases with seizures induced by movement are presented. These patients were a 24-year-old man, a 15-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy respectively. In each case, the onset began at the age of thirteen. The following characteristics were observed in all cases. The attacks were precipitated by sudden initiation of voluntary movement after rest. The attacks were brought on, for instance, by running quickly from a standing position, and were characterized by tonic spasm or choreoathetotic movement of unilateral extremities. They lasted only 5 - 10 seconds, without loss of consciousness and occurred up to ten times daily. Between the attacks there were no abnormalities. Neurological examination and laboratory findings were all negative. EEG at rest showed normal findings in two cases and abnormality in one case. Cerebral angiograms did not show any abnormalities in any of the cases. On CT scans and MRI, mild dilatation of lateral ventricles was observed in one case. One of these three cases was familial. Concerning treatment, carbamazepine was the most effective means to inhibit the attacks in all three cases. Seizures induced by movement may suggest moyamoya disease to neurosurgeons who are not familiar with this disease, so it is important to be able to recognize this disease when it is encountered.
