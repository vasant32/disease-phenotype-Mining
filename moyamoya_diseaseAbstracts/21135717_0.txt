 BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: We first report 2 patients in whom dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVFs) developed after cerebral infarction. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: One patient was a 49-year-old man who had a right embolic stroke 6 months after his first ischemic attack. Angiograms showed a de novo left transverse sigmoid sinus dAVF. One year later, shunt flow through the dAVF was increased. The second patient was a 45-year-old woman who presented with right cerebral infarction and moyamoya disease. Three weeks later, she underwent right superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass. Ten months after the operation, angiograms showed the development of dAVFs in the left transverse sigmoid sinus and progressive moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: We document the first patients with cerebral infarction and progressive moyamoya disease in whom a de novo dAVF developed. Moyamoya disease and dAVF are associated with an increase in dural angiogenic factors, and ischemia induces their increase. This may be the mechanism by which vaso-occlusive ischemia contributes to the formation of de novo dAVFs.
