Moyamoya disease is one of the cerebrovascular disorders and is characterized by bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries and their main branches. Repeated ischemic episodes in children and intracranial hemorrhage in adults with moyamoya disease is usually noted. In this report, we describe two children with moyamoya disease who presented with alternating hemiplegia. The final diagnosis was made by cerebral angiography and cranial computed tomography in these patients. Other neurological and radiological features of the patients were described.
