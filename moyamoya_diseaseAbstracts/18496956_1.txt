There is little information concerning clinical data and revascularization procedures in adult European patients with Moyamoya disease. More data are available on juvenile European Moyamoya angiopathy and its microsurgical therapies. This analysis summarizes our clinical experience in European adult patients with Moyamoya angiopathy. Nine adult European patients underwent surgical revascularization for Moyamoya angiopathy between 1997 and 2005. Direct intracranial-extracranial (EC-IC) bypass was considered the primary surgical modality. In case of unsuitable donor or recipient arteries, encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) was chosen as an indirect modality. The current analysis confirms that direct EC-IC-bypass is a feasible option for most cases of adult European Moyamoya disease. Exact definition of long-term benefits would require a multicentric study. EMS appears to be of questionable value in the adult European population.
