Anesthetic management during 85 STA-MCA anastomoses with or without encephalo-myosynangiosis for 64 patients with Moyamoya disease was evaluated retrospectively. Anesthetic agents included nitrous oxide-NLA (GONLA), nitrous oxide-halothane (GOF), nitrous oxide-enflurane (GOE), and their combinations. Slight hypercarbia (40 mmHg less than PaCO2 less than 50 mmHg) was essential to avoid cerebral ischemia. Several procedures to control heart rate by beta blockade or to control hypertension by nitroglycerin were required, because tachycardia and hypertension interfered with fine surgical procedure. During microsurgery HR of GONLA anesthetized patients was significantly lower. Postoperatively the patients anesthetized by GOE showed significantly lower PaCO2 compared with the GONLA anesthetized patients. So we recommend GONLA for anastomosis in patients with Moyamoya disease.
