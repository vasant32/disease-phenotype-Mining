Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is an uncommon association of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We describe a seven-year-old chinese girl with NF1 and unilateral MMS with multiple hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. The ischaemic lesions in the ipsilateral white matter were hypointense on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images, in contrast to the hyperintense "unidentified bright objects" (UBOs) of NF1. Neuroradiologists should be aware of associated MMS in NF1 patients, and distinguish the effects of ischaemia from UBOs, especially on FLAIR MR imaging.
