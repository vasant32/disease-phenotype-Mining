Several groups have reported partial resolution of moyamoya vessels following surgical revascularization in pediatric patients, but angiographic documentation of near-complete resolution has been poor. We report here a case of a 5-year-old boy who underwent bilateral superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass combined with unilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis who demonstrated near-complete resolution of moyamoya vessels and a dramatic improvement in cerebral perfusion as measured by xenon-enhanced CT. The resolution of moyamoya networks may serve as an indicator of successful surgical revascularization.
