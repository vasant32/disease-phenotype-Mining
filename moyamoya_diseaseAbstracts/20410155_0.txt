Primitive neuroectodermal tumor is a rare brain tumor composed of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated neuroepithelial cells with a high malignant potential that usually occurs in children, and which is only occasionally encountered in adults. A 19-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with right hemiparesis and a headache of 10 days duration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a large solid mass with necrotic portions in the left frontoparietal lobe. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor was confirmed by a neuronavigator-guided brain biopsy. This is the first case report of primitive neuroectodermal tumor associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and moyamoya disease. This case demonstrates that brain tumors, such as primitive neuroectodermal tumor, should be included in the differential diagnosis of neurological manifestations in children and adolescent patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
