Moyamoya disease is characterized occlusion of Willis' artery ring and abnormal "moyamoya" vessels. By supplying sufficient blood flow to the distal area of the stenosis or occlusion, ischemic symptom could be improved and the risk of the hemorrhage are lessen. Encephalo-Myo-Synangiosis (EMS) can increase the blood supply from external carotid artery to the ischemic area just put the temporal muscle on the brain surface. A kind of growth factor are thought to be exist around the brain of the Moyamoya disease patient. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) contribute angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. This effect is considered to grow tumors and many experiments are done to use it for therapy by blocking this effect. Few trials are done to utilize the angiogenetic effect for therapy. We studied the effect of the bFGF on angiogenesis after EMS by using rats. We operated EMS on 10 male SDrats. 0.1 microgram of the bFGF was poured on 5 rats between the brain and muscle. On the other 5 rats just saline was poured. One week after rats were sacrificed, new vessels were observed with light microscope and scanning electron microscope. Molding models were also observed. bFGF group grew larger new vessels between the brain and muscle than non bFGF group. On the surface of brain, bFGF had more larger vessels (diameter is over 6 um) and non bFGF group had more small vessels (less than 6 um). Total area of vessel of bFGF group was twice as large as that of non bFGF group. On molding models many closed end of vessels were seen and they were thought to be the growing vessels. In molding models, bFGF group also has larger vessels than non bFGF group. We could prove that bFGF promotes angiogenesis on EMS of the rats, and we also expect that bFGF help the supplying blood flow of the Moyamoya patient.
