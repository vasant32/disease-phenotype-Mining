 INTRODUCTION: Glioma and moyamoya syndrome are both potential complications of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Here, we report the first case of NF1 concomitantly presenting with glioblastoma 10 years after surgical treatment of moyamoya syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy with NF1 was incidentally diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a thalamic tumor during a follow-up for moyamoya syndrome, which had been treated with surgery 10 years earlier. After observation for 36 months, he developed left hemiparesis, and MRI revealed an increase in tumor size and obstructive hydrocephalus due to the tumor. Needle biopsy was performed through small craniotomy, and the histological diagnosis was glioblastoma. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy with 23 cycles of temozolomide, partial response of the tumor was observed. However, 24 months after the start of the initial therapy, the tumor showed regrowth, and the patient died 30 months after the initial therapy. No cerebrovascular events associated with moyamoya syndrome and chemoradiotherapy were observed during the clinical course of glioblastoma. DISCUSSION: Glioblastoma is a fatal disease in children, and our patient successfully received chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide despite the diagnoses of NF1 and moyamoya syndrome. Although radiotherapy or chemotherapy potentially causes cerebrovascular complications, chemoradiotherapy might be feasible for glioblastoma treatment in patients with moyamoya syndrome and NF1. The following issues are discussed in the management of the present case: the indication of biopsy in NF1 cases, the method of surgery, and the treatment protocol for tumors concomitant with moyamoya disease or syndrome.
