We report the case of conduction aphasia due to injury of the right hemisphere of the brain. The patient was a right-handed male in his fifties with moyamoya disease. T2-weighted MRI showed an extensive high intensity area in the right temporal-parietal-occipital lobes. In the case of language-related symptoms, comprehension was preserved, but phonemic paraphasias were frequent, and kana paragraphias were also observed. Despite the extensive injury of the right hemisphere, these language-related symptoms were consistent with the clinical features of conduction aphasia. Therefore, this patient was diagnosed with atypical crossed aphasia. Improvement in the phonemic paraphasia differed between words and nonsense words, suggesting that the improvement was dependent on the level of meaning of the words.
