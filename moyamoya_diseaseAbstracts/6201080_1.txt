Increased concentrations of PF4 and beta TG were found in two patients with Moya-Moya disease. Although the pathogenesis of these abnormalities is unknown, the increased concentration of these proteins may result from platelet activation in the abnormal vascular network, leading to platelet aggregation and secretion of these two platelet-derived proteins, or alternatively, the increased concentration of these proteins may be the result of platelet aggregation due to a defect in endothelial prostaglandin production.
