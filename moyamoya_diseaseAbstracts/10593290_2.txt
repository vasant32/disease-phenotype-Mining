We report here a rare case of moyamoya-like vessels combined with brain anomaly. MR imaging revealed a small corpus callosum and stenosis of the internal carotid arteries. T2-weighted images revealed multiple hyperintense lesions in the cerebral deep white matter, suggesting ischemic or abnormal myelinated tissues. Cerebral angiography showed aplastic carotid siphons and anomalous aneurysmal dilatation of the petrous portion of the internal carotid arteries. The terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries and horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery were stenotic with moyamoya-like vessels.
