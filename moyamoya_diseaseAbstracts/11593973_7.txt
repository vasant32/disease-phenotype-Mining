Three patients with bleeding-type moyamoya disease suffered ischemic complications following their first episode of intracranial bleeding. The patients presented with intraventricular hemorrhage and suffered cerebral infarction on the 14th, 16th, and 11th days after the ictus, respectively. The clinical records revealed no obvious hypotension before progression to infarction and suggested that dehydration accelerated by the administration of hyperosmotic drugs was a contributing factor to the infarction. Two patients underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomoses in the chronic stages and have never experienced further ischemic complications. The other patient died despite receiving intensive care. Hemodynamic reserve may be severely impaired in patients with bleeding-type moyamoya disease. Adequate control of hydration is important to prevent cerebral infarction after intracranial bleeding in patients with moyamoya disease.
