We report a black girl with sickle cell anemia. On prophylactic exchange transfusion protocol, she experienced cerebrovascular accidents at 3 and 3.5 years of age, both associated with transient right hemiparesis. At 7.5 years of age, she presented with a partial motor seizure and a left hemiparesis. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated stenosis at the origins of both middle and anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally with extensive basal collateralization. She underwent uncomplicated bilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) procedures using both superficial temporal arteries. At age 9 years, the patient presented with a severe headache and tunnel vision secondary to a stenosis of both posterior cerebral arteries. She underwent bilateral EDAS procedures using both occipital arteries. No complication was encountered. Postoperative cerebral angiogram demonstrated impressive neovascularity at the sites of all four EDAS procedures. Different treatment options of moyamoya disease are discussed.
