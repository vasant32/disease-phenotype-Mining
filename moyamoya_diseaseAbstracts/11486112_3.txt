BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-resolution turbo MR angiography with zero-filling interpolation (ZFI) technique is a new vascular imaging method with reduced scan time. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate high-resolution turbo MR angiography for the diagnosis and assessment of moyamoya disease. METHODS: Forty-six patients suspected of having moyamoya disease were examined with high-resolution turbo MR angiography with the ZFI technique, MRI, and conventional angiography. Moyamoya disease was diagnosed in 42 of these patients. Blind, separate interpretation of the images was performed. RESULTS: High-resolution turbo MR angiography and MRI accurately evaluated 349 (95%) and 325 (88%) of 368 arteries, respectively, but the degree of stenosis was overestimated in the other arteries. MR angiography and MRI depicted basal cerebral moyamoya vessels in 82 (98%) and 82 (98%) of 84 hemispheres, respectively. MR angiography also depicted leptomeningeal and transdural collateral vessels in 51 (100%) of 51 hemispheres and in 38 (88%) of 43 hemispheres, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of high-resolution turbo MR angiography for the diagnosis of moyamoya disease were 98% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution turbo MR angiography in reduced scan time is highly accurate in the assessment of both steno-occlusive lesions and collateral vessels in moyamoya disease, thus providing a highly accurate (98%) diagnosis and assessment of moyamoya disease.
