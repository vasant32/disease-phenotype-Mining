Asymptomatic small hemorrhages were identified in hypertensive patients by T2*-weighted gradient echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to investigate the relationship between hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage and asymptomatic minute hemorrhages. Forty-eight patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction with hypertension (these diseases were defined as stroke) were treated in National Defense Medical College from April 1998 to February 2000. All patients had no past history of stroke or head injury, underwent MR imaging within 6 months of the stroke attack, were aged from 40 to 80 years, and had no diagnosis of aneurysm, angioma, or moyamoya disease. Patients were divided into the infarction group and hemorrhage group. All foci over 2 mm in size appearing as hypointense on T2*-weighted MR imaging and unrelated to stroke areas were defined as minute hemorrhages. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to sex, age, and history of diabetes mellitus. The incidence of minute hemorrhages in the hemorrhage group (21/26) was greater than in the infarction group (9/22, p < 0.01). The incidence of minute hemorrhages in the basal ganglia (18/26) was greater in the hemorrhage group than in the infarction group (4/22, p < 0.001). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage may be preceded by asymptomatic minute hemorrhage.
