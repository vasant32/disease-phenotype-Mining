The cause of Moyamoya disease is still unknown. We made a research about the factors closely related to Moyamoya disease through a case-control study. The number of cases studied was 66. Controls were selected from among patients' friends, matched as to sex, age and residential area. Questionnaires were sent to the cases and the respective controls by mail. The questions were about past history, developmental history, school records, habitual factors, dietary habits and pets. The first symptoms and age at onset were also surveyed in the cases. The response rate was 84.8% (56 cases) of the cases and 76.5% (101 cases) out of the 132 controls. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media, and bronchitis. Odds ratio of fever of unknown origin is 2.793 and X2 is 7.213. Diseases whose odds ratio was over 1 were herpes, appendicitis, bronchitis, asthma, anemia, dental caries, head injury and drug allergy. But all of them were not significantly prevalent. Odds ratios of school records were 4-9 and X2 were 4-17 from elementary to junior high school. Odds ratio of western dishes was 2.709 and X2 was 5.189. There was no significant difference as to pets kept. We could not find overt relationships between Moyamoya disease and diseases of head and neck like tonsillitis.
