Moyamoya disease is a chronically progressive and occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Steno-occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery occurs bilaterally, and fine vascular network gradually develops at the base of the brain and they act as collaterals to the distal portion of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Steno-occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery develops in accord with progression of the disease. Intracranial omental transplantation is one of the indirect bypass surgeries for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, especially in the territories of the anterior/posterior cerebral artery in moyamoya disease. In the present report, one of sixty-seven moyamoya disease patients who had been treated with intracranial omental transplantation, showed chronological change of the mass of the transplanted omentum in accord with decrease/increase in the patient's body weight. In addition, the patient experienced headache which appeared and disappeared in accord with increase and decrease in the patient's body weight, respectively. The transplanted omentum was thought to act in the same way as fat tissue in other portions of the body. Measurement of body weight is thought to be as important as radiological examination using computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging in the follow-up period after intracranial omental transplantation in moyamoya disease.
