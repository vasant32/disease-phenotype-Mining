OBJECTIVE: To study the etiological profile of childhood stroke and its relation with prothrombotic states. METHODS: Children with acute stroke with no evidence of CNS infection or head injury were studied. Stroke was confirmed by CT scan and further evaluated by MRI. Cardiac status was assessed with transthoracic echocardiography. Test for hypercoagulable state (antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, anticardiolipin antibody IgG and IgM and lupus anticoagulant) were done in all patients. RESULTS: A total of 66 children were enrolled--36 cases and 30 controls. Presenting symptoms were motor deficit (72%), seizure (66%), altered sensorium (36%), aphasia (27%). Causes identified were antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (25%), Moya Moya disease (16.6%), cardiac disease (11.1%), vasculitis (5.5%), ATIII deficiency (5.5%), Protein C deficiency (2.7%). Etiology remained unknown in 25% of cases with infarction. Hemorrhage was seen in 8.2% of cases and they had DIC or liver disease as the underlying cause. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic Resonance Angiography and ELISA for antiphospholipid antibody should be done in all patients with stroke without an obvious cause.
