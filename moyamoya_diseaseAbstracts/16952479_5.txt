We report a patient with moyamoya disease presenting with paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED). A 31-year-old lathe man developed recurrent attacks of paroxysmal hemichorea. The attacks always affected his left limbs and occurred either after several hours of working or while playing football. The duration of attacks ranged from 30 min to 4h. Attacks were not provoked by sudden movements, consumption of coffee or alcohol, hyperventilation, emotional stress, exposure to cold or passive movement. An MRI of the brain showed no parenchymal lesions. However, (99m)Tc-ethylcysteine dimer SPECT study showed hypoperfusion in the right striatum. Digital subtraction angiography showed stenosis of the right internal carotid and middle cerebral artery with prominent basal collaterals, which was compatible with moyamoya disease. Imaging studies of the cerebral arteries should be done in patients with clinical features of PED in order to detect possible cases of moyamoya disease.
