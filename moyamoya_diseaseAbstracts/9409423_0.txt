Some patients with Moyamoya disease require revascularization not only to the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) but also to that of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). To revascularize the ACA territory, we performed superficial temporal artery (STA)-ACA direct anastomosis in five patients with Moyamoya disease. After paramedian frontal craniotomy (approximately 5 cm diameter), STA-ACA anastomosis was carried out at the convexity using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient. An interposed STA graft was used in four patients: all of the grafts were shorter than 4 cm. Bypass flow was satisfactory in four patients. One patient who underwent simultaneous STA-ACA and STA-MCA anastomoses had poor bypass flow probably due to spontaneous leptomeningeal collateral channels between the ACA and MCA. Our method using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient and a branch of the STA for the interposed graft can be performed at the convexity and much easier than in a deep operative field. A short arterial graft does not easily occlude. The diameter of a branch of the STA is small and therefore, a size discrepancy does not present a problem. Our STA-ACA anastomosis method is useful and effective for revascularization of the ACA territory in any patients with Moyamoya disease.
