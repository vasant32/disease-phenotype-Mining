 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies were associated with the risk of moyamoya disease in pediatric subjects. METHODS: Thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies were evaluated in patients with moyamoya disease and control subjects, and their associations with moyamoya disease were estimated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We included 114 pediatric patients and 114 healthy control subjects. The patients displayed higher prevalence of increased thyroid function and elevated thyroid autoantibodies in comparison with control subjects. These remained significant after multivariate adjustment; the ORs (95% CI) for increased thyroid function and evaluated thyroid autoantibodies were evaluated as 12.47 (1.55 to 100.51) and 4.33 (1.29 to 14.59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased thyroid function and elevated thyroid autoantibodies are associated with moyamoya disease and therefore monitoring of thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies in patients with moyamoya disease is suggested, which might help to guide subsequent clinical management.
