Twenty Japanese children with Moyamoya disease were investigated by examining the multimodality evoked potentials (BAEPs, FVEPs and SSEPs). BAEPs were abnormally prolonged wave I-III and wave III-V in each one (10%). FVEPs were abnormal in 6 (30%), included prolonged latencies, reduced amplitudes and poor waveform in one each, and delayed latencies as well as reduced amplitudes in three. FVEPs significantly correlated with intellectual deterioration (p less than 0.01). SSEPs were abnormal in 13 (65%) significantly more frequent than BAEPs and FVEPs (p less than 0.01); reduction of N20 in 7, delayed latencies of N13-N20 in 4, and both delayed latencies and reduced amplitudes of N20 in two. These findings correlated well with the neurologic deficits, CT findings and EEG findings in this progressive cerebrovascular disease (Moyamoya disease) in children.
