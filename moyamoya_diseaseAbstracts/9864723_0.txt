The paper presents a case of moyamoya disease, with first clinical sign subarachnoid haemorrhage in a 19-year old woman with mental impairment. The CT screen shows the presence of ischaemic areas of haemorrhagic type. MR, angio-MR and classical angiography confirmed the presence of ischaemic areas with contraction of the distal parts of the internal carotid arteries and left anterior cerebral artery. Authors call attention to the diagnostic problems of the case and accent the very important role of MR and MR angiography in the diagnosis of moyamoya disease.
