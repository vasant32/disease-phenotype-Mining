Due to its low incidence in Western countries, physician awareness of juvenile Moyamoya disease should be improved. The benefits of revascularisation surgery have only been proven in the juvenile version of the disease. Therefore, early revascularisation may prevent irreversible ischaemic deficits and rapidly progressive mental retardation in young patients.From 1984 to 2009, a total of 19 children (mean age 8 years, range 1-18 years, female predominance 2:1, 17/19 European white patients, 2/19 Asian origin of at least one parent) were treated for juvenile Moyamoya disease by surgical revascularisation. The leading symptoms were epilepsy (17/19), followed by transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) or prolonged reversible ischaemic neurologic deficits (PRIND) (15/19) and mental retardation (11/19). Angiography showed a clear neovascularisation in the majority of patients after indirect bypasses after 6 months. The mean follow-up was 17 years and 3 months (maximum 25 years, minimum 2 years). Two patients were lost to follow-up. In accordance with the literature, ischaemic symptoms were eliminated by the revascularisation operation in 94% of our patients with a very low rate of complications, and no lasting morbidity and mortality in any of the patients.Early diagnosis and surgical treatment seem to potentiate the benefits independently of the type of revascularisation procedure.
