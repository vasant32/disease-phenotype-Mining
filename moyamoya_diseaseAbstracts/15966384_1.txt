BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease is a rare neurovascular disorder that requires special anesthetic managements during revascularization procedures. We have investigated the incidence of early postoperative complications under inhaled anesthesia in comparison with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) retrospectively. METHODS: Seventy-two patients undergoing revascularization procedures were divided into two groups, one with inhaled anesthesia (n = 23) and the other with TIVA (n = 49). Surgical procedures were performed under normocapnia, proper body temperature, and all patients were prevented from anemia by homologous transfusion. To avoid the variance in anesthetic managements, 39 patients under 15 years of age were picked up and divided in the same way as above. Early postoperative complications including transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction during the first 2 weeks after operation were investigated. RESULTS: In all patients, early postoperative complications occurred in 48% of inhaled anesthesia group and in 49% of TIVA group. In patients under 15, these complications occurred in 44% and in 57%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two anesthetic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Several previous studies reported the excellence of TIVA for revascularization procedure on the basis of regional blood flow because inhaled anesthesia may provoke intracerebral steal in moyamoya disease. Our investigation in this study revealed that both anesthetic methods have no significant difference in postoperative complications during the first 2 weeks after operation. Thus further study should be needed to verify the safety of inhalation anesthetics in patients with moyamoya disease.
