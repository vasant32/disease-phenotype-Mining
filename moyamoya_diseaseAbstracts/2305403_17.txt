To clarify the differences in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism between children and adults with bilateral moyamoya disease, we measured regional cerebral blood flow, regional oxygen extraction fraction, regional metabolic rate for oxygen, regional cerebral blood volume, and regional transit time using positron emission tomography in nine patients (five children and four adults) and compared the values with those in controls (four children with unilateral moyamoya disease and six normal adults). The major differences between pediatric and adult patients were in regional cerebral blood volume and regional oxygen extraction fraction. Regional cerebral blood volume was more markedly increased relative to the control value in the children than in the adults. Also, regional oxygen extraction fraction was greater than control in areas with low blood flow in the children but was never increased in the adults. However, in the adults, only regional transit time was significantly prolonged relative to the control values. The increased regional oxygen extraction fraction relative to the control value observed in children with moyamoya disease may explain why transient ischemic attacks are a common symptom in this group.
