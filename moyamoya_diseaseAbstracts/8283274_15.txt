Two cases of moyamoya disease associated with repeated intraventricular hemorrhage are reported. The origin of bleeding was thought to be a distal aneurysm of the choroidal artery. The aneurysms were confirmed radiologically and histologically. The relationship between moyamoya disease and aneurysms is discussed, and a treatment proposed.
