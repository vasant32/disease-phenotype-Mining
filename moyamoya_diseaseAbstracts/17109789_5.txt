The chickenpox virus (varicella zoster virus; VZV) is known to cause large and small vessel central nervous system vasculopathies that may be associated with strokes in both adults and children. We present the case of a female aged 2 years 6 months who developed a chronic progressive small-vessel vasculopathy with radiological features of moyamoya disease as a manifestation of congenital varicella syndrome. Clinically, the condition was characterized by recurrent ischaemic strokes, which were brought under control using intravenous acyclovir. The case is unique in that it is the first report of congenital varicella syndrome to occur after a maternal herpes zoster infection. Furthermore, it is the first case of symptomatic VZV infection in a child to occur after a maternal infection occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy.
