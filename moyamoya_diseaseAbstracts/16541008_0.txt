Pediatric patients show transient ischemic attacks or strokes; diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. The case of a 2-year-old female, which after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection presented multiple cerebral strokes is reported. A diagnosis of moyamoya disease was made on the basis of neuroradiological findings; neurological complications due to Mycoplasma infection are reported and the relationship between disease and infection are discussed.
