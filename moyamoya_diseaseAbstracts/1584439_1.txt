Moyamoya syndrome-specific alterations of EEG recordings are only observed in children. These consist of a gradual frequency decrease and amplitude activation after hyperventilation. This is referred to as re-build-up phenomenon. Thus, a tentative diagnosis of Moyamoya syndrome in children can be based on the EEG finding. This should be radiologically confirmed by angiography.
