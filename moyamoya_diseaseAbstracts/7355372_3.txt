A 27-year-old woman in the ninth month of her pregnancy suddently developed nausea and motor weakness of her right lower extremity while shopping. Subsequently a disturbance of consciousness and right-sided hemiparesis developed. Spinal puncture yielded clear CSF but CT scan demonstrated a left subependymal hematoma. Angiographical examination led to a diagnosis of "Moyamoya" disease. The source of the intracranial hemorrhage could not be identified. The hematoma could not have been diagnosed accurately without the CT scan.
