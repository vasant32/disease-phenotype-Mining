An 11-year-old girl with Down syndrome is reported with moyamoya syndrome; she presented with chorea and mental regression, but had no hemiplegia or convulsions. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were valuable for diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome. It is suggested that moyamoya syndrome be considered as a possible cause of involuntary movements in Down syndrome patients.
