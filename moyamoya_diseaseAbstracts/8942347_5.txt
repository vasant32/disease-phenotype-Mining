We report a case of moyamoya disease in a patient presenting for Caesarean section at 37 weeks' gestation. Extradural anaesthesia was administered using 0.5% bupivacaine and pethidine 25 mg. A stable haemodynamic state was produced using left lateral uterine displacement, i.v. crystalloids and an i.v. infusion of ephedrine. The patient suffered no neurological deficit and there was no significant intraoperative decrease in cerebral oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy.
