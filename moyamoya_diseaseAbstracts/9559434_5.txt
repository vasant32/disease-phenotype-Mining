Moyamoya disease is an occlusive intracranial arteriopathy with abnormal cerebral vascular collateral networks. Although this disease is known to be associated with stenosis of extracranial arteries, such as the renal artery, a case associated with stenoses of the coronary and renal arteries has not been reported. We described here a 23-year-old man who had effort angina, renovascular hypertension, and asymptomatic moyamoya disease. Arterioangiography revealed bilateral occlusion of the intracranial carotid arteries and stenoses in the left coronary artery and the left renal artery.
