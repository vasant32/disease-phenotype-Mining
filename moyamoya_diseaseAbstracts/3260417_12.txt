Moyamoya disease was diagnosed as the cause of cerebral infarction in eight young adults (seven women, one man), aged 17-40 (mean 33) years. All had angiographic abnormalities characteristic of moyamoya disease. Single-photon emission tomography showed bilateral carotid circulation hypoperfusion and posterior circulation hyperemia in all seven patients with regional cerebral blood flow studies. All seven women had used oral contraceptives before cerebral infarction. Four patients were treated medically; one died of a second cerebral infarction 9 months after diagnosis. Four patients underwent superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis; they did well. Moyamoya disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of cerebral infarction as well as intracranial hemorrhage in young adults, particularly women. A possible relation between moyamoya disease and oral contraceptive use deserves investigation.
