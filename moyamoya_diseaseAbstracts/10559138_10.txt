Moyamoya disease is a progressive cerebrovascular occlusive disease that primarily affects children. The cause is unknown. We examined the production of prostanoids and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) derived from patients with moyamoya disease. Twelve moyamoya and 8 control cell strains were examined. The steady-state levels of prostanoids in the culture medium did not differ between moyamoya and control SMCs. When the cells were stimulated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release into the medium was significantly greater from moyamoya SMCs than from control SMCs, whereas the amounts of prostacyclin and thromboxane B(2) did not differ. IL-1beta-induced PGE(2) production by moyamoya SMCs was completely blocked by the addition of indomethacin or NS-398. IL-1beta significantly stimulated cell migration and DNA synthesis in control SMCs but had an inhibitory effect on moyamoya SMCs. The inhibitory effects on the growth and migration of moyamoya SMCs were caused by excessive secretion of PGE(2) and was reversed with indomethacin treatment. Immunofluorescence studies and Western blot analysis showed greater amounts of COX-2 protein expression in IL-1beta-stimulated moyamoya SMCs. These findings suggest that moyamoya SMCs respond to inflammatory stimuli to produce excess amounts of PGE(2) through the activation of COX-2, which increases vascular permeability and decreases vascular tone. This facilitates the exposure of vessels to blood constituents and promotes the development of intimal thickening in moyamoya disease.
