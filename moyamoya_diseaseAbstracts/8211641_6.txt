Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed on eight patients diagnosed as Moyamoya disease. Angiographically, the patients-four adults (mean age 42) and four children (mean age 7.7)-underwent a complete six- or five-vessel angiographic study. The results showed the following: (1) Despite the presence of stenosis, all middle cerebral arteries showed very low-flow velocity compared to their ipsilateral distal internal carotid arteries. In adult cases, the difference was very significant (p < 0.02). (2) Relatively high-flow velocity was observed in the posterior cerebral arteries of children, and in the ophthalmic arteries of adult cases. (3) In several occasions, very low-flow velocity values were still detected despite the fact that with angiography, the respective arterial segments were hardly opacified. The relation and discrepancy between these results and the angiographic findings, and the potential application of transcranial doppler in assessing and grading the severity of moyamoya disease are discussed.
