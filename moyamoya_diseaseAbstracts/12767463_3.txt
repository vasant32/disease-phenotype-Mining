Moyamoya disease (M-M) is characterized by progressive obstruction of the supraclinoid portion of internal carotid arteries and the proximal middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, associated with the formation of a characteristic net of collateral vessels in the basal ganglia region. Clinical manifestations in childhood include transient ischaemic attacks, seizures and multiple infarcts. Approximately 7% of M-M cases are familial. We report two affected Greek siblings with typical clinical and neuroradiological findings of M-M. Linkage analysis of the whole family was consistent with linkage to the region 3p24-26, as previously reported in other familial Japanese M-M cases.
