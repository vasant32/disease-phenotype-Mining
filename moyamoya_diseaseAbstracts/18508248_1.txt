Moyamoya syndrome has rarely been reported in association with Down syndrome. We report on 2 cases in 3-year-old and 6-year-old female children with Down syndrome, who presented with neurological deficit. Imaging (magnetic-resonance angiography and digital-subtraction angiography) revealed the classical Moyamoya pattern. The neurological deficits persisted in both cases. One patient has developed epilepsy.
