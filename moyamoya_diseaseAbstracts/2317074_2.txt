We describe a boy who presented at the age of 7 years with short stature due to hypopituitarism. Six months after starting appropriate hormone replacement treatment at the age of 8 he suffered his first generalised convulsion. Further neuroradiological investigation led to the diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome.
