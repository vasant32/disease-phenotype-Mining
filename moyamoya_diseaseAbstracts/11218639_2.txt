A 26-year-old female with idiopathic moyamoya disease developed chest pain with concomitant ST depression on electrocardiography. Coronary angiography detected no stenotic lesions in the epicardial coronary arteries. The clinical diagnosis was vasospastic angina pectoris. She was medicated with calcium antagonists, which reduced the frequency of chest pain episodes. Angina pectoris is a rare occurrence in young patients with moyamoya disease. Coronary artery disease and moyamoya disease may have common etiological factors.
