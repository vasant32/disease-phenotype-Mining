 OBJECTIVE: Structural genetic variation, including copy-number variation (CNV), constitutes a substantial fraction of total genetic variability, and the importance of structural variants in modulating susceptibility is increasingly being recognized. CNV can change biological function and contribute to pathophysiological conditions of human disease. Its relationship with common, complex human disease in particular is not fully understood. Here, we searched the human genome to identify copy number variants that predispose to moya-moya type cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who had unilateral or bilateral steno-occlusive lesions at the cerebral artery from March, 2007, to September, 2009. For the 20 subjects, including patients with moyamoya type pathologies and three normal healthy controls, we divided the subjects into 4 groups : typical moyamoya (n=6), unilateral moyamoya (n=9), progression unilateral to typical moyamoya (n=2) and non-moyamoya (n=3). Fragmented DNA was hybridized on Human610Quad v1.0 DNA analysis BeadChips (Illumina). Data analysis was performed with GenomeStudio v2009.1, Genotyping 1.1.9, cnvPartition_v2.3.4 software. Overall call rates were more than 99.8%. RESULTS: In total, 1258 CNVs were identified across the whole genome. The average number of CNV was 45.55 per subject (CNV region was 45.4). The gain/loss of CNV was 52/249, having 4.7 fold higher frequencies in loss calls. The total CNV size was 904,657,868, and average size was 993,038. The largest portion of CNVs (613 calls) were 1M-10M in length. Interestingly, significant association between unilateral moyamoya disease (MMD) and progression of unilateral to typical moyamoya was observed. CONCLUSION: Significant association between unilateral MMD and progression of unilateral to typical moyamoya was observed. The finding was confirmed again with clustering analysis. These data demonstrate that certain CNV associate with moyamoya-type cerebrovascular disease.
