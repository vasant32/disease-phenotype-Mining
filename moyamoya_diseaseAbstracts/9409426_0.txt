Long term post-encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) intelligence quotient (IQ) evaluated by Wechsler tests stays around the normal range (mean full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) at 100.0 +/- 155, 100.0 +/- 15.7 and 100.2 +/- 163, respectively) at more than 9.5 years after the operation, provided that the patient has FIQ above 70 pre-operatively. This fact encourages us to employ operative treatment for this difficult disease in which intelligence deterioration has been reported to be a common occurrence.
