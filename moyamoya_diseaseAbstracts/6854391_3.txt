The authors report a case of multiple cerebral aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease, in which the reduction and disappearance of bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms and the new development and enlargement of bisilar artery aneurysms were demonstrated on sequential cerebral angiograms. Possible mechanisms of the spontaneous disappearance and development of cerebral aneurysms in association with moyamoya disease are discussed.
