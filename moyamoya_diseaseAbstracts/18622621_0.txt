INTRODUCTION: Pediatric Moyamoya disease is rarely associated with intracranial aneurysms. We report a case of a 7-year-old girl with an antecedent of persistent craniopharyngeal canal, who presented with a history of choreiform movements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Moyamoya disease was found with an unruptured left middle cerebral artery aneurysm on her first angiography. Conservative treatment was chosen for the aneurysm and she underwent indirect revascularization by encephalosynangiosis using the multiple bur-hole technique for her Moyamoya disease. Abnormal movements were improved. Control angiogram at 6 months showed development of intracranial-extracranial anastomoses with complete resolution of the aneurysm. Aneuryms including the major arteries of the basal arterial circle occur as a by-product of the high velocity and blood flow secondary to the arterial stenosis. Blood flow modification after revascularization often lead to spontaneous regression and disappearance of these aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Therefore, a conservative treatment of these proximal aneurysms must be chosen after encephalosynangiosis.
