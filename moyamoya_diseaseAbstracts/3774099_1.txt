In order to show the vascular anatomy in periventricular region, two adult cases of moyamoya disease with intracerebral hemorrhage extending into lateral ventricle were presented. And we discussed the relation between the vascular anatomy and the form of hemorrhage in moyamoya disease. The first case was a 46-year-old woman admitted for nausea and vomiting following headache for four days. CT scan revealed a high density area in the upper portion of body of right lateral ventricle showing intracerebral hemorrhage which extended into the lateral ventricle. On angiogram, typical moyamoya disease was noted. The ventriculofugal arteries from the posterior lateral choroidal artery was detected which indicated developed ventriculofugal perfusion. The second case was a 52-year-old man who was hospitalized sudden onset of headache, vomiting and consciousness disturbance. CT scan revealed a high density area suggesting of hemorrhage in the head of right caudate nucleus. It perforated into the right anterior horn of lateral ventricle with spreading over the other ventricles. We observed similar findings on the angiograms to the first case. In this case, however, the lateral striate arteries were involved instead of the posterior lateral choroidal artery. It should be pointed out that, in both cases, the area of hemorrhage in CT scan coincided with the area of developed ventriculofugal perfusion in angiograms.
