Moya-Moya disease is a chronic infrequent vasculopathy. Occasionally such abnormalities are found in association with one of many conditions, in these cases the angiographic abnormality should be termed Moya-Moya syndrome rather than Moya-Moya disease. Although in children the usual manifestations are ischemic events and seizures. This clinical presentation is infrequent in adults. We present a 42-years-old man with a 1-month history of recurrent right sided partial somatosensorial seizures, later he presented a left parietal infarction, the angiographic findings were compatible with moyamoya syndrome.
