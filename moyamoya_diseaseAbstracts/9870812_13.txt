BACKGROUND: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has a poor prognosis with mortality rates of between 80 and 100% when all four ventricles are involved. Fibrinolytic therapy has been reported to improve overall outcome. METHODS: Patients with severe primary IVH were treated by direct intraventricular injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) into the lateral ventricles, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage if the intracranial pressure rose above 20 mm Hg. RESULTS: Over a 15-month period from 1995 through 1996, 10 patients were treated, (4 male and 6 female, mean age 35 years; range, 21-55 years). The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 6 (range, 4-8) and the mean Graeb score for severity of IVH on the first CT scan was 10 (range, 8-12). Angiography was negative in five cases but identified arteriovenous malformations in three, a post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm in one, and Moya-moya disease in one. The mean total dose requirement of rt-PA was 8.25 mg (range, 6-12 mg) with a significant reduction in the mean Graeb score after 7 days to 3.9 (range, 2-7, p<0.0001). Outcome at 3 months was death in one case (mortality 10%), severe disability in two (20%), moderate disability in three (30%), and good result in four (40%). Four patients (40%) required subsequent CSF shunting. No complications of rehemorrhage, infection, or catheter obstruction were encountered. CONCLUSION: Intraventricular fibrinolysis with rt-PA seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe IVH.
