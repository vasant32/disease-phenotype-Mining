The change of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with aging was analyzed in 9 cases of moyamoya disease whose age ranged from 16 years old to 58 years old. CBF decreased more prominently in the various lobes with aging than control subjects and the decrement was more rapid in the affected side than in the non-affected side. CBF was thought to decrease with the hemorrhagic attack and the accompanying neurological deterioration. However the gradually-deteriorating brain damages caused by the chronic hypoperfusion also might be engaged in this CBF decrement.
