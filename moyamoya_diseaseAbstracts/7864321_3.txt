A woman who suffered an intracerebral haemorrhage secondary to Moyamoya disease in her 33rd week of pregnancy was sedated for ventilation with propofol for 48 h until she underwent emergency Caesarean section. There appeared to be no adverse metabolic effects on the neonate from the use of propofol in the mother although sedation was prolonged.
