INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya (MM) disease is a rare steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease known to occur in children and adults. The most serious complications in children are developmental delay and mental retardation due to recurrent hemodynamic stroke. CASES: We report two pediatric patients without coagulopathy who suffered from severe arterio-embolic ischemic complications despite antiplatelet medication. DISCUSSION: These observations underline the potential impact of cerebral thromboembolism on the pathophysiology of the stroke and thus on the treatment of children with MM disease.
