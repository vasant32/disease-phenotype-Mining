PURPOSE: To study the hemodynamic characteristics of moyamoya disease with color Doppler (CD) and power Doppler (PD) sonography. METHODS: The hemodynamic parameters of intracranial and extracranial arteries from 17 patients with moyamoya disease confirmed via digital subtraction angiography and 30 healthy controls were studied with conventional and transcranial CD and PD. RESULTS: The moyamoya vessels were detected as scattered color Doppler signal with low velocity and a low resistance index (RI) at the base of the brain in 10 of the 17 patients. The RI of the common carotid arteries and the internal carotid arteries of the patients was significantly higher, whereas the peak velocity was lower than in controls. The posterior carotid arteries were more frequently involved in children (43.8%) than in adults (5.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial CD and PD can be used to demonstrate the stenosis and occlusion of intracranial arteries and the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain in most cases. Combined with the hemodynamic characteristics of extracranial arteries and the symptoms of the patients, an accurate diagnosis of moyamoya disease could be made in the majority of cases using PD.
