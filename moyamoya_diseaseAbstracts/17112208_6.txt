A long-term assessment was performed to determine the posttreatment clinical course of 113 patients with moyamoya disease. All patients sustained cerebral ischemic attacks and underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with or without temporal muscle grafting. The follow-up duration was 3 to 24 years (mean 14.4 +/- 5.8 [standard deviation]). Complete cessation of the ischemic episodes was obtained in 110 of 113 patients. One hundred patients were able to return to independent acitvities of daily living. Intellectual delays prevented 24 patients from engaging in an independent social life . Although intracranial bleeding is one of the common manifestations in moyamoya disease, hemorrhage was not detected in the 113 patients who underwent cerebral revascularization.
