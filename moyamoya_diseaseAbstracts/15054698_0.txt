A ten-year-old girl arrived at the hospital with progressive loss of muscular strength on the right side of the body. The cranial MRI showed left fronto-parietal ischemia and atrophic changes in the left parietal lobe. Brain MRI initially disclosed a narrow left MCA. MRA and digital angiography confirmed the diagnosis of brain obstructive chronic vascular disease (Moyamoya). Angiography results demonstrated occlusion of the left MCA and right posterior cerebral artery, with Moyamoya vessels. It therefore appears that in some patients Moyamoya disease is accompanied by posterior circulation involvement.
