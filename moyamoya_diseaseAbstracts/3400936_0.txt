Authors review 53 children, aged 0 to 14 years, affected with cerebrovascular ischemic strokes. Largest aetiological groups were: a) congenital heart disease, 16 patients; b) arteritis of unknown cause, 11; c) idiopathic arterial occlusion without arteritis images on angiography, 7; d) moyamoya disease, 6; and d) local or systemic infections, 5. The mode of onset was as completed stroke in 72% and stroke in evolution in 24%. After acute stage 17.6% of patients presented other definitive strokes, 11.7% suffered only transient ischemic strokes (TIA), and 4% reversible ischemic neurologic deficits (RIND). Mean follow-up was 4.36 years, 9.8% of patients died, 11.8% recovered completely and 52.9% improved after initial stroke. Poor global evolution was associated with heart disease (p less than 0.05) and with onset of strokes before age 2 (p less than 0.05). Most important sequelae, besides motor impairment, were epilepsy (49%) and mental retardation (50% got less than IQ 80). Late epilepsy was associated with seizures at onset (p less than 0.05). Clinical factors of adverse mental development were: a) seizures at onset, b) late epilepsy and c) stroke before age 2. 66% of cases had two or more arterial lesions in the same or in different arterial trees. Therefore, embolic and arteritic factors probably play an important role in infancy and childhood stroke.
