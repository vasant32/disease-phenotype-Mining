We describe four children with moyamoya disease who developed neurologic deterioration following revascularization surgery. In all cases, anesthesia was smoothly induced and the intraoperative course was uneventful. Emergence from anesthesia was prompt and no new neurological deficit was observed. However, the children suffered strokes on 2, 4, 5, and 10 days, postoperatively, respectively. Dehydration and crying were thought to be closely associated with the stroke in each case. This report suggests that attention should be paid during entire the perioperative period to avoid stroke in patients with moyamoya disease.
