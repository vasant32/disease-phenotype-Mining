Though diffusion-weighted images (DWI) have been increasingly used to detect super-acute-phase cerebral infarction in recent years, they have primarily been obtained through the use of high magnetic machines of more than 1.5T. In this study, we discussed the usefulness of DWI obtained using 0.5T MRI in comparison with CT, MRI (FLAIR and T2 weighted image) and SPECT (99mTc-HMPAO). DWI were able to detect ischemic lesions earlier than FLAIR or T2-weighted images. Scanning time was short at four seconds for eight slices, and the quality of image was sufficient for clinical usage. The most available b-value seems to be 800. There were less susceptibility artifacts in the 0.5T DWI than in the 1.5T DWI. From these data, we presume that it is possible to detect super-acute-phase cerebral ischemia on the 0.5T DWI, proving the clinical usefulness of DWI. Furthermore, DWI is considered useful in observing chronological changes in cerebral infarction, differentiation of abscess or brain tumor, diagnosis of moyamoya disease, degenerative disease and so on.
