 BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is a time-honored, crucial procedure employed in the management of well-selected patients with cerebrovascular ischemic disease, particularly moyamoya. In addition, its application to complex cerebral aneurysms and neoplasms requiring vessel sacrifice for complete resection continues to stand the test of time. METHODS: We present a detailed, illustrated video demonstration of the procedure. CONCLUSION: With careful attention to the surgical nuances of STA-MCA bypass, this indispensable procedure is a hemisphere-preserving technique that can be performed with high patency and low morbidity rates.
