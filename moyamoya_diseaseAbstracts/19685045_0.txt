BACKGROUND: Renovascular disease is an uncommon but important cause of hypertension in children. When unrecognized and untreated, renovascular hypertension in children can have serious complications. OBJECTIVE: To review the causes of renovascular hypertension and computed tomography angiographic (CTA) findings in children and adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight CTAs from January 2004 to March 2008 of 23 children and adolescents with hypertension were reviewed for the causes and CTA findings. RESULTS: Nine of the 23 children (39%) had abnormal renal arteries with or without abnormal abdominal aortas. Four of these children had Takayasu arteritis, one had moyamoya disease, and one had median arcuate ligament syndrome. One with chronic pyelonephritis had severe stenosis of the proximal right renal artery. The other two children had renal artery stenosis with a nonspecific cause. One child with a normal abdominal aorta and renal arteries had a right suprarenal mass. On pathological examination a ganglioneuroma was found. CONCLUSION: CTA can help in diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in children and adolescents. Although CTA is not a screening modality, it is appropriate in some situations.
