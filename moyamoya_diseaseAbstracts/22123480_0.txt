Three cases of ruptured intracranial aneurysm associated with moyamoya disease are presented. Endovascular treatments were performed successfully in two patients with major artery aneurysms. One patient with a collateral aneurysm was managed conservatively and follow-up angiography 1 year later demonstrated spontaneous disappearance of the aneurysm. Our experience suggests that although aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease show differences in evolution and location, endovascular treatment of major artery aneurysms is safe and effective, and peripheral aneurysms which cannot be directly accessed for surgery or endovascular embolization may be treated conservatively.
