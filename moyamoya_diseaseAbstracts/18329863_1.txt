The aim of this study was to look over the neurological disorders associated with Down syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We reviewed 12 patients with Down syndrome hospitalized from 1997 to 2003, suffering from various neurological complications. RESULTS: Among the 5 patients with epilepsy, 3 presented with West syndrome and 2 with partial epilepsy; after treatment all were seizure-free. Four patients had ischemic lesions; 1 presented with Moya-Moya syndrome. Four patients presented with C1-C2 vertebral dislocation; all underwent surgery. One of the patients with epilepsy had neurological ischemic sequelae. CONCLUSION: West syndrome is the most frequent type of epilepsy encountered in Down syndrome. Outcome is favourable if appropriate treatment is initiated early. Any suspicion or sign of vascular lesion in patients with Down syndrome should be promptly investigated. The hyperlaxity associated with Down syndrome could lead to C1-C2 dislocation and a systematic screening is mandatory in order to avoid neurological complications.
