We report a 1-year-old girl who presented moyamoya disease associated with midaortic syndrome. She had been treated for cardiac failure and severe hypertension due to midaortic syndrome until she suffered seizure and repeated cerebral ischemic attack. Cerebral angiography revealed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery at its terminal portion. She was successfully treated with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, and ischemic attack ceased postoperatively. This is the first report of moyamoya disease with midaortic syndrome. Although cerebral ischemic attack has been effectively managed by encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, renovascular hypertension is still difficult to control.
