Visual disturbances in moyamoya disease are evaluated. Forty-three among our series of 178 cases of moyamoya disease were suffered from various visual symptoms such as visual field defect, attack of blindness, decreased visual acuity, scintillating scotoma. These visual manifestations were resulted from the occlusive lesions in the posterior circulation. In comparison with the cases of adult onset, those of juvenile onset tend to develop visual disturbances. STA-MCA anastomosis with EMS exerts indirect redistribution effect upon the posterior circulation in moyamoya disease. In most cases, improvement in the visual disturbances followed these bypass operations. However, in five cases, omentum transplantation to the occipital lobe as the method of direct revascularization were needed.
