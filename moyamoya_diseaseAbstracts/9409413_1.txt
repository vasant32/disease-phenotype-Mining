To determine the difference in cerebral hemodynamics between Moyamoya disease and atherosclerotic occlusion of the major cerebral arterial trunks, we measured local cerebral blood flow (CBF) and local CO2 reactivity (CO2R) by xenon-enhanced computed tomography (CT). A total of 11 adult patients with Moyamoya disease (mean age, 39.6 +/- 7.8 years) and eight patients with atherosclerotic occlusion of the major arterial trunks (mean age, 62.4 +/- 15.4 years) were studied. Regions of interest were frontal, temporal and occipital cortex, caudate, putamen and thalamus in each hemisphere. In patients with Moyamoya disease, local CBF values in the internal carotid artery territory (frontal and temporal cortex, caudate, putamen) were significantly higher than those in the occluded side of patients with atherosclerotic occlusion. Local CO2R values in the caudate and putamen were significantly higher than those in the occluded side of patients with atherosclerotic occlusion. These results suggest that the cerebral hemodynamics of Moyamoya disease differ from those of atherosclerotic occlusion of the major cerebral arterial trunks, and may be a result of the abundant collateral circulation through basal 'Moyamoya' vessels.
