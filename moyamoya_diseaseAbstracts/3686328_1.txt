We present a case of severe moyamoya disease in a 4-year-old child involving the anterior and posterior circulations. Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was performed and the child was followed for 5 years with serial angiography. Early clinical stabilization was attained and the child has normal or superior intellectual development despite her early fixed deficits. Follow-up angiography revealed the development of several large direct anastomotic channels.
