Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) confirmed a rapid progression of arterial lesion in Moyamoya disease after the patient gave birth. TCD could initially detect a large number of microembolic signals (MES) at the distal portion of stenotic lesions. After MRA showed the development of stenotic lesions 10 days after first TCD monitoring, MES were absent. MES may be related to the clinical activity of Moyamoya disease.
