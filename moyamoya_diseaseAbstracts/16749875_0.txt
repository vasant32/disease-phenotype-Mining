A middle-aged woman was admitted to hospital after a motor vehicle accident. A large acute intracranial haematoma was initially thought to be traumatic in origin, but its unusual position and the lack of external features of head trauma prompted investigation for other causes of intracerebral haemorrhage. Moyamoya intracranial vascular abnormalities were diagnosed. We discuss the presentation of non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage in the setting of presumed trauma, and the unusual conditions of moyamoya syndrome and moyamoya disease.
