The computed tomographic (CT) features in 10 patients with moyamoya disease have been analysed. The scan findings were correlated with the corresponding angiographic profile and the stage of the vascular disease. Multiple infarcts (82%), abnormal enhancement patterns (50%) and cerebral atrophy (60%) were the frequent abnormalities detected. Though the abnormalities on scan did not correlate entirely with the angiographic and the clinical profiles, the CT Scans were most frequently abnormal in later stages of the disease (Stages-4 and 5). No scan abnormalities were detected in the territory of the posterior circulation.
