Numerous surgical techniques have been developed and refined for the treatment of moyamoya disease. Among the indirect techniques of revascularization, encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis has been recognized as effective in promoting revascularization and reversing symptomatology. Neovascularization occurs between the donor artery, either the superficial temporal artery or the occipital artery, and the underlying ischemic cortex. Additionally, the middle meningeal artery and its dural branches have also been shown to contribute to collateral blood supply. In this report the authors describe an integrated management of the meninges for optimal revascularization. They emphasize the importance of recognizing the 3 major layers of the dura and describe a technique of dural splitting at the locus minoris resistentiae between the dura mater's vascular (middle) layer and internal median layer. Applying the dura's vascular layer to the surface of the brain after opening of the arachnoid is designed to optimize dural-pial synangiosis related to middle meningeal artery branches.
