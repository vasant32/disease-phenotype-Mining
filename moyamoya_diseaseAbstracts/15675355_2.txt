Moyamoya disease is a well-known cerebrovascular disorder of unknown pathogenesis affecting terminal portion of internal carotid arteries and causing ischemic attacks. Its familial occurrence suggests genetic background. We hypothesized that paternally imprinted gene might be associated with this disorder. To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3. Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from moyamoya patients. Although these ESTs are clustered on the same 150 kb region, we finally failed to identify cDNA in this region.
