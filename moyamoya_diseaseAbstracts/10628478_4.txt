OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of MR angiography in revealing moyamoya disease before and after encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients (51 hemispheres) with angiographically confirmed moyamoya disease who underwent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis were included in the study. Findings on preoperative MR angiography were compared with those on conventional angiography. Postoperative neurologic status was categorized as poor, fair, good, or excellent. Postoperative MR angiography was examined for the appearance of the superficial temporal artery, changes in moyamoya vessels, and transdural collateral vessels into the middle cerebral artery territory. RESULTS: Preoperative MR angiography revealed moyamoya disease in all patients (diagnostic accuracy, 100%). MR angiography correctly depicted the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis in 37 arteries (73%), moyamoya vessels in 33 hemispheres (65%), and the degree of stenosis in the middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries in 125 (82%) of 153 arteries. After surgery, 39 hemispheres showed an excellent outcome, eight showed a good outcome, two a fair outcome, and two a poor outcome. On postoperative MR angiography, vascular supply to the middle cerebral artery territory via transdural collateral vessels increased in 28 hemispheres (55%) and decreased in four (8%). The size of the superficial temporal artery increased in 41 (80%) of 51 hemispheres. The extent of moyamoya vessels decreased in 27 hemispheres (53%) after surgery. CONCLUSION: MR angiography can show the changes in the superficial temporal artery and development of transdural collateral vessels after encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis. Because MR angiography is noninvasive, it is valuable for evaluating postoperative changes.
