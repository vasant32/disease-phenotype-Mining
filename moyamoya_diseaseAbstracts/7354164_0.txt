A 7-year-old female with computed tomographic evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was subsequently proven by cerebral angiography to have moyamoya disease. The rarity of this manifestation of moyamoya disease and its cause are discussed. In addition to cerebral atrophy and old focal infarctions, the demonstration of tortuous, irregular vessels in the basal ganglia and poor visualization of the proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries should suggest moyamoya disease before cerebral angiography is performed.
