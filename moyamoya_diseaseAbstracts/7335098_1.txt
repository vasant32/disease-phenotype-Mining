A 12 years and 8 months old girl with tuberous sclerosis developed focal motor and sensory seizures and hemiplegias initially right-sided and later left-sided. Cerebral angiography showed bilateral and symmetrical vascular network with teleangiectasias in the region of the basal ganglia and bilateral stenoses and ectasias of the middle cerebral artery. It is discussed whether this is a case of atypical Moyamoya disease or whether the bilateral basal networks are blood vessel dysplasias and part of the neurocutaneous phakomatosis.
