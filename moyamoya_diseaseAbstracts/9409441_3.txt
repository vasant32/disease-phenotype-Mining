We investigated the levels of angiogenic growth factors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with Moyamoya disease and from those with atherosclerotic occlusive disease to evaluate the relationship of these factors to the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease. CSF from Moyamoya patients contained significantly higher concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) (P < 0.05). The b-FGF level was apparently elevated in patients with well developed neovascularization after indirect revascularization surgery (P < 0.01). The other angiogenic factors were not significantly elevated compared with those of the control group.
