Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was determined in man by Xenon-133 intravenous bolus injection technique. This method is of value especially for patients with stroke. The measuring system constituted of a 16 channel cerebrograph (rCBF 1656, Meditronic, Denmark) and a minicomputer (AI Electronics, Japan). Then, for an estimation of rCBF, two compartment analysis was applied in which a special computer program was used for this purpose. Amount of Xenon-133 in expired air was used for calculation, since we confirmed that Xenon-133 clearance in expired air was similar to that in arterial blood except for those patients with obstructive lung disease and so on. In normal adults, rCBF of the gray matter was 67 +/- 13 ml/100 g brain/min. (95% confidence limits). Patients who had been TIA or RIND, revealed a decrease of rCBF of 33--49 ml/100 g brain/min. bilaterally, although they did not show any clinical signs at the time of measurement. Contrariwise, two cases of Moya-moya disease showed a normal value of rCBF at their silent periods.
