A co-operative study was conducted to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with moyamoya disease who were diagnosed and treated at neurosurgical institutes in Korea before 1995. Twenty-six hospitals contributed 505 cases and among them, the clinical characteristics of 334 patients with definite moyamoya disease were evaluated. The number of patients began to increase from the late 1980s, and after that approximately 20 patients were treated each year. There were two age peaks: from six to 15 and from 31 to 40 years of age. Haemorrhagic manifestations occurred in approximately 43% of the patients. The major clinical manifestations were haemorrhage in adults (62.4%) and ischaemia in children (61.2%). Overall 54.5% of the patients experienced decreased consciousness levels, mainly due to intracranial haemorrhage or cerebral infarction. In the patients with ischemic manifestations, the adult patients were more likely to have cerebral infarction than the pediatric patients (80% vs. 39%) and the pediatric patients were more likely to have TIA (61% vs. 25%). Thirty eight percent of the patients underwent bypass surgery and 53% of these procedures were performed bilaterally. Treatment policies, including indications for bypass surgery and commonly used drugs, were somewhat different according to the institution. Overall favorable outcome was 73%, and the most significant factor affecting poor outcome was haemorrhagic manifestation. This article describes the characteristics of 334 patients with moyamoya disease, who were diagnosed and treated at neurosurgical institutes in Korea before 1995.
