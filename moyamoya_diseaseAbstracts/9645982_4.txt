We present the clinical, radiological and autopsy findings in a 32-year-old woman with primary oxalosis, who suffered recurrent bilateral carotid territory infarcts. The overall features were those of moya-moya syndrome, with bilateral, ultimately thrombotic, occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries. Vessel pathology suggests an underlying intimal vasculopathy, the possible relation of which to the patient's metabolic abnormality is discussed.
