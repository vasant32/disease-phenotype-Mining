Unilateral Moyamoya disease presents as unilateral stenosis or obstruction of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, which causes cerebral hypoperfusion resulting in seizures or TIA-like attacks. In severe cases, surgical treatment is performed with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis. In mild cases, conservative management is the treatment of choice. Flunarizine is a calcium ion anti-blocking agent, whose primary effect is that the cerebral vessels have been used for the treatment of postcerebrovascular disorders. Recently, it has been suggested that flunarizine could be used to treat Moyamoya disease. This report documents the efficacy of flunarizine to improve regional cerebral perfusion in Moyamoya disease.
