A case is presented of moyamoya disease in an Anglo-Saxon child whose principal clinical feature, uniquely, was dementia. CT findings were unexplainable so angiography was performed. Moyamoya is an angiographic entity which has been associated with a wide variety of conditions. No satisfactory hypothesis has yet emerged to link these conditions or to explain the predilection of the Japanese for this disease.
