MR angiography (MRA) for pediatric moyamoya disease is important as a non-invasive examination to diagnose blood flow in the brain. Generally, the conventional 3D-TOF MRA is used for moyamoya disease. However, retrobulbar and subcutaneous fat of the head show high intensity signals. We found that using the conventional MRA to diagnose the details of brain blood flow is difficult and that it cannot differentiate moyamoya vessels and fat. It similarly obscures the ophthalmic artery and superficial temporal artery that overlap with fat in the direction of the maximum intensity projection (MIP). Therefore, we devised an MRA technique with fat suppression to diagnose blood flow in moyamoya disease patients: MR angiography with the principle of selective excitation technique (PROSET). The scan time does not need to be increased. We studied the TOF effect in constant and pulsatile flows and the water selective excitation method with the binominal pulse (PROSET) for the fat suppression effect for moyamoya disease. The results showed that PROSET-MRA achieved better image results than conventional MRA. The development of collaterals of the superficial temporal artery and occipital artery in pre- and post-operation moyamoya disease could be clearly visualized and evaluated. The PROSET-MRA method is useful for evaluating pre- and post-operation (encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, encephalo-myo-synangiosis) blood flow reconstruction for patients who have moyamoya disease.
