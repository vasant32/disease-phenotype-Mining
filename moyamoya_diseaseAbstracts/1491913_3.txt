Moyamoya disease is a rare vascular anomaly of the cerebral arteries. The etiology of the disease has not yet been clearly identified. We report the noninvasive diagnosis of Moyamoya disease in a patients with a very early onset of symptoms in infancy. The diagnosis was made by colour coded Doppler sonography and confirmed by angiography at the age of 6 months, following two episodes of cerebral infarction. A bilateral encephalodurosynangiosis was performed at the age of 7 months with subsequent slight improvement of the neurological deficits. Colour Doppler sonography revealed early vascularisation from the fascia temporalis graft into the arachnoid space. At the age of 10 months the patient developed arterial hypertension caused by left renal artery stenosis. Our case suggests, that in infancy Moyamoya disease can be suspected noninvasively by colour Doppler sonography of the cerebral arteries. Patients should be carefully screened for possible extracranial arterial stenoses which may develop in the course of time. Encephalodurosynangiosis seems to be a good therapeutic option for patients with severe neurological symptoms.
