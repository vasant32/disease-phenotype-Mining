BACKGROUND: To investigate whether nitric oxide (NO) contributes to formation of abnormal collateral circulation in patients with moyamoya disease. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained from the subarachnoid space of the Sylvian fissure during combined bypass surgery for moyamoya disease and kept frozen until NO metabolites, nitrate and nitrite, were measured using a Griess method. RESULTS: Compared with control CSF obtained from 18 patients with hemifacial spasm, unruptured aneurysm, etc., concentrations of NO metabolites in 26 CSF samples of 18 patients with moyamoya disease were significantly higher (mean +/- SE; 17.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 10.5 +/- 1.0 microM, p < 0.01). In eight patients, the CSF samples from both the first and second operation could be obtained. NO metabolite concentrations (20.5 +/- 2.3 microM) in CSF obtained from the first surgery decreased to 15.7 +/- 1.8 microM (p < 0.01) in CSF obtained from the second, contralateral procedure. The cases of moyamoya disease with greater development of moyamoya vessels at angiographic stage 3 and 4 tended to show higher concentrations of NO metabolites than cases at earlier or later stages with a few moyamoya vessels. INTERPRETATION: Nitric oxide concentrations in CSF are chronically elevated in moyamoya disease, probably reflecting development of abnormal collateral circulation. i.e. moyamoya vessels. Vascular bypass surgery can reduce abnormal collateral circulation with reduced production of nitric oxide.
