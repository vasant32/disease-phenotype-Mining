 BACKGROUND: The best revascularization strategy for moyamoya disease (MMD) remains unknown. Our aim was to characterize angiographic revascularization effects of a bilateral standardized revascularization approach, consisting of superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass and encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) on one hemisphere and single EMS on the contralateral hemisphere of each patient, and to compare the effects of both revascularization strategies on cerebral hemodynamics. METHODS: In 30 patients (18 females/12 males, age 8-63 years), standardized revascularization was performed. Digital subtraction angiography was performed preoperatively and at 7 days, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. STA-MCA and EMS functions were graded I (poor), II (medium) or III (extensive) according to angiographic aspects. In 20 patients, cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) was assessed pre- and postoperatively (at 12 months) using xenon CT. RESULTS: After 12 months, STA-MCA/EMS function was grade 1 in 40/40%, grade 2 in 27/26%, and grade 3 in 27/10% of hemispheres, respectively. Twelve months after surgery, single EMS showed grade I in 37%, grade II in 27%, and grade III in 20% of hemispheres. Combined revascularization improved CVRC significantly compared to preoperative measurement (preoperative: 16.5 ± 34.6% vs. postoperative: 60.8 ± 64.22%; p < 0.05). Single EMS did not improve CVRC significantly (preoperative: 21.8 ± 35.9% vs. postoperative: 34.8 ± 63.0%; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combined and indirect revascularization may be successfully applied in a bilateral standardized approach. STA-MCA/EMS is superior to single EMS in restoring CVRC in adult MMD patients.
