OBJECTIVE: To monitor patency of the bypass and to accomplish comprehensive visualized evaluation of brain surface hemodynamics in childhood moyamoya patients, we performed intraoperative monitoring using novel infrared imaging system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intraoperative monitoring of brain surface blood flow by IRIS V infrared imaging system has been conducted during superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis on seven sides of five pediatric patients with moyamoya disease (man/woman = 2:3, 7-8 years old). The range of recipient artery was 0.7-0.8 mm (average 0.75 mm). Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were performed routinely before and after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In all cases, patency of bypass, as well as detailed local hemodynamics and changes of brain surface temperature distribution could be evaluated. Intraoperative infrared system will be a feasible monitoring not only for noninvasive intraoperative evaluation of bypass patency but also for local hemodynamics even in patients with childhood moyamoya disease.
