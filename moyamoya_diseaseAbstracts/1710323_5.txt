The authors report a case of moyamoya disease accompanied by arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Angiography demonstrated typical moyamoya vessels on the right and early changes of moyamoya disease on the left. A small AVM in the left frontal lobe supplied by a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was also revealed. The AVM was surgically resected simultaneously with contralateral encephaloaponeurotic synangiosis for the moyamoya vessels. One month after surgery, left MCA occlusion at the origin occurred probably due to hemodynamic changes after the resection of the AVM.
