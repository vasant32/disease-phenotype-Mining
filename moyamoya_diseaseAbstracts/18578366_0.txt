It has already been proved by many studies that surgical revascularization definitely helps in curing the symptoms of moyamoya vasculopathy. In this regard, we present a case of moyamoya disease which was cured by concurrent multiple anastomotic procedures, namely superficial temporal artery (STA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis, encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) and encephalogaleosynangiosis (EGS). A 24-year-old woman presented with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Thorough investigation with MRA and MRI revealed moyamoya vasculopathy and was confirmed by cerebral angiogram. Multiple concurrent combined anastomotic procedures on both sides relieved the symptoms, which was also confirmed angiographically. A Combination of multiple direct and indirect procedures covers the whole ischemic cortical area and provides effective neovascularization.
