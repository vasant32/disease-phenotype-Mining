A total of 13 cases of Moyamoya disease were verified by internal and external carotid artery angiography. The biopsy samples were taken from the superficial temporal arteries and middle meningeal arteries in 12 and six cases, respectively. Angiographical and histological studies revealed that both of the internal and external carotid system could be involved in Moyamoya disease. Our studies demonstrated that Moyamoya disease was a type of vascular disease not only confined to the cerebral vessels. We recommend angiography of external carotid system and extracranial segment of internal carotid artery while performing three vascular angiography. Whether superficial temporal artery has been involved in angiography can be used as an indication of indirect cerebrovascular bypass.
