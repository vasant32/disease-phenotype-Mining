A case of moyamoya disease associated with multiple intracranial aneurysms is reported. The aneurysms were located at the bifurcation of the basilar artery and at the precommunicating segment of the right posterior-cerebral artery. They were found to be unruptured and clipped successfully through a right frontotemporal craniotomy. Outcome of the operation was satisfactory. We propose the operative indication for these cases on the basis of operative and radiological findings, and also discuss characteristic aspects of this disease.
