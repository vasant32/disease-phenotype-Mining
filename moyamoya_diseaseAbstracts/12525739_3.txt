The authors present a case of hyperventilation-induced left upper limb shaking from an underlying Moyamoya disease. Video EEG monitoring and SPECT study were performed. Leptomeningeal collateral circulation was investigated by conventional angiography and by SPECT study with acetazolamide. Limb shaking in Moyamoya disease may result from a transient hypoperfusion of the contralateral frontoparietal cortex rather than basal ganglia.
