Three patients are reported with the rare combination of moyamoya disease and features of an associated arteriovenous malformation. Two of the patients developed ischemic symptoms, and the third patient presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage. All three patients fit the criteria of a stage III moyamoya syndrome on the basis of the angiographic classification described by Suzuki and Takaku. The patients were referred to this medical center following angiography with the presumptive diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation.
