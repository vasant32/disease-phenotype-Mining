We report a case of characteristic relapsing ischaemic moyamoya disease in a 40-year-old woman. Under polytherapy when she was in a life-threatening condition we observed a prompt, dramatic improvement. Since diagnosis was late a permanent defect could not be prevented. Since corticosteroid medication has been reported as ineffective in the literature and haemodilution and pentoxyfylline seem to be of dubious benefit, we ascribe the dramatic improvement to the calcium antagonist nimodipine. The progress made is in our view equal to the progress made after revascularizing operations. Without a comparable risk, there is hope for treatment that can be initiated earlier in the development of the disease.
