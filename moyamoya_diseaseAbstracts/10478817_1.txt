Myocardial infarction is very rare in young female patients with systemic vascular disorders. Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disease associated with an abnormal vascular network. This report presents a 19-year-old female patient who suffered from chest pain and exertional dyspnea for 2 months prior to admission. She had a history of Moyamoya disease and pituitary gigantism since childhood. Her ejection fraction on echocardiogram was 20% and a perfusion defect with partial reversibility in the anterior wall was demonstrated on stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Diagnostic coronary angiogram revealed critical stenosis in the middle left anterior descending artery, which was treated by coronary stenting. Her subjective symptoms were relieved and the perfusion defect seen on SPECT decreased after coronary intervention.
