OBJECTIVE: The extracranial involvement of moyamoya disease has been reported in several studies. The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of stenoocclusive lesions in the renal and major abdominal arteries in moyamoya disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal angiography was performed in 73 patients with idiopathic moyamoya disease. The findings of abdominal angiography were retrospectively reviewed for the presence and appearance of stenosis in the renal and other major abdominal arteries. RESULTS: Four (5%) of 73 patients presented with unilateral renal artery stenosis. Three patients had moderate stenosis, and one patient had mild stenosis. In the three patients with moderate stenosis, the renal artery stenosis was located in the proximal region of the main branch. Two patients (3%) with moderate stenosis of the unilateral renal artery had renovascular hypertension. No statistically significant differences were observed in age, sex, and the cerebral angiographic stage between patients with and without renal artery stenosis. No stenosis was found in the abdominal aorta or celiac, superior mesenteric, common hepatic, splenic, and proximal common iliac arteries. No occlusions were found in any abdominal arteries. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in patients with moyamoya disease was 5% (4/73). Involvement of the proximal region of the renal artery was dominant. No stenosis was found in other abdominal arteries.
