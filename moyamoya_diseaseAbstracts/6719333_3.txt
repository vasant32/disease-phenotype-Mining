A case of coexisting moyamoya disease and craniopharyngioma in an 8-year-old boy is reported. The patient had been suffering from recurrence of transient right hemiparesis with headache and vomiting during the three years before admission. After the diagnosis of both moyamoya disease and craniopharyngioma, evacuation of the cystic fluid of the craniopharyngioma, encephalomyosynangiosis , and internal irradiation through an Ommaya drainage system were carried out. The symptoms gradually improved after these procedures. The relation of moyamoya disease to craniopharyngioma is discussed. We consider that internal irradiation is one of the best means of treatment for a cystic craniopharyngioma associated with moyamoya disease.
