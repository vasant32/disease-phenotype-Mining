Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches. Direct and indirect bypass techniques have been devised with the aim of promoting neoangiogenesis. The current study aimed to investigate the role of multiple cranial burr hole (MCBH) operations in the prevention of cerebral ischemic attacks in children with MMD. Seven children suffering from progressive MMD were submitted to the MCBH and arachnoid opening technique. Ten to 20 burr holes were drilled in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital area of each hemisphere in each patient, depending on the site and extent of the disease. All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively by means of Barthel index (BI), CT, MR, angio-MR, and angiography. Patients had no recurrence of ischemic attacks postoperatively. Neoangiogenesis was observed in both hemispheres. One patient developed a persistent subdural collection after surgery, thus requiring placement of a subdural-peritoneal shunt. Postoperative BI was statistically significantly improved (P=0.02). This report suggests that MCBH for revascularization in MMD is a simple procedure with a relatively low risk of complications and effective for preventing cerebral ischemic attacks in children. In addition, MCBH may be placed as an adjunct to other treatments for MMD.
