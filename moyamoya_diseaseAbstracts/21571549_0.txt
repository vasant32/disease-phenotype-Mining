A 52-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with right thalamic hemorrhage. A carotid angiogram revealed occlusion of the terminal portions of the bilateral internal carotid arteries with basal moyamoya vessels, which was diagnosed as moyamoya disease (MMD). At 31 years of age, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis because of optic neuritis and myelitis. Paraplegia appeared 14 days after admission. T2-weighted thoracic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high intensity lesion extending from T4 to T6. Her left upper limb was partially paralytic and her lower limbs exhibited paraplegia and dysesthesia. Anti-aquaporin 4 and anti-Sj√∂gren's syndrome-A and -B antibodies were positive. The pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica may be associated with such immunologic factors, but there are no reports of simultaneous presentations of neuromyelitis optica and MMD. Autoimmunity may be associated with the etiology of MMD.
