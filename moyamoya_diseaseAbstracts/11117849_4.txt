The authors present the case of a 37-year-old man with definite moyamoya disease in whom angiographic findings drastically changed. The patient presented with left hemiparesis due to lacunar infarction. Angiography initially disclosed a narrow right carotid artery (CA) siphon and severe stenosis of the horizontal segment of the left middle cerebral artery. Four years later, the patient experienced right-central facial paresis, which developed because of a small putaminal hematoma. Angiography results demonstrated occlusion of the internal CA siphons bilaterally, with moyamoya vessels. It therefore appears that in some adults, moyamoya disease is accompanied by very progressive vascular changes.
