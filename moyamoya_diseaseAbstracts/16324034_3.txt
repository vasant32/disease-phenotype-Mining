Moyamoya disease is a condition that results from bilateral stenosis or obstruction of the intracranial arteries at the base of the brain. Patients exhibit ischemic symptoms, and vascular reconstruction is the therapy of choice. Surgical treatment for Moyamoya disease is often complicated by cerebral ischemia, so the goal in perioperative management is to maintain the balance between oxygen supply and demand in the brain. This report presents three cases of Moyamoya disease in patients under 3 years of age, and discusses anesthesia management issues for pediatric patients with this condition.
