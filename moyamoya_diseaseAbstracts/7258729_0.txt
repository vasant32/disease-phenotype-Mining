Platelet aggregation was studied by giving ADP or adrenalin to 28 patients with Moyamoya disease. There were 7 males and 21 females, and 27 normal controls, 11 males and 16 females. We found that 2 muM of ADP, and 9.1 and 22.7 muM of adrenalin induced statistically significant increases in nondissociative patterns of platelet aggregation in the patient group. Maximum aggregation was significantly increased in the patient group compared with the controls by the addition of ADP (2 and 4 muM) or adrenalin (9.1 and 22.7 muM). When patients were divided into two groups under and over 20 years of age, there was no discernible difference of platelet aggregation in either group.
