The recent introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanners has enabled high-resolution 3-dimensional reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to establish a method to evaluate moyamoya disease using computed tomography angiography (CTA), specifically MDCT. Twenty-four patients (48 sides total) with moyamoya disease diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were evaluated by means of CTA using MDCT by 3 independent observers, and the resulting 144 sides were analyzed. CTA and MRA were compared in terms of the steno-occlusive changes exhibited in each vessel. CTA and MRA scores were assigned on the basis of the severity of occlusive changes in the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery. CTA scores were significantly correlated with MRA scores (P < .0001), and the 2 scores were in complete agreement in 57 sides (39.6%). The mean CTA score was significantly lower than the mean MRA score (P < .0001). Compared with CTA, MRA overestimated occlusion in 115 of the 576 vessels assessed. The mean MRA score was significantly higher in the overestimation group than in the good correlation group (P < .0001). CTA had a significantly higher rate of detection of moyamoya-affected vessels (P = .0001). Our data indicate that CTA using MDCT is a more reliable technique than MRA for diagnosing moyamoya disease. The ability to perform CTA quickly is a significant benefit for patients with moyamoya disease, particularly in pediatric and emergency cases.
