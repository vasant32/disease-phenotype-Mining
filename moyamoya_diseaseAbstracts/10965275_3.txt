We performed combined indirect surgical procedures using encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis and a burr-hole method according to descriptions by Suzuki et al. and Kawaguchi et al. with some modifications in a 4-year-old child with moyamoya disease. Transient ischemic attacks on both sides completely disappeared within 1 month and never occurred during 2.5 years follow-up period. This surgical procedure may have enough value as the first operation to prevent ischemic damage in the territories of both the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery in children with moyamoya disease.
