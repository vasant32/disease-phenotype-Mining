Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology in which terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries become steno-occlusive, with fine collateral "moyamoya vessels" formed secondarily, resulting in serial ischemic strokes throughout its clinical course. Whole-brain histogram (WBH) of diffusion tensor imaging (WBH-DTI) is an analytical tool whose feasibility has been ascertained in various pathologies. To elucidate whether WBH-DTI could detect any difference between ischemic MMD and normal controls, we examined 27 consecutive MMD patients without hemorrhage and 48 normal controls in this prospective study using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance scanner. WBHs of fractional anisotropy (FA) (WBH-FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (WBH-MD) were compared among three groups: Group 1, MMD patients with infarct (n=15); Group 2, MMD patients without infarct (n=12); and Group 3, normal controls (n=48). Group 1 showed significantly higher peak height and significantly lower mean value on WBH-FA, as well as significantly lower peak height and significantly higher mean value on WBH-MD, compared with Groups 2 and 3. No significant difference was seen in parameters at either WBH-FA or WBH-MD between Groups 2 and 3. These results might reflect the pathological severity of each group, and WBH-DTI could feasibly detect differences between ischemic MMD with infarction and MMD without infarction and normal controls.
