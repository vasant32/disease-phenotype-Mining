Eighteen patients with moyamoya disease were examined by computed tomography (CT). At the first examination, CT findings were normal in one patient and abnormal in 17 patients. Significant abnormalities on precontrast CT were characterized by low density lesions in 14, ventricular dilatation in 9, and cerebral atrophy in 11 patients. Postcontrast CT showed the presence of contrast enhanced lesions in three patients. Follow-up examinations were performed in 13 patients, and the following changes on CT were found in 10 of them: increase or development of low density lesions in 10, ventricular dilatation in 4, cerebral atrophy in 5, appearance of a contrast enhanced lesion in 1, and disappearance of the enhanced lesion in 3. The patient with normal findings at the first examination showed a low density lesion on the second examination. The abnormal vascular networks in the region of the basal ganglia were visualized successfully in six examinations of five patients by higher concentration of contrast medium in blood than usual. Abnormal CT findings consisted of those seen in multiple cerebral infarctions and the visualization of the abnormal vascular networks. Computed tomographic findings on these patients showed evolution as seen in clinical and angiographic findings.
