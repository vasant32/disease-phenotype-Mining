A case of ischemic infarction in a young woman who also had angiographic findings consistent with "Moya Moya" disease is presented. Unusual features of the case, such as the presentation as an infarction rather than subarachnoid hemorrhage and the unilaterality of the angiographic abnormalities, are discussed. The literature is reviewed and emphasis is directed to the importance of the inclusion of this entity in the differential diagnosis of cerebral ischemic events in young adults, owing to the possible therapeutic implications.
