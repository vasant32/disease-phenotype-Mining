In the present study the pathology and treatment of occlusion of cerebral arteries in children were investigated in an attempt to find out an approach to the surgical treatment of cerebral arterial occlusive disease of childhood. We had a total of 55 children with cerebrovascular disorders seen at our Institute during the past 11 years. In this series there were 19 cases of cerebral arterial occlusive disease. The causes in 15 cases of cerebral arterial occlusive disease except for moyamoya disease were heart disease in 7 cases, trauma in 2 cases and unknown in 6 cases. The cerebral arterial occlusive disease had its onset at the age of less than 6 years in 12 of 15 cases. The disease began with hemiplegia of sudden onset. The disease onset was also attended frequently by a convulsive seizure, which distinguishes the condition from that in adults. In 10 of all 15 lesions the site of occlusion was in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. One case in which there was occlusion of the basilar artery occurring in association with trauma was described in detail. In one instance the treatment consisted of STA-MCA anastomosis. Paroxysmal black out attacks, which had been of frequent occurrence in addition to hemiplegia were relieved postoperatively. In our opinion, STA-MCA anastomosis for cerebral arterial occlusive disease in children should be considered to be indicated only when 1) cerebral angiographic evidence of occlusion or stenosis of a trunk of cerebral artery is still present after the acute stage or 2) no extensive low density area is demonstrable on CT scan. Surgery is generally less indicated in those instances in which the occlusion is due to embolism. However since abscess may arise from such an arterial lesion, surgery should be considered, or at least its feasibility be evaluated, whenever 1) the underlying cardiac pathology well permits surgical intervention and 2) half a year has passed since an initial attack.
