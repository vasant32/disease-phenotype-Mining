51 times (sides) of reconstructive surgery using 28 patients with moyamoya diseases were evaluated concerning operative methods, outcome and postoperative angiographic findings. Twenty patients (72%) showed excellent results, 7 patients (25%) good and 1 patient (3%) poor. Development of collaterals shown on postoperative angiograms was excellent on 20 sides, good on 9 sides, and fair on 8. Abundant neovascularization was most commonly noted on angiogram in superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass with encephalo-myo-synangiosis. Encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis, devised by the authors, or encephalo-myo-synangiosis alone also produced preferable development of collaterals shown on angiogram. Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass alone was insufficient for development of neovascularization.
