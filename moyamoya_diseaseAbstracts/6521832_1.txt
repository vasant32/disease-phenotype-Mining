The authors report a case of moyamoya disease associated with a peripheral artery aneurysm in the thalamus of a 54-year-old woman. Plain CT scans revealed the right thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular penetration. Cerebral angiography demonstrated the characteristic appearance of moyamoya disease with a peripheral artery aneurysm in the territory of the right medial posterior choroidal artery. This aneurysm ruptured three times during 8 days since onset and the thalamic hemorrhage became larger on each occasion. Although the clinical symptoms and signs and plain CT scans disclosed thalamic hemorrhage, it was difficult to explain the cause of the hemorrhage. The authors emphasize that cerebral angiography and enhanced CT scans are quite necessary to clarify the genesis of cerebrovascular disease.
