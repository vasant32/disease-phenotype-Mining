OBJECTIVE: We assessed the value of a new magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique named hybrid of opposite-contrast (HOP) MRA in the diagnosis of moyamoya disease. METHODS: Using a dual-echo sequence, we obtained the first echo for time-of-flight (TOF) MRA followed by the second echo for black blood MRA. We then subtracted the black blood MRA data set from that of the TOF MRA followed by maximum-intensity projection. In 14 patients, we performed HOP MRA and compared the findings with those on 3-dimensional TOF MRA and MR images. The HOP MRA was also compared with a radionuclide perfusion study (7 patients). RESULTS: The HOP MRA technique improved the demonstration of distal arteries in 13 patients. The findings in HOP MRA correlated with MR images in 9 patients as well as with the perfusion study in 6 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The HOP MRA technique demonstrated the distal arterial branches in moyamoya disease well and facilitated the perfusion assessment with MR imaging.
