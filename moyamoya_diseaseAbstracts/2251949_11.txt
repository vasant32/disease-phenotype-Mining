Encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) was done in 16 Japanese children with Moyamoya disease on 22 sides. The results were evaluated clinically, angiographically, and by positron emission computed tomography (PET). Postoperative external carotid angiograms showed a good collateral circulation through EDAS in 72 percent of the treated sides. Two-thirds of the sides examined by PET showed improvement in cerebral blood circulation, particularly at the surgically-treated cortex. Postoperatively the symptoms disappeared in those with good new collateral formation. TIA, RIND, and/or involuntary movement disappeared in 31 percent and partially so in 44 percent 6 months after EDAS. The TIA in the lower limb and/or involuntary movement persisted in some children. This surgical approach seems applicable particularly for children with the ischaemic type of Moyamoya disease, however, the procedure also has drawbacks. Development of collateral circulation was insufficient in some cases, and the territories of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or posterior cerebral artery (PCA) were often not covered, even in those with a good new collateral formation in the middle cerebral arterial (MCA) area.
