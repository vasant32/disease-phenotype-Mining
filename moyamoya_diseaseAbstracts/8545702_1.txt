Moyamoya disease, or idiopathic progressive arteriopathy, is a vascular occlusive disease that results in stenosis of the internal carotid arteries, stimulating the development of collaterals and telangiectatic vasculature from basilar and leptomeningeal arteries. Within the past several years, several reports have suggested that children with Down syndrome can develop moyamoya vasculopathy. We present the first reported magnetic resonance angiographic diagnosis of moyamoya disease in an adult with Down syndrome. This was also confirmed by conventional cerebral angiography.
