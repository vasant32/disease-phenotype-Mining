OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of pediatric cerebrovascular disorders. METHODS: The clinical data of 204 cases of pediatric cerebrovascular disease, 134 male and 70 female (1.91: 1), aged 12.7 (32 d - 17.9 years), hospitalized in the past 13 years were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage was mainly based on CT, Digital subtraction angiography was conducted on 130 cases and pathological examination was conducted on 78 cases. RESULTS: Intracranial hemorrhage was seen in 195 cases. The onset of symptoms was acute or subacute in 73.5% of the patients (150/204). The main manifestations included headache (70.6%), vomiting (50%), loss of consciousness (22.5%), convulsion (21.6%), and focal neurological deficits (13.2%). The causes included arteriovenous malformation (42.2%, 86/204), cavernoma (16.2%, 33/204), aneurysm (8.8%, 18/204), and moyamoya disease (5.9%, 12/204), and the cause remained unknown in 43 of the patients (21%). CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of pediatric cerebrovascular diseases has its own specificity. Therefore, it is crucial to deal timely with it according to the characteristics of the cerebrovascular diseases in children's.
