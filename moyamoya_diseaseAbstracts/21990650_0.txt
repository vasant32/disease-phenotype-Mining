Occasionally an aneurysm is the cause of hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). We present a case of a ruptured intraventricular distal anterior choroidal artery (AChA) aneurysm treated with n-butyl cyanoacrylic acid (nBCA) (Trufill nBCA Liquid Embolic, Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, Massachusetts, USA) embolization in a patient with MMD. There were no procedural complications and at 6 month follow-up she remained neurologically normal. Six month follow-up cerebral angiography showed no residual aneurysm. The endovascular route is an attractive option for many aneurysms associated with MMD as the lesions can be treated without disturbing the moyamoya collaterals. nBCA, delivered through a flow-guided microcatheter, is a good embolic agent choice when the lesion is distal on a small vessel and when distal parent artery occlusion can be tolerated. Intraventricular AChA aneurysms are well suited for this treatment strategy.
