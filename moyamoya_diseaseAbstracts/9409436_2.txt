The efficacy of bypass surgery for the patients with hemorrhagic Moyamoya disease were studied by multi-center retrospective questionnaire study. The rebleeding rate was 28.3% (39/138 patients) in conservative treatment group and 19.1% (29/152 patients) in bypass surgery group with no significant statistical difference. It is still difficult to clarify the efficacy of bypass surgery for prevention of hemorrhagic attack.
