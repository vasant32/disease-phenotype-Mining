As a leading cause of death and disability in patients across the world, stroke is a problem that plagues both neurosurgeons and neurologists alike. Whether a result of atherosclerosis, moyamoya disease, or a complication in the treatment of a complex intracranial aneurysm, cerebrovascular occlusion can have devastating effects on patients. For nearly half a century neurosurgeons have searched for safer, more effective ways to increase the amount of blood flow to ischemic brain tissue. From the first extracranial-intracranial bypasses to the recent technological advancements seen with endovascular therapy, cerebral revascularization techniques have been constantly evolving. Over the years cerebral ischemia has gone from a condition that was previously considered surgically untreatable, to a condition with several viable options for prevention and treatment. In this paper the authors discuss the historical evolution of treatment for cerebrovascular occlusive disease.
