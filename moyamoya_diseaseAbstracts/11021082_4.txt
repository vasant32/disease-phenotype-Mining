A 24-year-old female presented with Terson syndrome secondary to bilateral ventricular hemorrhage as a complication of moyamoya disease. Ophthalmoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging clearly demonstrated vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye globe. Various visual symptoms are associated with moyamoya disease, almost all of which result from ischemic lesions in the visual cortex and optic pathways. In this case, the visual disturbance was caused by Terson syndrome secondary to ventricular hemorrhage. Close ophthalmological and radiological evaluation is mandatory even in patients with moyamoya disease and hemorrhagic manifestation located in the intracerebral, subarachnoid, or intraventricular space.
