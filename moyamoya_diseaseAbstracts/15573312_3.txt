INTRODUCTION: Ischemic vascular pathologies are predominant among the neurological processes associated to Down syndrome. Thrombosis of the venous sinuses, Moya-moya syndrome and arterial dysplasia, among others, stand out for their association with this syndrome. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 19-year-old female patient suffering from Down syndrome who visited because of deficiency symptoms of an ischemic origin; diagnosis was based on angiographic disorders compatible with Moya-moya syndrome in the left carotid tree and arterial dysplasia in the right carotid tree. Data concerning the medical history, physical examination, complementary tests, treatment applied and evaluation of the patient's clinical progress are reported. At the same time, the patient was also diagnosed as suffering from Graves-Basedow disease, which is contemplated in the aetiological study carried out on these and other vascular anomalies and which have often been described in relation to Down syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The particular interest of our case lies in the fact that the two pathological processes occur in the same patient, although only one of them was symptomatic. Both of these vascular anomalies have been described in association with Down syndrome separately, but the simultaneous presence of both of them in the same patient is infrequent. We suggest the possibility of a common aetiological link between the two processes, which in turn accounts for their association with Down syndrome.
