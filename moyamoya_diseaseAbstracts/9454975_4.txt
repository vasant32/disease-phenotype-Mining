Two cases of moyamoya disease observed in two children are reported. The two cases recall the frequency of ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and seizures revealing the disease. Diagnosis is made by cerebral arteriography showing carotid stenosis and the dense deep arterial collateral as seen in these two cases. Magnetic resonance imaging makes it possible to identify this vascular disease as it reveals vascular varicosities in the basal ganglia, as in case 1. Strokes can sometimes be prevented by constructing an anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery, as demonstrated in case 1. Thus, the diagnosis of moyamoya disease has been improved by magnetic resonance imaging and there is now a surgical treatment to prevent ischemic stroke.
