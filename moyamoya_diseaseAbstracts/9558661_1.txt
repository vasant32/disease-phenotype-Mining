A recurrent craniopharyngioma associated with moyamoya vessels was successfully treated by partial removal of the tumor via the transsphenoidal approach followed by gamma-knife radiosurgery. This 19-year-old man was first treated by partial tumor removal and radiotherapy (54Gy) at the age of 6 years. Growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin were given from the ages of 13 to 18 years. At ag 17 years, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed regrowth of the tumor. At the age of 19 years, he was readmitted for treatment of the enlarging remnant tumor. Neurological examination revealed bilateral blindness. MRI showed marked suprasellar, sphenoidal and bilateral cavernous sinus extension of the tumor. Angiography revealed stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and the M1 and A1 segments of the right cerebral arteries, as well as occlusion of the C3 segment of the left internal carotid artery. There were vault and ethmoidal moyamoya vessels. The patient underwent tumor removal via the transsphenoidal approach, instead of craniotomy, to avoid injury to the transdural anastomosis. The intrasellar solid tumor was partially removed. The tumor was then irradiated by the gamma knife. MRI 15 months after the treatment showed marked reduction of the tumor. The pathogenesis of the moyamoya phenomenon and the choice of the treatment in this patient are discussed.
