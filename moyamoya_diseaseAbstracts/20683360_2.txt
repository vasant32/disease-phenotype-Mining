The balance between heat production (metabolism) and heat removal (blood flow) helps in keeping the temperature of the brain constant. In patients with moyamoya disease, this balance may be disturbed. The purpose of this study was to assess the thermal pathophysiology of the brain in patients with moyamoya disease. The study included 12 consecutive patients with moyamoya disease and 10 controls. Temperature was measured by image postprocessing of diffusion-weighted images. Our noninvasive thermometry showed that the ventricular temperature of moyamoya disease patients was higher than that of normal controls. The mean temperature difference of 1.1 degrees C between the two groups was significant. Patients with moyamoya disease tend to have elevated ventricular temperatures, which may represent a mismatch between cerebral metabolism and perfusion.
