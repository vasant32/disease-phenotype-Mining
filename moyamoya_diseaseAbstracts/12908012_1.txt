In this study, we investigated the relationship between intimal thickening of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and immunological reaction, and between occlusion of the ICA and development of basal collateral vessels in moyamoya disease. Rod-shaped lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (LGA-50) and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide: MDP), and immuno-embolic material, were injected into cats unilaterally via the common carotid artery. Histological changes of duplication of the internal elastic lamina could be seen mainly in the terminal portion of the ICA in the animals injected with rod-shaped LGA-50 containing MDP. No angiographic changes were seen in any of the animals. These findings suggest that the immunological reaction induced by MDP caused histological changes in the intima of the ICA similar to those observed in moyamoya disease. This experimental study, however, could not clarify the development of the basal collateral vessels.
