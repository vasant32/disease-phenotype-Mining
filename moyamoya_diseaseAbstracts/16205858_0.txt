There are a large variety of non-atherosclerotic causes of ischemic stroke in the young. Arterial dissection, most commonly associated with non-traumatic causes, is among the most common. Both the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations can be affected. The vasculitidies represent a rare, but potentially treatable series of conditions that can lead to stroke through diverse mechanisms. Moyamoya is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory, nonamyloid vasculopathy characterized by chronic progressive stenosis or occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries and/or proximal portions of the middle and/or anterior cerebral arteries. Moyamoya can be idiopathic (moyamoya disease) or the result of other conditions. An appreciation of the unusual causes of stroke in the young is important when considering secondary prevention measures.
