A 60-year-old female and a 40-year-old male underwent surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease and suffered small infarction in the ipsilateral frontal lobe 3 or 4 days postoperatively. Neuroimaging suggested that the bypass flow had caused rapid progression of occlusive changes in the carotid forks, a diminishing of moyamoya vessels, and flow reduction in the anterior cerebral artery ipsilateral to surgery, leading to critical ischemia in the frontal lobe. Surgical revascularization improves the outcome of patients with moyamoya disease, but postoperative management such as hydration is important to avoid ischemic complications due to frontal lobe infarction.
