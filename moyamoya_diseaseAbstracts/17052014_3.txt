Surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease prevents cerebral ischemic attacks by improving CBF. But little is known about the changes of intraoperative cerebral hemodynamics and its effect on postoperative neurological status including symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion. To address this issue, we applied a novel infrared camera system (IRIS-V thermographic system) for real-time, visual monitoring of surface CBF during surgery in patients with moyamoya disease. Seven patients (8 sides, male:female= 3:4, 7-62 years old) with moyamoya disease were included in the study. After STA-MCA anastomosis, STA were occluded transiently and recanalized, and whole sequence was recorded by IRIS-V system. Correlation between clinical, radiological findings and infrared imaging were investigated. Patency of bypass was confirmed by this camera during surgery in all cases. The intraoperative imaging patterns were divided into two groups. Group A: Change of brain surface color (++) (3 cases). Group B: Change of brain surface color (-) (4 cases). Transient symptomatic hyperperfusion occurred in all patients in Group A, whereas all patients in Group B showed non-symptomatic transient focal hyperperfusion on SPECT. No patient suffered permanent neurological deterioration compared to preoperative status. Characteristic pattern of the intraoperative cerebral hemodynamics as delineated by IRIS-V could be the optimal predictor for postoperative transient symptomatic hyperperfusion after direct bypass in patients with moyamoya disease.
