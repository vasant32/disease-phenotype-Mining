BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that excellent development of collateral circulation can be achieved through indirect nonanastomotic bypass procedures for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease. However, there are no definitive conclusions about the effect of indirect revascularization for adult patients. To clarify the value of indirect bypass surgery for adult moyamoya disease, we have analyzed their follow-up angiographic results in comparison with those of the pediatric patients. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1993, 23 patients underwent combined direct and indirect bypass surgery. They consisted of 16 adults (mean age, 35; range, 20-59) and seven children (mean age, 10; range, 3-16). The main symptoms were those due to cerebral ischemia in all but 1 of 23 patients. Preoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed all patients to have decreased vascular reserve (misery perfusion). Postoperative follow-up angiography was done in all patients at a median of 6 months after the surgery. RESULTS: All pediatric patients showed good or moderate development of collaterals through the indirect bypass. Among the adult group, seven patients aged 20 to 29 had angiographic results similar to those of the pediatric group . On the other hand, nine patients older than 30 had results contrary to those of pediatric patients: (1) the degree of indirect revascularization declined to moderate or poor grades (especially in patients older than 40) and (2) the degree of direct bypass filling improved to high or medium grades. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that advancing age apparently affects the development of collateral formation through the indirect bypass. Consequently, direct bypass is thought to be the main treatment option for patients older than 40.
