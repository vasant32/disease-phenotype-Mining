Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed in 13 patients with moyamoya disease was reviewed and compared with computed tomography (CT) and angiography. The MR findings consisted of occlusion of arteries, collateral vessels and parenchymal changes. Narrowing or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery were seen in all hemispheres but one. Collateral vessels, cerebral infarcts and atrophy with dilatation of the ventricles were observed on MR imaging. In general, the MR findings correlated well with angiography regarding occlusive changes and moyamoya vessels but was less sensitive in a few cases. Because of its higher sensitivity in detecting occlusive changes and collateral vessels, MR imaging was superior to CT in the diagnosis of this disease.
