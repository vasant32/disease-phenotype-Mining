To investigate the clinical features and surgical outcome of pediatric cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we retrospectively reviewed 280 children (up to 15 years of age) who underwent neurosurgical procedures for CVD between 1979 and 1998. Open surgery (n=448), endovascular procedures (n=22), and stereotactic radiosurgery (n=14) were the main neurosurgical procedures adopted. Clinical features and surgical outcomes were described according to the etiology of the CVD and the number of years of management. The mean duration of follow-up was 34 months. The mean age was 7.1 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. The most frequent CVD was moyamoya disease (62%). The surgical mortality related to CVD was 0.7%. Eighty-seven percent had Karnofsky Performance Scale scores of more than 70. We demonstrate increasing detection rates and improving outcomes in recent years. The clinical course in this study shows that recovery from CVD in children is good after neurosurgical procedures.
