BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic symptoms in children with Moyamoya syndrome are typically provoked by hyperventilation (HV) and are accompanied by the "re-build-up" phenomenon in EEG. The value of scintigraphic detection of HV-provoked perfusion deficits remains to be elucidated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In seven children with Moyamoya syndrome regional cerebral blood flow was assessed by 99mTc-ethyl-cysteine-dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after HV and under baseline conditions to identify ischemia prone regions. RESULTS: Regional marked hypoperfusion after HV was found in all patients. Predominant perfusion deficits were detected in the frontal lobes. CONCLUSION: ECD SPECT is a potential tool for the preoperative evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics and for monitoring angiosurgical therapies in Moyamoya disease.
