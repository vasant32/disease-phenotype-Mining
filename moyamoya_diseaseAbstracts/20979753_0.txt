 OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of intraoperative indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in the bypass surgery for moyamoya disease (MMD). METHODS: Thirty-seven MMD patients were surgically treated and prospectively recruited. Intraoperative ICGA was performed with a surgical microscope with integrated ICGA technology. ICGA was performed 60 times in 37 patients. In each patient, upon the completion of anastomosis, a near-infrared light emitted by laser diodes was used to illuminate the operating field and the intravascular fluorescence recorded by an optical filter-equipped video camera. Assessment of vascular patency and occlusion were also investigated. The findings of ICGA were compared with those of postoperative DSA (digital subtraction angiography). RESULTS: In all cases, excellent visualization of cerebral arteries was achieved. The information provided by intraoperative ICGA significantly changed the surgical procedures. ICGA was used to identify 2 nonfunctioning STA-MCA (superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery) bypasses and both could be revised successfully. In all cases the final findings of ICGA could be positively validated by DSA during the postoperative course. CONCLUSION: As one kind of intraoperative angiography, ICGA provides a reliable and rapid intraoperative assessment of bypass patency. ICGA has a high spatial resolution and it facilitates the identification of stenoses and obstruction at the anastomotic site or vascular obstructions. It is a helpful tool for the intraoperative evaluation of bypass patency.
