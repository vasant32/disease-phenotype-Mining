 BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data of paediatric moyamoya disease/syndrome (MMD/MMS) in non-Asian populations are scarce. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to every French neuropaediatric academic centre to estimate the prevalence, incidence, familial form rate and location of paediatric MMD/MMS cases. Specific paediatric data were also retrieved from the most recent nationwide Japanese study. RESULTS: A 100% response rate was obtained. The prevalence of paediatric MMD/MMS was estimated at 0.39/100,000 children (95% CI: 0.28-0.49), and the incidence was estimated at 0.065/100,000 children/year (95% CI: 0.025-0.12), with 7.5% familial cases. The prevalence was homogenous within the different administrative areas. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive survey of MMD/MMS in academic neuropaediatric centres suggests that the prevalence of the disease in children in France is approximately 1/20th of that estimated in Asia.
