The clinical and pathological features of 20 cases of moyamoya disease complicated with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) and verified by CT scanning, cerebral angiography and autopsy were reported. It seemed to the author that moyamoya disease appeared to be prone to cause PIVH, this hemorrhage being likely due to ischemic malacia in the ventricular wall. The tortuous, abnormal network vessels ruptured and bled as a result of infarction and damage of the walls of the miliary aneurysms. PIVH might be divided into two types: the panventricular hemorrhage and partial ventricular hemorrhage, according to the amount of blood that filled into the ventricles. 6 cases of the panventricular type were fatal. The symptoms were in conformity with the traditional concept of the most critical, intraventricular hemorrhage. The external ventricular drainage in combination with lumber puncture drainage would be the better way of treatment for these patients. 14 cases of the partial ventricular hemorrhage type showed the clinical features of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The treatment was similar to SAH too, and the prognosis was much better. It would be worth noting that moyamoya disease should be a factor not to be neglected in causing PIVH.
