 OBJECTIVE: In Moyamoya disease, the primary goal of treatment is to improve collateral circulation through angiogenesis. In the present study, we obtained and sub-cultured bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from rats without a cell-mediated immune response. Then, we injected the labeled BMSCs directly into adjacent temporal muscle during encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS). Three weeks after BMSC transplantation, we examined the survival of the cells and the extent of neovascularization. METHODS: We divided 20 rats into a BMSC transplantation group (n=12) and a control group (n=8). Seven days after the induction of chronic cerebral ischemia, an EMS operation was performed, and labeled BMSCs (1x106(6)/100 microL) were injected in the temporal muscle for the transplantation group, while an equivalent amount of culture solution was injected for the control group. Three weeks after the transplantation, temporal muscle and brain tissue were collected for histological examination and western blot analysis. RESULTS: The capillary/muscle ratio in the temporal muscle was increased in the BMSC transplantation group compared to the control group, showing a greater increase of angiogenesis (p<0.05). In the brain tissue, angiogenesis was not significantly different between the two groups. The injected BMSCs in the temporal muscle were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-positive by immunofluorescence staining. In both temporal muscle and brain tissue, the expression of VEGF by western blot analysis was not much different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: During EMS in a chronic cerebral ischemia rat model, the injection of BMSCs resulted in accelerated angiogenesis in the temporal muscle compared to the control group.
