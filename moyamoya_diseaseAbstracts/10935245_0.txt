INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya disease is generally considered to be paediatric cerebrovascular pathology, but in some cases the symptoms are seen in adults. Primary intraventricular hemorrhage, as a consequence of this disorder, is rare. One should be clear as to the diagnostic and neuroimaging criteria of 'definite moyamoya disease'. CLINICAL CASE: A 52 year old man with a family history of two brothers having died of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents and a personal history of headaches for many years and arterial hypertension. He was sent to us with stroke, headache, neck stiffness+4, disorientation in time and space and stuporous. On cranial CAT scan a small left intraventricular subependymal hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage were seen. Cerebral angiography showed the angiographic pattern of moyamoya disease and the arterial circulation of the posterior territory was highly developed and thus supplemented the blood supply to the brain. CONCLUSION: In few of the rare occurrence of this disorder in our setting and as a cause of primary intraventricular hemorrhage, we reviewed certain neuroradiological peculiarities of interest, such as the evolution, diagnostic criteria, angiographic classification and differential diagnosis of the moyamoya syndrome in relation to our case.
