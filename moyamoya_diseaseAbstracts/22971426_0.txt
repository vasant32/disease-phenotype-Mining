A 21-year-old patient suffering from neurofibromatosis type 1 had received radiotherapy for a chiasm glioma 17 years ago. Fourteen years later, there was progressive deterioration of several neurological functions. MRI scans showed a progressively increasing volume loss of the left hemisphere and stenoses around the circle of Willis with secondary parenchymal effects. Based on conventional cerebral angiography, the diagnosis 'moyamoya syndrome' was made.
