The authors studied 34 patients with juvenile ischemic cerebrovascular disease over a 15-year period. Of the 34 patients, 23 had intracranial occlusions attributed to cerebral thrombosis or embolism and 11 had occlusions resulting from moyamoya disease. Clinicopathological features were evaluated in the 23 cases with ischemic stroke, but not those with moyamoya disease. The cause of the arterial occlusion remained undetermined in 11 patients and was found to be an embolism based on congenital heart disease in 8, on trauma in 3, and on infection in 1. Cerebral angiography was performed in 21 patients. Of these, 17 had stenoses or occlusions corresponding to their symptoms. CT scans were performed in 10 patients; the lesion in question showed no stenosis or occlusion with cerebral angiography. With regard to prognosis, patients with unknown etiology had good outcomes compared with those with congenital heart disease. With respect to "acute infantile hemiplegia", 10 patients had convulsive seizures and 4 had a history of an earlier infection. Angiography and CT scans in patients with congenital heart disease demonstrated arterial occlusive sites in the middle cerebral artery region. Three patients had abscesses after their ischemic lesions.
