Moyamoya disease is an uncommon cerebrovascular disease characterized angiographically by progressive stenosis of the distal internal carotid arteries and proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries coupled with the development of a fine network of vessels at the base of the brain. In children, the disease causes recurrent hemisphere ischemia. A newly described operative procedure (encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis) was recently recommended by Matsushima and Inaba [Child's Brain 11: 155-170, 1984] and was used in a recent patient treated at the UCLA Medical Center. The procedure did not succeed in revascularizing the brain in spite of clinical and angiographic progression of the disease, but a conventional superficial temporal to middle cerebral bypass operation did.
