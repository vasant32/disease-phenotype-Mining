Moyamoya disease (MMD) often presents with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of saccular aneurysms. We describe three patients with cerebrovascular features of MMD in whom four aneurysms of the posterior circulation were endovascularly occluded by electrothrombosis using the recently developed Guglielmi electrically detachable coils (GDC). Near total occlusion was achieved in three aneurysms. Subtotal occlusion was achieved in one aneurysm. This patient developed complications related to the neuroleptic anesthesia administered for the procedure. The particular hazards of anesthesia and aneurysmal surgery in MMD are discussed, and comparison is made with the benefits of using the GDC. Initial experience suggests that this endovascular approach is safe and effective in the treatment of saccular aneurysms in MMD. However, follow-up is necessary to assess long-term persistence of aneurysm obliteration.
