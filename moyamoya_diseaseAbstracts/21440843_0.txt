 OBJECTIVE: To detect the content of the basic fibroblast growth factor in blood samples of patients with Moyamoya disease, and investigate the relationship between Moyamoya disease and the basic fibroblast growth factor. METHODS: This tissue microarray study included 24 cases of superficial temporal artery samples, 15 cases of Moyamoya disease, and 9 cases of normal arteries as control, and bFGF immunofluorescence assay was applied to test the samples. The number of positive cells and total cells of the muscular layer and the endothelium layer were counted separately in every picture, the positive rates were calculated, and the experimental data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The bFGF immunofluorescence staining of smooth muscular layer cells, intima cells and endothelial cells from the moyamoya disease group were obviously stronger than that from the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The enhancement expression of bFGF in the Moyamaya disease group implicates that bFGF plays an important part in the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease.
