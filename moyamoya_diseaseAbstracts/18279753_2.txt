The aim of this study was to review cases of pediatric arterial ischemic stroke among Chinese subjects and thereby evaluate risk factors, clinical and neuroimaging features, and treatment, to establish a reasonable guideline for assessment and management of the disease. Between 1996 and 2006, 157 children (male:female ratio, 1.4:1) with arterial ischemic stroke were identified at Beijing Children's Hospital. The median age at stroke was 32 months (range, 4-192). Among patients with determined etiology, infections (12.1%), moyamoya disease (12.1%), and trauma (10.8%) were the most common. In 51 patients, there were no obvious risk factors (32.5%). Hemiplegia was the most common presenting feature (81.5%). The region of left middle cerebral artery was most frequently affected (36.3%), followed by the right middle cerebral artery (29.9%). Of the 157 patients, 56 were treated by intravenous thrombolytic agents (35.7%), all but one of them successfully (the one exception involving hemorrhagic complication). Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish primary prevention, acute treatment, and secondary prevention of pediatric ischemic stroke.
