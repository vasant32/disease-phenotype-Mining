A 30-year-old female and a 38-year-old male developed "definite" moyamoya disease after presenting with "probable" moyamoya disease manifesting as ischemic stroke. Angiography at first presentation demonstrated unilateral involvement with normal contralateral findings. The cases were classified as adult type "probable" moyamoya disease according to the diagnostic criteria. Follow-up angiography demonstrated the occlusive lesions had become bilateral, satisfying the criteria for "definite" cases. Serial angiography is required in adults presenting with "probable" moyamoya disease manifesting as ischemic stroke.
