Moyamoya disease, associated with bilaterally persistent primitive trigeminal arteries and an aneurysm at the origin of the right trigeminal artery, was found in a 64-year-old woman who had suffered from a left caudate and intraventricular hemorrhage. This is the first report of such a vascular association, which may suggest a congenital factor in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease in this particular case.
