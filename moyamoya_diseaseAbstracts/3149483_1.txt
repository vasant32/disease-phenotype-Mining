A 33-month-old boy with recurrent stroke-like episodes had angiographic features characteristic of moyamoya syndrome. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was suspected because of lactic acidosis and ptosis. Studies of oxidative metabolism on isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed impairment of NADH-coenzyme Q reductase activity. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders may cause moyamoya syndrome when other known associated factors are absent.
