PURPOSE: To report a patient with congenital constrictive malformations of the internal carotid arteries and a morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA). METHODS: Descriptive case report. RESULTS: A 14-year-old girl underwent serial ophthalmologic examinations since the age of seven years because of blurred vision and floaters. A right optic disk anomaly was present that was most compatible with an MGDA accompanied by an inferior choroidal coloboma. Because of the association of such disc malformations with moyamoya disease, the patient underwent cerebral MRI and MRA that showed narrowing of both internal carotid arteries, a finding consistent with early-stage moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the association of MGDA with moyamoya disease, a treatable condition that may have devastating neurological consequences.
