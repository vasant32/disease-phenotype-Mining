 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in symptomatic moyamoya patients the effect of surgical revascularization on impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and its relationship to clinical outcome. METHODS: Brain revascularization was performed using a direct superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass or indirect encephalo-dural-arterial synangiosis. CVR was measured pre- and 3 months postoperatively using blood oxygen level-dependent MRI during iso-oxic hypercapnic changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide. Outcomes were assessed by MRI, clinical examination, and modified Rankin Scale scores. RESULTS: Fifty-five hemispheres were revascularized in 39 patients (superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery in 47, encephalo-dural-arterial synangiosis in 8). Surgery reversed CVR impairment in 52 hemispheres (94.5%) and in 36 of 39 patients (92.3%; Fisher exact test, P<0.001), and this was predictive of a patent extracranial-intracranial bypass. New, clinically silent perioperative hemorrhages, cortical foci of ischemia, or new white matter T2 hyperintensities were detected after 11 surgeries (20%), but no new lesions arose after 3 postoperative months. One patient had a clinical perioperative stroke (1.8%). In clinical follow-up, 37 of 39 patients (95%) had stable or improved modified Rankin Scale scores and 2 patients (5.1%) worsened. No patients with patent bypasses or CVR improvements exhibited new clinical symptoms, but failure of CVR improvement corresponded to a poorer long-term outcome (Fisher exact test, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral revascularization surgery is a safe and effective treatment for reversing preoperative CVR defects and may prevent recurrence of preoperative symptoms. Moreover, CVR measurements may be useful in long-term follow-up and for predicting bypass patency.
