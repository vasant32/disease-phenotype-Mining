A 61-year-old woman with a history of repeated cerebral hemorrhage due to moyamoya disease was admitted to our recovery period rehabilitation ward for walking training. She suddenly noticed paresthesia in her left forearm and the palm seven days later. Brain computed tomography on that day and magnetic resonance imaging on the next day after the onset of paresthesia revealed right thalamic hemorrhage. It was suggested that the hematoma localized to a small part of the central portion of the ventroposterior lateral nucleus caused paresthesia limited to the forearm and the palm. In a recovery period rehabilitation ward, we should carefully listen to the complaints of patients who are in advanced age and have a risk like our patient. Then adequate neurological examination should be performed for the pertinent inspection diagnosis, if needed.
