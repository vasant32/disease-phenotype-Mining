Nonatherosclerotic occlusive disease--narrowing of the carotid lumen without atherosclerosis--describes an uncommon but known group of angiographic defects. This phrase includes the entities: fibromuscular disease, moyamoya syndrome, arterial dissection, and extracranial carotid aneurysms. Although nursing care of these patients is often the same as for those patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease, there is a dearth of information available in nursing literature for use in patient education. This article will present definitions, symptoms (which may be the same as for those patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease), treatment, and prognosis to aid the development of patient teaching plans.
