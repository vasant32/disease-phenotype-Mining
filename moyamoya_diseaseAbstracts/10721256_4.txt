Three rare cases of purely intraventricular aneurysms are described, including a unique aneurysm in the fourth ventricle. A 30-year-old female, a 47-year-old male, and an 11-year-old girl presented with disturbance of consciousness due to massive intraventricular hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography revealed an idiopathic peripheral aneurysm in the fourth ventricle in the first patient, and aneurysms in the lateral ventricle associated with moyamoya disease in the latter two patients. The former two aneurysms were treated surgically and histologically confirmed to be pseudoaneurysms. The latter aneurysm disappeared spontaneously within 2 months after onset. The aneurysm in the lateral ventricle was resected via a parietal corticotomy with stereotactic insertion of an 8-Fr silicone tube to guide the approach route. This method was very useful because computerized neuronavigation was not available. The aneurysm in the fourth ventricle was resected via a midline suboccipital approach with C-1 laminectomy. Conservative treatment is usually recommended initially for patients with intraventricular aneurysm because spontaneous cure often occurs. We recommend direct surgery if the size of the aneurysm remains unchanged, because the risk of surgery has decreased recently owing to new techniques for neuronavigation.
