A nine-year-old Chinese boy had suffered from recurrent episodes of adversive seizure for about a year, seizures which affected the left upper limb, with his head and eyes turning toward the left. An acute attack of left upper-limb weakness and central-type facial palsy occurred before his consultation. Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed infarction of the right frontoparietal area, and increased density in the head of the left caudate nucleus. Cerebral angiographic study demonstrated a typical pattern of moyamoya disease with bilateral stenosis of the supraclinoid portion of internal carotid arteries. Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis with encephalomyosynangiosis were performed twice, with resulting good patency of blood flow observed in the follow-up angiographic study.
