Stroke in trisomy 21 may be due to cardioembolism, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, moyamoya disease, sinus venous thrombosis, internal carotid hypoplasia or infections like endocarditis with septic emboli, meningitis or brain abscess. In rare cases, however, stroke etiology remains unexplained. We present a 19 year old Caucasian girl with trisomy 21 with a 47XX+21 karyotype who suffered at age 11 years from a transient ischemic attack with left hemiparesis, and at age 17 years from an ischemic stroke in the territory of the right cerebral medial artery. She suffered from arterial hypertension, obesity and hypercholesterolemia. Since blood coagulation studies, immunologic parameters, blood cultures, 24-h Holter monitoring, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance angiography of the extra- and intracranial vessels, thoracic and abdominal aorta and renal arteries did not provide any explanation for the stroke, implantation of a loop recorder is considered in order to detect episodes of clinically silent atrial fibrillation.
