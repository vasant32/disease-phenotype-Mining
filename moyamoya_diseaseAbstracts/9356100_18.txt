To investigate the risk factors for postoperative neurological deterioration in patients with moyamoya disease, we retrospectively reviewed the perioperative course of 368 cases of revascularization surgery in 216 patients with this disease. Risk factors anecdotally associated with postoperative ischemic events were analyzed by comparing groups with or without a history of such events on the operative day. Ischemic events were noted in 14 cases (3.8%), 4 of which were defined as strokes and the others as transient ischemic attack (TIA). Postoperative neurological deterioration more often developed in patients who suffered from frequent TIAs, had precipitating factors for TIA, and underwent indirect nonanastomotic revascularization. The authors conclude that the incidence of postoperative ischemic events were related more to the severity of moyamoya disease and the type of surgical procedure than to other factors, including anesthetic management. IMPLICATIONS: Although preventing stroke is the major concern for patients with moyamoya disease, risk factors for perioperative cerebral ischemia have not been clarified. We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative course in 368 cases with this disease and found that the severity of the disease and type of surgical procedure were major determinants of postoperative cerebral ischemia.
