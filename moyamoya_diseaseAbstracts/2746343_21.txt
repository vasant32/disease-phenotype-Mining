Currently, superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis, encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS), and encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis are used to treat moyamoya disease and are reported to effectively improve ischemic symptoms. All are methods of reversing the flow of blood from the external carotid artery system into the cortical branches of the MCA. As moyamoya disease advances, these operations alone will predictably not correct the deterioration in blood flow in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. It was noted in a case of moyamoya disease with intraventricular hemorrhage that a burr hole, made in the frontal region for drainage purposes, induced marked neovascularization. Since then, similar frontal burr holes have been made in five juvenile cases of moyamoya disease; this procedure involved making a burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane. In two cases a frontal burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane. In two cases a frontal burr hole was placed simultaneously with EMS, and in the others the frontal burr hole was made following EMS. The clinical symptoms improved after the frontal burr hole was made, and dynamic computerized tomography revealed improved circulation in the frontal regions. Together with conventional surgical therapy for juvenile cases of moyamoya disease, this operation is considered beneficial both to the circulation in the frontal region and for the protection of frontal brain function.
