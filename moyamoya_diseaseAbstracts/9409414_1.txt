A total of 11 patients with Moyamoya disease who underwent digital subtraction angiography were studied with respect to the cerebral venous system. First, delayed venous filling and the divisional change of the superficial cerebral veins have been attributed to the development of collateral pathways in Moyamoya disease and may be reflective appearances for the pathophysiological conditions in Moyamoya disease. Particularly, delayed venous filling may be an important finding which predicts an ischemic attack. Secondarily, the inferior striate veins were frequently detected in proportion to the development of Moyamoya vessels. On the other hand, the superior striate veins were prominent in the decrement stage of Moyamoya vessels. These findings may give support to the pathological findings of Moyamoya vessels that there were observed various degrees of dilatation with venous-like vessels as well as dilated perforating arteries.
