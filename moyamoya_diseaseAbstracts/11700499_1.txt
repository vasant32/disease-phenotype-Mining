We report the case of a young white woman in whom cerebrovascular moyamoya disease, which was associated with nonarteriosclerotic peripheral artery disease of the subclavian, iliac, and femoropopliteal arteries, was diagnosed by means of angiography. During 8 years of follow-up, the peripheral artery disease progressed, without any signs characteristic of systemic inflammation or vasculitis, leading to severe calf and arm claudication. Despite the absence of histologic confirmation, this observation strongly suggests that peripheral artery involvement may be a feature of moyamoya disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of classical cerebrovascular moyamoya disease with peripheral artery disease.
