A 55-year old woman, suffering from bacteriologically proven tuberculous meningitis showed the angiographic signs typical of tuberculous arteritis: stenosis of the supraclinoid portion of the carotid syphon on the right stenosis of the basilar artery, multiple peripheral occulsions of mediumsize vessels and mild, internal hydrocephalus. As a rarity there was an unusual collateral supply through the basal Moyamoya net which supplied the occluded right middle branch; there was a transtentorial anastomosis of the left meningeal branch of the vertebral artery which supplied the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery in an orthograde manner. The developmental mechanism and radiological findings of this rare collateral system due to tuberculous meningoarteritis is discussed.
