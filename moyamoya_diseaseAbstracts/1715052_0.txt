A rare association of moyamoya disease with intra- and periventricular hemorrhage in an 8-year-old girl is presented. Angiography showed that the cause of hemorrhage was extravasation from the dilated anterior choroidal artery. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt and encephalomyosynangiosis have prevented clinical or neurological deficits for over 6 years.
