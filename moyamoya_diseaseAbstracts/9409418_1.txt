A review of the surgical and postoperative records of 127 revascularization procedures performed on 82 children with Moyamoya disease was done to evaluate changes we made in anesthetic management in response to perioperative complications. From 1982 to 1996, out of 82 children who underwent revascularization surgery at our hospital, five developed perioperative complications. One developed circulatory instability during surgery; the cause seemed to be a depth of anesthesia insufficient for preventing surgical stress. To rectify this problem, an increased dose of fentanyl was used to improve the maintenance of anesthesia. Four patients developed cerebral infarction during the early postoperative period due, in part, to inadequate management of postoperative pain. We began to administer supplemental doses of meperidine to patients after they emerged from anesthesia to provide better control of postoperative pain. Our review confirmed the effectiveness of these measures. The data suggest that during the perioperative management of children with Moyamoya disease, close attention should be paid to balancing the patients' anesthetic state against surgical stress and providing adequate postoperative analgesia.
