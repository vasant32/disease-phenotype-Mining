STA-MCA anastomosis was performed in a total of eight patients ranging in age from five to 42 years for treatment of symptomatic Moyamoya disease. All of the patients presented with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In most cases bilateral procedures were performed at separate operations. No patients have experienced increased neurological deficits as a result of surgery, while the ischemic symptoms have been relieved completely in most cases. The surgical procedure is especially demanding in the treatment of Moyamoya disease, but remains one of the few solutions to the treatment of this disease.
