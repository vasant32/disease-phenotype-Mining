Scalp necrosis is an infrequent complication of Moyamoya disease surgery, which is more prevalent in the parietotemporal area. Because scalp vascularity is severely compromised after Moyamoya disease surgery, reconstruction of defects with local scalp tissue is challenging. To cover defects, a flap is needed that is highly vascularized and has great mobility and territory to avoid existing scars. After tracing ipsilateral occipital artery, an advancement flap that was based on occipital artery and vein was designed to fit the defect. The flap was elevated in the subperiosteal layer and advanced without tension to cover the defect. Occipital pedicle V-Y advancement flaps were used in 7 patients who had scalp necrosis of the parietotemporal area and a mean defect size of 8.7 cm. There were no complications such as flap necrosis, infection, or recurrence of defect in all patients during 9-month follow-up. Occipital pedicle V-Y advancement flap is a useful alternative flap for scalp defects after surgical treatments that compromise scalp vascularity, such as Moyamoya disease surgery.
