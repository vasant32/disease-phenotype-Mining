OBJECTIVE: To report a case of proximal occlusion of 2 major cerebral vessels associated with moyamoya network circulation that manifested by spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage. DESIGN: Case report. PATIENT AND RESULTS: A 36-year-old Syrian man presented with symptoms of sudden-onset headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. The computed tomography scan of his brain showed intraventricular bleeding, and the subsequent 4 vessel angiographies revealed occlusion of the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries with moyamoya appearance in the terminal branches. The coagulation profile showed the presence of heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated conservatively until resolution of his blood clot, and later he was started on oral anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Factor V Leiden mutation may cause large cerebral vessel occlusion with moyamoya syndrome in adults.
