The incidence of Willis' ring obstruction (Moyamoya disease) in Japan is higher than in Europe and North America. The therapeutic technique usually employed is either surgery or Western drug treatment. But these methods are still not satisfactory. We attempted to apply Chinese medicinal treatment to a patient with Moyamoya disease. This patient was referred to our department because of the ineffectiveness of Western drug treatment. The patient made satisfactory progress with Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan and Xiao-Xu-Ming-Tang. We also noticed the improvement of the "stagnated blood condition." Whole blood viscosity was decreased and the blood flow rate in the bulbar conjunctiva was increased.
