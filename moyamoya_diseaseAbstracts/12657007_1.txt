Moyamoya disease is a rare, chronic cerebrovascular occlusive disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by progressive stenosis of the arteries of the circle of Willis leading to an abnormal capillary network and resultant ischemic strokes or cerebral hemorrhages. The association of moyamoya disease with livedo reticularis has been described in a previously reported patient with a factor V Leiden mutation, leading to hypercoagulation. We describe a girl with livedo reticularis and moyamoya disease with extensive cardiovascular malformations, but without a primary coagulopathy.
