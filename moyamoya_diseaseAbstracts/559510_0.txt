Attempts were made to evaluate the EEG findings in 16 children and 12 adults with Moyamoya disease. (1) The children revealed specific findings such as hemispheric posterior slow (HP slow), centrotemporal slow (CT slow) and re-build-up after the end of hyperventilation. (2) HP slow was mainly observed in EEG examined within one year after the initial onset. In children in whom EEG was performed more than three years after the onset, chronic suppressive findings were found on EEG. (3) Buildup after the end of hyperventilation was revealed in almost all the children, which we called "Re-build-up". (4) No specific findings were verified on EEG in adult Moyamoya, beside slight abnormalities.
