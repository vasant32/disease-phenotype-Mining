Three to four overlapping cerebral CT scans were obtained after the injection of a single bolus of contrast medium. The rapid sequential dynamic scanning was carried out with table increments, while there was peak iodine density in the carotid artery. The demonstration of cerebral vessel lesions (aneurysms, moyamoya disease, arteriovenous malformations, arterial narrowing, etc.) is easier and safer with this method as compared with the conventional multiple injection technique.
