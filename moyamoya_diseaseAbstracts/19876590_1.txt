Moyamoya disease associated with a germinoma has never yet been reported in the literature. This report describes a case of a cystic neurohypophysial germinoma associated with moyamoya disease. A 15-year-old girl with central diabetes insipidus was admitted to the hospital. Radiological examination revealed a suprasellar tumor and moyamoya disease. Surgery and pathological study confirmed pure germinoma. After the patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the tumor was controlled without any effect on the moyamoya vessels. This report describes a rare incidental combination of moyamoya disease and a suprasellar germinoma. In the management of such cases, physicians should be aware of the symptoms, course, and natural history of both diseases and the effects and side effects of each type of therapy.
