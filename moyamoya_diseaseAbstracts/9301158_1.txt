Moya Moya disease is a rare disease causing occlusion of the supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries. The CT, MRI and Angiography findings of four patients of Moya Moya disease are presented. CT revealed presence of infarction in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and atrophy in all patients who had CT. CT was also able to detect abnormal vessels at basal ganglia in one patient. MRI was more informative and besides showing the infarctions and atrophy it also revealed abnormal Moya Moya vessels in all patients. Cerebral angiography is the most definitive method of diagnosis. It showed occlusion of supra clinoid portion of internal carotid arteries on both sides in three patients and on one side in one patient. It also showed pressure of Moya Moya vessels in all cases. It also showed collaterals from meningeal and ophthalmic arteries in all cases. Imaging findings of Moya Moya disease are very specific and provide early diagnosis.
