Ocular ischemic syndrome is extremely rare in childhood. Patients with moyamoya disease may be particularly susceptible to the development of ocular ischemia due to the associated carotid occlusion. A 19-month-old boy presented with neurofibromatosis and signs of ocular ischemia. At 29 months of age, he developed dense right vitreous hemorrhage and eventually lost vision in that eye due to phthisis. At almost six years of age, he developed an acute hemiplegia and was then diagnosed with moyamoya disease. This rare instance of childhood ocular ischemia in conjunction with moyamoya disease and neurofibromatosis demonstrates the serious ocular and systemic sequelae of occlusive vascular disease.
