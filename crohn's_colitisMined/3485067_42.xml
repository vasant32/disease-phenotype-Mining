<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum anticolon antibodies, crossreacting with portal tracts, have been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but no studies have been carried out in primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of serum anticolon antibodies and portal tract antibodies have been measured in 24 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>; 15 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>; 77 patients without primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>: 25 patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>; 10 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>; 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005398" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extrahepatic biliary obstruction</z:e> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum anticolon and portal tract antibodies were detected using immunoperoxidase techniques on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and obstructed human liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue typing was undertaken using a standard microcytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of anticolon antibodies was markedly increased in primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (62.5%) compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (17%) and Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (16%) (chi 2 = 17.9; p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were almost entirely of IgG and IgA classes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticolon antibodies were not found in sera from any other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sera from eight of 15 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and anticolon antibody reacted with portal tracts of human obstructed liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reaction was also seen in four of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> and in three of 15 patients with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Portal tract antibody was of IgG class and was not present in sera from any other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike anticolon antibody, there was a close relationship between HLA-B8 phenotype and the portal tract antibody (p&lt;0.02; chi 2 = 6.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies confirmed that the anticolon antibody is distinct from portal tract antibody </plain></SENT>
