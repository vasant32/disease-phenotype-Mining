<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-Aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) is well accepted for the maintenance treatment of inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> may also be effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As treatment with 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may result in less side effects, the efficacy of a one year's maintenance treatment with oral 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (1.5 g/d, slow release tablets, n = 19) and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (1.5 g/d, slow release tablets, n = 21) was compared in a double blind, randomised trial in patients with quiescent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn's ileocolitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ileocolonic or colonic involvement were enrolled if in stable remission for more than two months but less than one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline demography and clinical severity were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total colonoscopy and ileoscopy were performed at enrollment and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After one year seven of 19 patients receiving 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (36%) and 8 of 21 receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> (38%) had developed a clinical relapse, as defined by a rise in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) of more than 100 points to values higher than 150 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relapse rates between the 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> groups were not statistically different although no comparison with the spontaneous relapse rate in a placebo group could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical relapse was accompanied by a statistically significant rise in serum concentrations of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and by an increased percentage of activated peripheral blood T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences between the 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> groups regarding the height of rise in CDAI or of soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations during relapse, thus showing a similar severity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 4-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> maybe as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> in the maintenance treatment of quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and there were no differences in the severity of relapse between both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
