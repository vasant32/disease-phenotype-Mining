<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ever since its earliest reports, portal venous gas (PVG) has been associated with numerous intraabdominal catastrophes and has served as an indication for urgent surgical exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is traditionally regarded to be an ominous finding of impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, with highest mortality reported in patients with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today, computed tomography has demonstrated a wider range of clinical conditions associated with PVG, some of which are "benign" and do not necessarily require surgery, unless when there are signs of intraabdominal catastrophe or systemic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these "benign" conditions is <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present report describes a 19-year-old Chinese boy with Crohn's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> who presented with septic shock associated with PVG and portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and was successfully managed surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of PVG and portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in a Chinese patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have also reviewed the reports of another 18 Crohn's patients with PVG previously described in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific predisposing factors for PVG were identified in 8 patients, including <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema, colonoscopy, blunt abdominal trauma, and enterovenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients who developed PVG following <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema and blunt trauma were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> asymptomatic and no specific treatment was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (58%) who presented with signs of intraabdominal catastrophe or systemic toxicity required either immediate or eventual surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate among the 19 patients was only 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present literature review has shown that the finding of PVG associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> does not always mandate surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is the clinical features and the related complications that ultimately determine the treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall outcome of PVG associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has been favourable </plain></SENT>
