<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rectal biopsy specimens from control subjects, patients with either active or quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were examined histologically and assayed for marker enzymes associated with tissue organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were catalase (peroxisome); neutral alpha-glucosidase (endoplasmic reticulum); alkaline phosphatase (plasma membrane); malate dehydrogenase (mitochondria); <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (cytosol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in these enzyme activities in patient samples compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activities of three acid hydrolases (lysosomal enzymes), beta-glucuronidase, acid phosphatase, and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-beta-glucosaminidase, were also assayed in the biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased activities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three enzymes were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, particularly in active disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of lysosomal integrity by assays of latent N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-beta-glucosaminidase activity revealed similar results in control and colitic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the lysosomal changes reflect a specific tissue release of enzyme and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the tissue damage </plain></SENT>
