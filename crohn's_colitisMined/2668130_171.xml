<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings were prospectively collected by a multicentre group in 75 patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> according to a previously validated procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of nine preselected lesions was recorded in the following segments (1) rectum, (2) sigmoid and left colon, (3) transverse colon, (4) right colon, and (5) ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition the extent of the diseased and ulcerated areas were estimated in each segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These segmental data were recorded on a standard form, together with the endoscopist's global estimate of lesion severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stepwise multiple regression was used to derive an index which was correlated with the endoscopist's global evaluation of lesion severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four mucosal lesions: deep and superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated stenosis, and both estimates of extent involved were selected and weighted to obtain a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Endoscopic Index of Severity which correlated with the endoscopist's global appraisal of lesion severity (r = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This index was then prospectively shown to be valid in a further series of 113 colonoscopies (r = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The index was calculated in 54 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, before and at the end of a course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>: index variations correctly reflected changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> severity as evaluated by the endoscopists (r = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For endoscopists familiar with the data collection procedure, this <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Endoscopic Index of Severity should be of value in the follow up of patients, especially in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
