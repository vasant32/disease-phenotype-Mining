<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> had been meaningful but modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> led to clinical responses never before realized but it took much too long to recognize that they were not capable of maintaining remission, that adverse reactions were subtle but potentially devastating and that some other agent would be necessary to capitalize on their transient advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This of course was true in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Not much was ever made of the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, but with the severing of the diazobond and the elimination of the sulphur component, the 5-aminosalacylic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>) products clearly led to clinical improvement, especially in cases of Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> where the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> product was released in the terminal ileum and more proximal in the small bowel as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induction of remission was first demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>) with case reports and uncontrolled trials in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but its placebo controlled trial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> firmly established its role in inducing remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No subsequent trial has confirmed its similar role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but nevertheless clinicians know well that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> works at least as well and probably more effectively for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
