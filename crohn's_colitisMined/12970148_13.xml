<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of fulminant Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> that occurred following non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> by haematopoietic cells is recognised in several animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> and remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has been reported in patients who have received a bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, adoptive transfer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> susceptibility leading to phenotypic manifestation of the disease after transplantation has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Having ruled out an infective cause of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in this case, we speculated that adoptive transfer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may have occurred and performed a genetic analysis of known susceptibility loci for significant donor-recipient mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donor and recipient had several haplotype mismatches in HLA class III genes at the IBD3 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the donor (but not the recipient) had a polymorphism of the 5' UTR of NOD2/CARD15 that may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case highlights the question of whether adoptive transfer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> can occur between allogeneic stem cell transplant donor and recipient, in a similar fashion to that reported for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report should also stimulate debate regarding the need for stem cell transplant donor screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
