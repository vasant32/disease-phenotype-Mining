<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study adherence to the widely accepted surveillance guidelines for patients with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 244 gastroenterologists in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastroenterologists, 95% performed endoscopic surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients and 65% in patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines were followed by 27%, while 27% and 46% followed their local hospital protocol or no specific protocol, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surveillance was correctly initiated in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e> by 53%, and in cases of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> by 44% of the gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although guidelines recommend 4 biopsies every 10 cm, less than 30 biopsies per colonoscopy were taken by 73% of the responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 31%, 68% and 58% of the gastroenterologists referred patients for colectomy when low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> Associated Lesion or Mass (DALM) was present, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most Dutch gastroenterologists perform endoscopic surveillance without following international recommended guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This practice potentially leads to a decreased sensitivity for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, rendering screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in this population highly ineffective </plain></SENT>
