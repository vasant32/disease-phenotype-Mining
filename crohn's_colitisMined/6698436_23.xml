<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the outcome of 63 consecutive patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> treated by colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis between 1951-1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serious postoperative complications occurred in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up since colectomy was 9.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 10 years the cumulative reoperation rate was 48% and the cumulative recurrence rate (based upon operative, radiological, and sigmoidoscopic evidence) was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients have died during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the patients still under review have an intact ileorectal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis is a useful operation in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ill health, diarrhoea, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in whom there is minimal anorectal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For suitable patients, the operation avoids the morbidity of a permanent stoma, pelvic dissection, and rectal excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence developing in the ileum proximal to the anastomosis can often be resected and intestinal continuity preserved, whereas anorectal recurrence usually requires proctectomy </plain></SENT>
