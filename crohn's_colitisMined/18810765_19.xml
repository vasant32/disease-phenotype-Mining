<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most commonly, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurs in the small intestine and/or in the colon with stable disease location over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of both disease phenotypes is complex, the likely primary defect lies in the innate rather than adaptive immunity, particularly in the chemical antimicrobial barrier of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> is associated with a reduced expression of the Wnt signalling pathway transcription factor T-cell factor 4 (TCF4), which is regulating Paneth cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, the alpha-defensins and principal Paneth cell products HD5 and HD6 are deficiently expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e>, independent of current <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> is typically associated with an impaired induction of the beta-defensins HBD2 and HBD3 caused by fewer gene copy numbers in the gene locus of the beta-defensins on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This ileal and colonic defect in innate defence mediated by a deficiency of the protective alpha- and beta-defensins may enable the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> microbes to invade the mucosa and trigger the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms behind ileal and colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> may give rise to new therapeutic strategies based on a stimulation of the protective innate immune system </plain></SENT>
