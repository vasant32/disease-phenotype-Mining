<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi> therapy for maintenance of remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the prophylactic properties of olsalazine in comparison with placebo for maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomised, double blind, parallel group study of olsalazine versus placebo, 328 patients with quiescent Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of olsalazine 2.0 g daily or placebo for 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of efficacy was relapse, as defined by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) and by clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and clinical disease activity indicators were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety analysis consisted of documentation of adverse events and laboratory values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in the frequency of termination due to relapse or time to termination due to relapse were noted between the two treatment groups (olsalazine 48.5% v placebo 45%) for either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The failure rate, defined as not completing the study, was significantly higher in olsalazine treated patients compared with placebo treated patients for the overall population (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e>: olsalazine 65.4% v 53.9%; p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar failure rates were seen for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher percentage of olsalazine treated patients experienced adverse gastrointestinal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Drug attributed adverse events were reported more frequently in the olsalazine treated group with gastrointestinal symptoms being causally related to olsalazine treatment (olsalazine 40.7% v placebo 26.9%; p=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>Back pain</z:hpo> was reported significantly more often by the placebo treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, serious medical events did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adverse events led to more early withdrawals in the olsalazine treated group than in the placebo treated group; thus average time in the study for patients in the olsalazine treatment group was significantly shorter than that of patients in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with olsalazine were more likely to terminate their participation in the trial than those taking placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This difference was not related to relapse of disease, as measured by CDAI and clinical measures, but rather was due to the development of intolerable adverse medical events of a non-serious nature related to the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal related events in the olsalazine treated group may be due to the difference in gastrointestinal status at baseline which favoured the placebo treatment group </plain></SENT>
