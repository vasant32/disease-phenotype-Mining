<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contractions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi>, and Bay K 8644 were decreased in circular smooth muscles isolated from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063">2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> rat colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the absolute force and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitivity of contractile proteins were not affected as assessed in alpha-toxin permeabilized smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current density of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel in circular smooth muscle cells was significantly decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-treated colonic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, expressions of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein did not differ between control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-treated preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> partially recovered the decreased contractility and current density of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the decrease in the contraction of circular smooth muscle isolated from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> rat colon, which may be related to gut dysmotility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, is attributable to the decreased activity of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dysfunction of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel may be mediated by NF-kappaB-dependent pathways </plain></SENT>
