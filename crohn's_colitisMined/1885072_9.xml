<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient had definite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but three displayed DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No concomitant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected but the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is rare in patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, but findings of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, can be made </plain></SENT>
