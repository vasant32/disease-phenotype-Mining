<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To further elucidate the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> formation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gallbladder bile was obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> who were admitted for elective surgery (17 with ileal/ileocolonic disease and 7 with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> patients served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duodenal bile was obtained from ten healthy subjects before and after the treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bile was analyzed for biliary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, crystals, and crystal detection time (CDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol saturation index was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The biliary concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was about 50% higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011980'>cholesterol gallstones</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> involving ileum and three of those with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> had cholesterol saturated bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> and one of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> displayed cholesterol crystals in their bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 1/3 of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a short CDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of healthy subjects with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> did not increase the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in duodenal bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, with or without ileal resection/disease had gallbladder bile supersaturated with cholesterol and short CDT and contained cholesterol crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The biliary concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was also increased in patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> probably not due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Several factors may be of importance for the high risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> of both cholesterol and pigment types in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
