<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five healthy children, mean age 12.4 years (range 10-17 years), were studied as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients were taking sulphasalazine, but none were taking steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transit time was determined by carmine and did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Faeces were collected for 72 hours, and faecal water was prepared by centrifugation of faeces at 15,000 x g for two hours </plain></SENT>
