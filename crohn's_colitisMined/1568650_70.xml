<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that intestinal permeability to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 400 is increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and their apparently unaffected first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the implications that these findings have for the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> these studies were repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 28) and 32 first degree relatives from 11 families underwent a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 400 (PEG400) intestinal permeability test and a hyperosmotic (1500 mosmol/l) absorption/permeability test using 3-0-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15936,53455">D-xylose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16055">L-rhamnose</z:chebi>, lactulose, and 51chromium labelled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30347">ethylenediamine</z:chebi>-tetraacetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The five hour urine excretion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 400 did not differ significantly between controls (n = 25) and first degree relatives, 25.5 (3.3)% v 24.6% (4)% (mean(SD)) p greater than 0.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with small bowel involvement excreted significantly less (p less than 0.01) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 400 (16.3 (4.6)% than controls while those with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> did not (26.4 (3.9)% p greater than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The permeation of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and their first degree relatives did not differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The permeation of lactulose and 51chromium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30378">ethylenediaminetetraacetate</z:chebi> was not significantly altered in first degree relatives but was significantly increased in the patients, as was the lactulose/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16055">L-rhamnose</z:chebi> urine excretion ratio which is a specific measure of small intestinal permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> absorption and permeability in first degree relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A genetically determined abnormality of intestinal permeability is not likely to be an important aetiological factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
