<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations in genes encoding components of the complex result in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granulomatous disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e> often develop <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> that is histologically similar to Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, suggesting a common aetiology for both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine if polymorphisms in NOX2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase complex genes that do not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e> are associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to identify susceptibility loci in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase complex genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional studies were carried out on identified variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Novel findings were replicated in independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified a novel missense variant in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2) gene that is associated with very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD (VEO-IBD) and subsequently found in 4% of patients with VEO-IBD compared with 0.2% of controls (p=1.3Ã—10(-5), OR 23.8 (95% CI 3.9 to 142.5); Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This variant reduced binding of the NCF2 gene product p67(phox) to RAC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study found a novel genetic association of RAC2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and replicated the previously reported association of NCF4 with ileal CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that the rare novel p67(phox) variant results in partial inhibition of oxidase function and are associated with CD in a subgroup of patients with VEO-IBD; and suggest that components of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase complex are associated with CD </plain></SENT>
