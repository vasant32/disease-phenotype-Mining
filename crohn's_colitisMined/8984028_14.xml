<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> is an important energy source for the colon and its metabolism has been reported to be defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One mechanism for defective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> metabolism in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> could be an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme deficiency</z:e> in the beta-oxidation pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study was undertaken to measure the activity of each enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 33), Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (n = 10), and control subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (n = 73) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis was carried out using fluorometric and spectrophotometric techniques on homogenised epithelial biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15517">butyryl CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase activity was found in mucosa from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (33.2 (28.3, 38.1) mumol/g wet weight/min:mean (95% CI)) compared with activity in mucosa from control patients (24.3 (20.9, 27.7) mumol/g wet weight/min:mean (95% CI)) p &lt; 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in activity of the enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15517">butyryl-CoA</z:chebi> synthetase, crotonase or hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast the mucosal thiolase activity was significantly lower in those patients with quiescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (3.21 (2.61, 3.81) mumol/g wet weight/min:mean (95% CI)) when compared with control mucosa (5.69 (5.09, 6.29) mumol/g wet weight/min:mean (95% CI)) p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, mucosal thiolase activity increases with the age of the donor patient and differences in the age range of the patient groups probably account for this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no substantial deficiency of enzyme activity in the beta-oxidation pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in the mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in histological remission </plain></SENT>
