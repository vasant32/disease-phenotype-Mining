<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients have had a colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> of whom 13 now have a stoma because they either required a protectomy (n=9) or where closure of a loop ileostomy had not been possible (n=4) because of severe anorectal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated volume was less than 150 ml in 12 of 13 patients who now have a stoma compared with none of the 20 patients who have a functioning anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the correlation between a radiological assessment of rectal capacity and the maximum tolerated volume was poor, a severely contracted rectum was associated with the need for a stoma in six of seven patients compared with only two of 13 patients who did not have radiological signs of a narrow rectum </plain></SENT>
