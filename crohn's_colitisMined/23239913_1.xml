<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their young age and poor general conditions, worsened by the aggressive medical treatments, make minimally invasive approaches particularly enticing to this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the typical inflammatory changes that characterize these diseases have hindered wide diffusion of laparoscopy in this setting, currently mostly pursued in high-volume referral centers, despite accumulating evidences in the literature supporting the benefits of minimally invasive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The largest body of evidence currently available for terminal ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> shows improved short term outcomes after laparoscopic surgery, with prolonged operative times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, high quality evidence supporting laparoscopic surgery is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Encouraging preliminary results have been obtained with the adoption of laparoscopic restorative total proctocolectomy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consensus about patients' selection and the need for staging has not been reached yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, a wave of enthusiasm is pushing towards less invasive strategies, to further minimize surgical trauma, with single incision laparoscopic surgery being the most realistic future development </plain></SENT>
