<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small bowel effluent and a <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> ultrafiltrate of it were reintroduced into the defunctioned colon of patients with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> treated by split ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The systemic effect of these challenges on the patients was assessed clinically and by laboratory tests, and the effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> was assessed by endoscopy, histology, and quantitative analysis of lamina propria plasma cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was little response to the ultrafiltrate challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast the clinical responses to challenge with ileostomy effluent were marked in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed and eight others had clinically detectable responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand changes in laboratory, endoscopic, histological, and morphometric tests in response to the faecal challenge were less pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant changes in the laboratory results were a relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) and a raised ESR (p less than 0.02) after seven days challenge with the effluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma cell density also increased but not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that factors greater than 0.22 microns in the faecal stream are responsible for the maintenance and exacerbation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
