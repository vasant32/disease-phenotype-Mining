<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were subdivided into three groups, graded according to severity into seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, severe, nine with active, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, and seven with quiescent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control cultures of lymphocytes without any added potential stimulant the uptake of (3)H-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in the clinical subgroup of seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was significantly greater than in seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This contrasted with a reduced uptake of (3)H-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> by lymphocytes from seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> when compared with seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further duplicate cultures of lymphocytes specifically stimulated by an equal number of viable autologous rectal epithelial cells, the uptake of (3)H-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> was significantly greater in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> when compared with seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The uptake of (3)H-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> was directly related to the clinical severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in the three subgroups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, four of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were studied later in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were then found to have a significantly reduced uptake of (3)H-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in response to autologous rectal epithelial cells (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
