<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship between appendectomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Swedish-Danish cohort study was conducted to assess the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> after an appendectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 709 353 appendectomy patients in Sweden (since 1964) and Denmark (since 1977) were followed for first hospitalisations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) served as relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 1655 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> cases were observed during 11.1 million person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas appendectomy before the age of 10 years was not associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (SIR 1.00; 95% CI 0.80-1.25), the overall SIR of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was 1.52 (95% CI 1.45-1.59), being highest in the first 6 months (SIR 8.69; 95% CI 7.68-9.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIR diminished rapidly thereafter, with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> reaching background levels after 5-10 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> overall, as well as for Crohn's <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp>, ileocolonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and other/unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A long-term increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> up to 20 years after the appendectomy was seen only in appendectomy patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">appendicitis</z:e> or mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transient increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> after an appendectomy is probably explained by diagnostic bias </plain></SENT>
