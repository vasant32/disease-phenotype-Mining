BACKGROUND: Glandular cheilitis (GC) is a rarely recognized disease of the accessory salivary glands of the lips, particularly of the lower lip. Clinically, three variants have been described: cheilitis glandularis simplex, cheilitis glandularis suppurativa, and cheilitis glandularis apostematosa. Most cases are diagnosed as the simple form of glandular cheilitis, which is characterized by enlarged excretory ducts, induration, and enlargement of the salivary glands as well as production of a rather mucopurulent saliva. CASE REPORTS: Two patients are described who revealed the characteristic changes of cheilitis glandularis simplex (case 1, 75-year-old male patient; case 2, 83-year-old female patient). In case 1 the patient developed a retention cyst of the upper lip probably as a consequence of GC. DIAGNOSIS: Histologically, ectasia of glandular ducts and chronic sialadenitis are typical features. Therapy formerly consisted of antibiotics and locally applied corticosteroids; an optimal oral hygiene, however, is mandatory. Advanced stages have to be treated surgically. Glandular cheilitis has been considered a precancerous lesion, although no definite scientific proof has ever been presented. Cheilitis granulomatosa, cheilitis exfoliativa, and self-induced changes (Munchausen syndrome) have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of glandular cheilitis.
