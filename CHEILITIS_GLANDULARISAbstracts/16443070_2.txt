We report the case of an 84-year-old white male who underwent vermilionectomy for removal of a tumor, which proved to be squamous cell carcinoma. Chelitis glandularis related to marked actinic damage was noted at a subsequent visit. The presence of chelitis glandularis should be investigated for the presence of neoplasia, immunosuppression, or inflammatory diseases related to extremely poor oral hygiene.
