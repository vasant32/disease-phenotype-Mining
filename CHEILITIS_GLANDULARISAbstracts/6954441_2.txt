Cheilitis glandularis is an uncommon lesion affecting the lower lip. Its origin remains obscure, although it is hypothesized that chronic irritation secondary to prolonged solar exposure causes hypertrophy of the labial salivary glands and eventual enlargement and ectropion of the lower lip. Although carcinoma of the lower lip has been reported in association with it, cheilitis glandularis is still considered a benign process that is adequately managed with conservative surgery. A case is presented and its surgical management is described.
