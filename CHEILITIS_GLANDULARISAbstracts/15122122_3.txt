 OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and spectrum of oral manifestations of HIV-infected drug-users in the Perm region. SUBJECTS: 104 seropositive HIV-infected drug-users (69 male, 35 female; ages 15 to 32 years; 13 co-infected with hepatitis viruses) and 13 AIDS-infected drug-users (7 male, 6 female; ages 16 to 37 years; 12 co-infected with hepatitis viruses). RESULTS: The most frequent forms of oral mucosal lesions in the HIV-infected group -- candidiasis (32.7%), herpetic lesions (15.4%), cheilitis glandularis (3.9%), recurrent aphthous stomatitis (2%). Regional lymphadenopathy was observed in 31% cases. The ulceronecrotic oral mucosal lesions were seen in the sublingual region and tongue in 11.5% patients and manifested with pain, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dysgeusia. These lesions were found in drug-users who injected the opioids sublingually. AIDS patients had oral candidiasis (84.6%), herpetic lesions (53.8%), recurrent aphthous stomatitis (15.4%) and cheilitis glandularis (7%). All AIDS-patients had severe xerostomia, and 15.4% had unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid glands. Generalized ulceronecrotic gingivostomatitis was found in 50% of the patients but the sublingual ulceronecrotic lesions were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The spectrum of oral cavity lesions of HIV/AIDS patients in Perm region is widespread enough. 2. Dissemination of oral cavity lesions is increasing in proportion of disease progression. 3. Dental care of HIV/AIDS patients should include periodic oral examinations to monitor their disease progression and to alleviate symptoms of oral opportunic and neoplastic diseases, to improve the life-style of the patients infected with HIV.
