In a recurring lesion on the palate of a 60-year-old male, histological features of a chronic inflammatory disease of the minor salivary glands resembling those found in cheilitis glandularis were found. The similarities between the clinical and histological features of our case and cheilitis glandularis are discussed and the inherent nature of the disease emphasised. We propose the terms persistent sialadenitis of the minor glands or stomatitis glandularis, for this condition.
