Cheilitis glandularis (CG), is a rare inflammatory minor salivary gland disease affecting the lower lip. The hallmarks of which include progressive enlargement and eversion of the lower labial mucosa resulting in the obliteration of the mucosal-vermillion interface. A case is presented of a 47-year-old HIV-infected woman who initially manifested clinical features of CG with a typical histopathology picture of a non-specific sialadenitis while a second biopsy performed six months later revealed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). She is symptom free one year following excision and radiotherapy treatment.
