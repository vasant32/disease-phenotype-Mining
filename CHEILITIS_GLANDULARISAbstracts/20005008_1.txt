 BACKGROUND: Cheilitis glandularis (CG) is a condition in which thick saliva is secreted by minor labial salivary glands and adheres to a swollen lip causing discomfort to the patient. Most publications refer to single case reports or small case series. OBJECTIVE: We sought to report and to analyze clinical, pathological, and therapeutic data on 22 patients with CG seen at the department of dermatology at our university. METHOD: Retrospective data about 22 patients with CG are reviewed and presented. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were male and 5 were female. All were fair skinned, including 6 albino individuals. Several of them presented significant signs of photodamage on the lips. Surgical treatment was performed in 10 severely affected patients and consisted of a vermilionectomy followed by minor salivary gland removal. Histopathological study revealed various degrees of chronic sialadenitis and vermilion epithelial changes. Superficially invasive and in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion was detected in 3 cases. LIMITATIONS: Biopsy and surgery were not performed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: CG is strongly related to sun sensitivity and may be more severe in albino patients. The swollen, sun-exposed lip may become more susceptible to the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma.
