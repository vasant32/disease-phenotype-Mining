Four cases of factitious crusting of the lips in women are reported. Two of the women had hemorrhagic crusts, and two had keratotic yellow crusts. All four patients had personality disturbances. Biting, picking, or unconscious licking of the lips may be the underlying mechanism for trauma and crust formation. This entity should be distinguished from contact cheilitis, actinic cheilitis, infectious cheilitis glandularis, and cheilitis granulomatosa. Some cases of exfoliative cheilitis may also be factitious. The presence of bizarre hemorrhagic or keratotic crusts on the lips should alert the clinician to a possible factitious origin, and a psychiatric evaluation should be done.
