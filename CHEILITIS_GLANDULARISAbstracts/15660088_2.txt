Cheilitis glandularis (CG) is a rare inflammatory salivary gland disease that usually affects the lips. Although the etiology of CG is still unknown, it is believed to be a hereditary disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Three clinical presentations of CG are described in the literature: simple, superficial suppurative, and deep suppurative. A case of deep suppurative CG that extended to the buccal mucosa has been previously reported as suppurative stomatitis glandularis (SSG). Here we report a case of SSG in a 64-year-old white female with a history of bilateral renal transplants for adult polycystic kidney disease, who presented with painful swollen lips and bilateral buccal mucosal lesions. The diagnosis and management of the case is discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second report of SSG, a rare condition affecting the minor salivary glands in the oral cavity.
