Six patients (four male and two female) with factitious cheilitis are described. All had personality disturbances as well as crusted lip lesions that varied in severity from thin serous crusts to thick hemorrhagic crusts. This entity must be distinguished from infectious cheilitis, contact cheilitis, actinic cheilitis, photosensitivity dermatoses, exfoliative cheilitis, and cheilitis glandularis on the basis of the history and laboratory evaluation.
