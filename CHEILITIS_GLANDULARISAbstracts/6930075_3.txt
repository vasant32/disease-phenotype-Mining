A case of cheilitis glandularis simplex occuring in a 65-year-old white man is presented. The condition is characterized by an everted lower lip, with enlarged labial salivary glands secreting a clear, thick mucus. A history of sun exposure, dry atrophic lip, and histologic findings of epithelial dysplasia, sclerosed glands, markedly dilated ducts, chronic inflammation, and basophilic degeneration of collagen indicate a solar etiology. Surgical excision by vermilionectomy gave excellent results. A high incidence of severe epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma associated with cheilitis glandularis indicate surgery as the treatment of choice.
