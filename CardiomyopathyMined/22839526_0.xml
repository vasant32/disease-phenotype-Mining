<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) enables state-of-the-art in vivo evaluations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although LGE patterns have been well described in asymmetrical septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, conflicting results have been reported regarding the characteristics of LGE in apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ApHCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine 1) the frequency and distribution of LGE and 2) its prognostic implication in ApHCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic pure ApHCM (age, 60.2 ± 10.4 years, 31 men) were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LGE images were acquired using the inversion recovery segmented spoiled-gradient echo and phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence, and analyzed using a 17-segment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summing the planimetered LGE areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> short axis slices yielded the total volume of late enhancement, which was subsequently presented as a proportion of total LV myocardium (% LGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean maximal apical wall thickness was 17.9±2.3 mm, and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 67.7 ± 8.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient presented with electrocardiographic negative T wave inversion in anterolateral leads, with a mean maximum negative T wave of 7.2 ± 4.7 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (22.5%) had giant negative T waves, defined as the amplitude of ≥ 10 mm, in electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LGE was detected in 130 segments of 30 patients (75.0%), occupying 4.9 ± 5.5% of LV myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LGE was mainly detected at the junction between left and right ventricles in 12 (30%) and at the apex in 28 (70%), although LGE-positive areas were widely distributed, and not limited to the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Focal LGE at the non-hypertrophic LV segments was found in some ApHCM patients, even without LGE of hypertrophied apical segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over the 2-year follow-up, there was no one achieving the study end-point, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGE was frequently observed not only in the thickened apex of the heart but also in other LV segments, irrespective of the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The simple presence of LGE on CMR was not representative of adverse prognosis in this population </plain></SENT>
