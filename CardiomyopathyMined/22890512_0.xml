<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We present a 4-year-old girl with aHUS who had multiple severe clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was managed with intensive plasma exchange and hemodialysis, which could not halt the progression of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial single dose of eculizumab only temporarily improved the clinical symptoms of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sustained improvement of renal, hematological, and cardiac values were only achieved upon institution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with eculizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During long-term treatment with eculizumab (&gt;2.5Â years), she has had no further clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>, and required neither plasma exchange nor hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> eculizumab treatment was associated with control of complement-mediated <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> and sustained long-term improvement in renal and cardiac function </plain></SENT>
