<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However" surgical treatment for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (STICH)" trial concluded that adding SVR to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not relieve symptoms and failed to lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate or cardiac rehospitalization as compared with CABG alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CABG with SVR for ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 24 patients who had undergone CABG with or with out SVR for ICM from October 1992 to June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CABG with SVR group, cardiac symptoms were relieved and the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) was reduced from the baseline significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However cardiac symptoms were relieved only in CABG-S [left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd)&lt;60 mm] group, and not in CABG-L (LVDdâ‰¥60 mm) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVESVI was not reduced in CABG without SVR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SVR contributed to relieving the symptoms, and improving the left ventricular function and the long-term survival of patients with especially dilated ICM, which could not be achieved by CABG alone </plain></SENT>
