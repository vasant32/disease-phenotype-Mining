<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) has been used for latent cardiac dysfunction in heart patients other than thalassaemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine its role in subclinical detection of iron-induced cardiotoxicity in BTM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: EDTA plasma was taken from 33 thalassaemic patients and 29 healthy controls, stored at -20 degrees C until analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median (range) age of thalassaemic major children was 10 (6-21) years and mean serum ferritin levels were 3956 (1929-6979) microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BTM children had significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher BNP median (range) 83.94 (45.93-196.80) pg/mL as compared to controls 55.62 (32.58-99.84) pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitral E-wave velocities were found higher in patients rather than controls (132.12 +/- 29.40 vs. 117.70 +/- 24.81; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The E/Ea ratio was significantly higher in BTM patients than in the control group (16.35 +/- 6.01 vs. 19.26 +/- 4.67; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a significant positive correlation between BNP and E/Ea ratio (r = 0.53; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BNP at a cut-off value of 84.39 pg/mL was highly accurate in ruling out diastolic dysfunction (E/Ea &lt; 8) with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BNP has a good predictive value in detecting latent LV dysfunction in BTM patients </plain></SENT>
