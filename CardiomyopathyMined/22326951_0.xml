<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism that links <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> is a hallmark feature of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the FoxO family of transcription factors, which regulate cell size, viability, and metabolism, are established targets of insulin and growth factor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we set out to evaluate a possible role of FoxO proteins in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that FoxO proteins were persistently activated in cardiac tissue in mice with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced either genetically or by high-fat diet (HFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FoxO activity was critically linked with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>: cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of FoxO1 rescued HFD-induced declines in cardiac function and preserved cardiomyocyte insulin responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FoxO1-depleted cells displayed a shift in their metabolic substrate usage, from free fatty acids to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, associated with decreased accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that FoxO1-dependent downregulation of IRS1 resulted in blunted Akt signaling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that activation of FoxO1 is an important mediator of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and is a promising therapeutic target for the disease </plain></SENT>
