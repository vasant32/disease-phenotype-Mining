<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is important to identify which patients are at highest early risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether selected blood biomarkers may aid in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied consecutive non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients between November 2006 and January 2007, and selected undetermined origin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn at arrival to test brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP), D-dimer, CK-MB, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi>, and troponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second harmonic transthoracic echocardiography (SHTTE) and ECG-24 h monitoring were also performed within the first 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 294 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; 89 had an initial undetermined origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a cardiological work-up, 49 were diagnosed as embolic including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (4), severe aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> (24), severe wall abnormalities (12), valve disease (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (1), and patent foramen (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of CK-MB, BNP, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> were found in patients with embolic source in SHTTE, but only CK-MB &gt;1.5 ng/ml and BNP &gt;64 pg/ml remained as independent predictors: BNP (OR 8.86; CI 95 % 2.79-28.09), CK-MB (OR 6.28; CI 95 % 1.66-23.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BNP showed specificity of 75 %, sensitivity of 63.4 %, and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 75.6 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CK-MB had specificity of 85 %, sensitivity of 47.9 %, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 79.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measuring both biomarkers improves the finding of embolic source, increasing specificity to 95 % and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> to 88.2 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High-level CK-MB and BNP during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are associated with an embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Measurement of both biomarkers may improve the diagnosis, guiding the need to perform a heart exploration </plain></SENT>
