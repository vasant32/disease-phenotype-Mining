<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The C allele of c.-94C&gt;G polymorphism of the delta-sarcoglycan gene was associated as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> in Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: We evaluated whether the c.-94C&gt;G polymorphism can be a risk factor for HCM in Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: The polymorphism was genotyped and the risk was estimated in 35 HCM patients and 145 healthy unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data of this polymorphism reported in Mexican Amerindian populations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The C allele frequency in HCM patients was higher with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.37, and the risk for the CC genotype increased to 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis with Mexican Amerindian populations showed that the C allele frequency was significantly higher in HCM patients with an OR of 2.96 and for CC genotype the risk increased to 7.60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The C allele of the c.-94C&gt;G polymorphism is a risk factor for HCM, which is increased by the Amerindian component and can play an important role in the etiology and progression of disease in Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
