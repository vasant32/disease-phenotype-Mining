<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and its regulatory partner phospholamban (PLN) are essential for myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arg(9) → Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand these mutations, we made a series of amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN and tested their ability to inhibit SERCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R9C is a complete loss-of-function mutant of PLN, whereas R14del is a mild loss-of-function mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PLN to simulate heterozygous conditions, the mutants had a dominant negative effect on SERCA function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of targeted mutations in this region of the PLN cytoplasmic domain ((8)TRSAIRR(14)) demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic balance in proper PLN regulation of SERCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that Arg(9) → Leu and Thr(8) → Cys substitutions mimicked the behavior of the R9C mutant, and an Arg(14) → Ala substitution mimicked the behavior of the R14del mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that the change in hydrophobicity resulting from the R9C and R14del mutations is sufficient to explain the loss of function and persistent interaction with SERCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hydrophobic imbalance in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN appears to be a predictor for the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
