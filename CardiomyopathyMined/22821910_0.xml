<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many of the families afflicted with either disease, causative mutations have been identified in various sarcomeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we focus on mutations in the cardiac muscle molecular motor, myosin, and its associated light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the &gt;300 identified mutations, there is still no clear understanding of how these mutations within the same myosin molecule can lead to the dramatically different clinical phenotypes associated with HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Localizing mutations within myosin's molecular structure provides insight into the potential consequence of these perturbations to key functional domains of the motor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of biochemical and biophysical data that characterize the functional capacities of these mutant myosins suggests that mutant myosins with enhanced contractility lead to HCM, whereas those displaying reduced contractility lead to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With gain and loss of function potentially being the primary consequence of a specific mutation, how these functional changes trigger the hypertrophic response and lead to the distinct HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> phenotypes will be the future investigative challenge </plain></SENT>
