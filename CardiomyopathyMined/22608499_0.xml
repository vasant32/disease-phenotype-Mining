<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the genetic origin of this condition, we used next-generation exome sequencing to identify mutations in MTO1, which encodes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> translation optimization 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two affected siblings carried a maternal c.1858dup (p.Arg620Lysfs(∗)8) frameshift and a paternal c.1282G&gt;A (p.Ala428Thr) missense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third unrelated individual was homozygous for the latter change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both humans and yeast, MTO1 increases the accuracy and efficiency of mtDNA translation by catalyzing the 5-carboxymethylaminomethylation of the wobble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> base in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, mutant muscle and fibroblasts showed variably combined reduction in mtDNA-dependent respiratory chain activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced respiration in mutant cells was corrected by expressing a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MTO1 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, defective respiration of a yeast mto1Δ strain failed to be corrected by an Mto1(Pro622∗) variant, equivalent to human MTO1(Arg620Lysfs∗8), whereas incomplete correction was achieved by an Mto1(Ala431Thr) variant, corresponding to human MTO1(Ala428Thr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respiratory yeast phenotype was dramatically worsened in stress conditions and in the presence of a paromomycin-resistant (P(R)) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> rRNA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in vivo mtDNA translation was impaired in the mutant yeast strains </plain></SENT>
