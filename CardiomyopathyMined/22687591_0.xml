<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since its first description in the 1950s, the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been clarified by advanced echocardiographic technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved pharmacotherapy now successfully treats most afflicted individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with these advances, surgical management has also evolved, as the role of the mitral valve and the subvalvular structures in causing obstruction has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last 2 decades, a variety of options to surgically manage the complex patient with obstruction have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful surgical management is dependent on the complete evaluation of the causes of obstruction in the specific individual, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> may confound the direction of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement may no longer be necessary in individuals who have a relatively thin septum and instead obstruct from an elongated mitral anterior leaflet or the presence of accessory papillary muscles and chords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Techniques for mitral valve plication have been successfully used with mid- to long-term success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic strategy for the evaluation of obstruction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the various surgical options are summarized in a procedure termed RPR for resection (extended myectomy), plication (mitral valve shortening), and release (papillary muscle manipulation) </plain></SENT>
