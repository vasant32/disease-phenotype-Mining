<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which have the propensity to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> consistently report elevated levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, as well as negative lifestyle changes associated with the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients, young patients face decades of life with the device and the long-term impact and implications are important to consider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This research explores the experiences of adolescents living with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parents of these adolescents were also included to explore the impact on them as the primary caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A qualitative approach was chosen to explore the lived experience; semistructured interviews with six adolescents and six parents were conducted from which a number of key themes emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The experiences described by participants included the restrictions adolescents face, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock experience, and ongoing challenges post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, both adolescents and parents were able to adjust to life after receiving an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and described several benefits associated with having the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings also emerged relating to communication between health professionals and adolescents, and the limitations adolescents impose on themselves post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings have important implications for clinical practice and may help guide medical management for adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> and their families </plain></SENT>
