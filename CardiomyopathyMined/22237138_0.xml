<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively identified 100 consecutive patients presenting in the Auckland region between March 2004 and July 2010 and obtained clinical, laboratory, electrocardiography, echocardiography, coronary angiography and long-term follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>Chest pain</z:hpo> or dyspnoea were the most common presenting symptom, 95% were women (mean age 65 ± 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An associated stressor was identified in two-thirds of patients, troponin was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and one-third had ECG ST-elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a similar range of initial LV ejection fraction (EF), myocardial damage, LV recovery and prognosis in those with and without ST-elevation, and with and without identifiable stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-quarter had a complicated in-hospital course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower admission LVEF, but not peak troponin level or ECG ST-elevation, was associated with a complicated in-hospital course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 3.0 ± 1.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four died late after discharge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from non-cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven had recurrent ABS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this large, prospective, New Zealand ABS cohort a quarter of patients had a complicated in-hospital course, but almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recovered, recurrence was infrequent and long-term prognosis dependent on associated non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
