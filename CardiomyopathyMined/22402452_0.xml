<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Unresponsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) may contraindicate heart transplant since it implies poor early outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study reports the effectiveness of oral perioperative sildenafil in allowing heart transplant candidacy and surgery in a selected group of patients initially deemed ineligible because of PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 2005 and December 2009, 31 consecutive patients (5 females, 9 with a history of idiopatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 16 with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 10 with previous sternotomies, 71.42 ± 27.69 ml/min/m(2) mean pre-operative epidermal growth factor receptor) were qualified for oral sildenafil because of unresponsive PH at baseline right heart catheterization (RHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 12-week trial, RHC disclosed PH reversibility (mean pulmonary vascular resistance index: 9.57 ± 4.07 WU, mean transpulmonary gradient 14.47 ± 5.66 mmHg and mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure: 68.96 ± 15.15 mmHg), allowing <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> despite a higher risk for early post-transplant RV failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplant protocol included donor/recipient size matching ≥0.8 and inhaled nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in the early post-operative period followed by reinstitution of oral sildenafil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean overall graft ischaemic time was 179 ± 47min; mean donor recipient weight ratio was 1.04 ± 0.17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>Right ventricular failure</z:hpo> developed in three patients (9.6%) and hospital mortality was 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protocol RHC disclosed pulmonary haemodynamic profile normalization within the third post-operative month allowing weaning from sildenafil in the 30 hospital survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-year RHC confirmed PH reversal (n = 29 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> who survived up to 1year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot prospective uncontrolled trial suggests that oral sildenafil is effective in allowing candidacy, safe transplantation and post-operative pulmonary profile normalization in potential recipients initially disqualified because of PH </plain></SENT>
