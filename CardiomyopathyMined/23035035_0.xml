<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this relationship represents a cause or consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or is attributed to associated risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated if average leucocyte telomere length is associated with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>) or its severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared average leucocyte telomere length in 223 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> and 227 healthy controls of black African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the relationship between average leucocyte telomere length and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LVEF was determined using echocardiography and radionuclide multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative leucocyte telomere length (T/S) was measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Log T/S was negatively correlated with age in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> (P = 0.0007) and in controls (P = 0.030), and with alcohol consumption (P = 0.032) and regular smoking (P = 0.021) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Log T/S did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> and control groups either before (P = 0.11) or after (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> = 0.071 ± 0.187, control = 0.071 ± 0.187, P = 0.99) adjustments for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Log T/S was not associated with echocardiographic (P = 0.47) or MUGA (P = 0.99) LVEF or LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (P = 0.34) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With adjustments for age, sex, alcohol consumption, and smoking, log T/S was similarly not associated with echocardiographic (P = 0.60) or MUGA (P = 0.91) LVEF or LVEDD (P = 0.53) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Average relative leucocyte telomere length is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> or its severity in groups of black African ancestry </plain></SENT>
