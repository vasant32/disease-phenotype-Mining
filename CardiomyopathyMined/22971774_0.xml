<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These functions are associated with an unusual combination of biochemical activities: tyrosine phosphatase and threonine phosphatase activities in separate domains, and transactivation potential when associated with a DNA-binding partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EYA mutations are linked to multiorgan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e>, as well as to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult diseases</z:e> ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the growing understanding of EYA biochemical and cellular activity, biological function, and association with disease, comes the possibility that the EYA proteins are amenable to the design of targeted therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The availability of structural information, direct links to <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, available animal models, and the fact that they utilize unconventional reaction mechanisms that could allow specificity, suggest that EYAs are well-positioned for drug discovery efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review provides a summary of EYA structure, activity, and function, as they relate to development and disease, with particular emphasis on recent findings </plain></SENT>
