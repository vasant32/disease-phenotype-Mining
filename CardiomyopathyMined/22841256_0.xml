<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although heart transplantation is the best therapy for end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, most candidates die in the waiting period due to the lack of donor organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This condition represent a new era of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with a mean age of 40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assist device (VAD) implantation surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed 69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early mortality was 13.3% with 21 patients after the heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 67 patients supported with VAD did not experience an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (35.8%) are still on pump support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall survival until transplantation or weaning was 77.6% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached 90% with Heartware (Hartware Inc, Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After the introduction of VAD in 2007, the overall picture has been restructured radically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> surgery, reducing patient loss on the waiting list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially, since 2009 nearly 80% of donor hearts were used for patients on mechanical circulatory support </plain></SENT>
