<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to compare the yield of electrocardiographic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) criteria for the diagnosis of LVH and hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in subjects aged &lt;20 years and &gt;30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between the electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for LVH (ECG-LVH) and echocardiographic findings was compared in 4 groups of air force academy candidates: (1) young candidates undergoing echocardiography because of ECG-LVH findings (n = 666); (2) young candidates without ECG-LVH findings undergoing routine echocardiography (n = 4,043); (3) older designated aviators undergoing echocardiography because of ECG-LVH findings (n = 196); and (4) older designated aviators undergoing routine echocardiography without ECG-LVH findings (n = 1,098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of ECG-LVH findings for echocardiographic LVH, left ventricular mass, posterior wall thickness, and interventricular septal thickness were compared among the 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ECG criteria in young subjects correlated with the left ventricular mass and posterior wall thickness but not with the interventricular septal thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In older subjects, these criteria correlated with left ventricular mass, interventricular septal, and posterior wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative predictive value of ECG-LVH findings for the echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH in young subjects was 6.0% and 99.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In older subjects the positive and negative predictive value of ECG-LVH findings was 34% and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ECG criteria are probably a useful tool for exclusion of LVH in young and older subjects; however, their low positive predictive value would probably lead to unnecessary echocardiographic tests, particularly in young subjects </plain></SENT>
