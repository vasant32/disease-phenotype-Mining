<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography indicated excessive contraction limited to the left ventricular apex and akinesis of the basal and middle ventricle, which were confirmed by emergency left ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The finding was diagnostic of inverted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the left adrenal gland with a central low-density area, and the plasma and urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> were strikingly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggested the presence of a hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A myocardial biopsy in the very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage on the day of admission revealed neutrophilic infiltration and contraction-band <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, which was indistinguishable from the previously reported pathology in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> in this case was confirmed 7 weeks later by surgical removal of the left adrenal gland with massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> at the center of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The marked similarity of the endomyocardial pathology between this case and cases with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> strongly points to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> excess as a common causality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
