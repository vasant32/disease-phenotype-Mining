<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A small but important subset of elite male athletes may show a borderline increased LV wall thickness of 13 to 15 mm, which defines a gray zone of overlap between the extreme expressions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e> and a mild HCM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such diagnostic ambiguity can be resolved by using the paradigm of noninvasive parameters including testing with echocardiography (and, more recently, with CMR): left atrial and LV chamber dimensions and shape, brief periods of deconditioning to alter LV mass, measurement of oxygen consumption and diastolic filling, and recognition of familial occurrence of HCM or a pathogenic HCM-causing sarcomere mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such distinctions between physiologic/benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e> and HCM, the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the young in the United States, can be crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recognition of HCM leads to disqualification from intense competitive sports to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> risk and, when appropriate, permits initiation of therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
