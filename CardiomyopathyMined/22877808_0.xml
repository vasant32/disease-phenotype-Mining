<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TRACS sought to describe the clinical outcomes and disease progression of transthyretin (TTR) cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (ATTR) in an observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical course is largely determined by disease type with ATTR categorized as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (ATTRwt) or genetic-variant protein (ATTRm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective data are lacking in the most common TTR mutation, V122I, present in approximately 3.5% of African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with ATTRwt (n = 18) and V122I ATTRm (n = 11) were longitudinally assessed every 6 months for up to 2 years by functional class assessments, biochemical markers, and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, no differences in clinical characteristics, biomarkers, or echocardiographic parameters were noted between patients with ATTRwt and patients with ATTRm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 15.5 ± 8 months, there were 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 1 cardiac transplant, with higher mortality (73% vs 22%, P = .03) and cardiovascular hospitalization (64% vs 28%, P = .02) among patients with ATTRm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival from diagnosis was 25.6 months for ATTRm vs 43.0 months for ATTRwt (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of mortality included disease duration, heart rate ≥ 70 beats/min, baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%, and ATTRm status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each 6-month increment, the mean 6-minute walk distance declined by 25.8 m, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> increased by 1,816 pg/mL, and left ventricular ejection fraction fell by 3.2%, for the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, disease progression, morbidity, and mortality were observed in ATTR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, particularly due to V122I, over a short duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the prevalence of this mutation, further study of V122I in at-risk African American patients is warranted </plain></SENT>
