<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise-induced change in ventricular dyssynchrony may be an important determinant of dynamic changes in cardiac output and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, longitudinal study was designed with pre-defined dyssynchrony index and outcome variables to test the hypothesis that dynamic dyssynchrony is associated with worse long-term event-free survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and 'narrow' QRS complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-hundred eighty patients (62 ± 8 years; 110 males) with NYHA class II-III, idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, ejection fraction ≤35%, and QRS duration &lt;120 ms were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent standard Doppler echo, colour tissue velocity imaging (DTI), and supine bicycle exercise stress echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac synchronicity was defined, at rest and at peak exercise, as DTI velocity opposing-wall delay (significant if ≥65 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was defined as freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, heart transplantation, or LV-assist device implantation, over a median follow-up of 48 months, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used for survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline examination, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients showed a reduced LV ejection fraction (31 + 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant electromechanical delay in 58 patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the peak of physical exercise, a significant electromechanical delay was detected in 103 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 41 events during the follow-up (23%): 28 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 8 heart transplantations, and 5 LV-assist device implantations over 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for confounding baseline variables, LV end-diastolic volume, restrictive mitral flow pattern, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, and the presence of exercise-induced intraventricular dyssynchrony were the only independent determinants of an adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and narrow QRS, the increase in echocardiographic dyssynchrony during exercise was the strongest predictor of less favourable event-free survival </plain></SENT>
