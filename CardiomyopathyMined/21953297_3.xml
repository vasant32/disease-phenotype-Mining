<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long known to be essential for maintaining nuclear structure and disassembling/reassembling during mitosis in metazoans, research over the past dozen years has shown that mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamins, particularly LMNA encoding the A-type lamins, cause a broad range of diverse diseases, often referred to as laminopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lamins are expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian somatic cells but mutations in their genes lead to relatively tissue-selective disease phenotypes in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While mutations causing laminopathies have been shown to produce abnormalities in nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, how these disease-causing mutations or resultant alterations in nuclear structure lead to pathology is only starting to be understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the incomplete understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying the laminopathies, basic research in cellular and small animal models has produced promising leads for treatments of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
