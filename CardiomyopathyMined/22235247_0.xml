<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we employed a comprehensive array of clinically relevant in vivo MRI techniques to identify early markers of cardiac dysfunction and follow disease progression in the hearts of mdx mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial measurements of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function were made in the same group of mdx mice and controls (housed in a non-SPF facility) using MRI at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic function, response to dobutamine stress and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RV dysfunction preceded LV dysfunction, with RV end systolic volumes increased and RV ejection fractions reduced at 3 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV ejection fractions were reduced at 12 months, compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An abnormal response to dobutamine stress was identified in the RV of mdx mice as early as 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI identified increased levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in 6, 9 and 12-month-old mdx mice, the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> correlating with the degree of cardiac remodeling and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI could identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> in the RV of mdx mice as young as 1 month, and detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe these to be the earliest MRI measurements of cardiac function reported for any mice, and the first use of late-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhancement in a mouse model of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These techniques offer a sensitive and clinically relevant in vivo method for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and other diseases </plain></SENT>
