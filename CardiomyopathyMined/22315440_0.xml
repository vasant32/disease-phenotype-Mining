<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Patients with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) exhibit elevated left ventricular outflow tract gradients (LVOTGs) and appear to have a worse prognosis than those with nonobstructive HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with obstruction, compared with nonobstructive HCM, demonstrate significant differences in PET parameters of microvascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PET was performed in 33 symptomatic HCM patients at rest and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> stress (peak) for the assessment of regional myocardial perfusion (rMP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial blood flow (MBF), and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial wall thickness and LVOTG were measured with an echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into the following 3 groups: nonobstructive (LVOTG &lt; 30 mm Hg at rest and after provocation test with amyl <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>), obstructive (LVOTG ≥ 30 mm Hg at rest and with provocation), and latent HCM (LVOTG &lt; 30 at rest but ≥ 30 mm Hg with provocation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were classified as nonobstructive (group 1), 12 as obstructive (group 2), and 10 as latent HCM (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for age (42 ± 18 y for group 1, 58 ± 7 y for group 2, and 58 ± 12 y for group 3; P = 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups had similar baseline characteristics, including maximal wall thickness (2.3 ± 0.5 cm for group 1, 2.2 ± 0.4 cm for group 2, and 2.1 ± 0.7 cm for group 3; P = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During peak flow, most patients in groups 1 and 2, but fewer in group 3, exhibited rMP defects (73% for group 1, 100% for group 2, and 40% for group 3; P = 0.007) and a drop in LVEF (73% for group 1, 92% for group 2, and 50% for group 3; P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peak MBF (1.58 ± 0.49 mL/min/g for group 1, 1.72 ± 0.46 mL/min/g for group 2, and 1.97 ± 0.32 mL/min/g for group 3; P = 0.14) and MFR (1.62 ± 0.57 for group 1, 1.90 ± 0.31 for group 2, and 2.27 ± 0.51 for group 3; P = 0.01) were lower in the nonobstructive and higher in the latent HCM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LVOTGs demonstrated no significant correlation with any flow dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate regression analysis, maximal wall thickness was the only significant predictor for reduced peak MBF (β = -0.45, P = 0.003) and MFR (β = -0.63, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Maximal wall thickness was identified as the strongest predictor of impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>-induced hyperemia and flow reserve in our study, whereas outflow tract obstruction was not an independent determinant </plain></SENT>
