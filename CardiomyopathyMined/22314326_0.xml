<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As 70% of MYBPC3 mutations introduce a premature termination codon, the purpose of the current study was to report the prevalence of large MYBPC3 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large French cohort of 100 HCM patients, for whom no putatively causative point mutations were identified previously in the most prevalent HCM-causing genes, was investigated using an MLPA methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One HCM patient was identified to carry a large MYBPC3 rearrangement (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient presents a 3505-bp deletion, which begins in the intron 27 and ends 485 bp after the MYBPC3 stop codon (g.47309385_47312889del) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was originated by recombination of a 296 bp AluSz sequence located in intron 27 and a 300 bp AluSx sequence located immediately downstream of exon 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study allowed the characterization of the first large MYBPC3 deletion reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it appears that MLPA strategy, that moderates the identification of large MYBPC3 rearrangements, might confirm a clinical diagnosis only in a small number of patients (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
