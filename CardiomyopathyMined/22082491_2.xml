<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Fetal cells enter the maternal circulation during pregnancy and may persist in maternal tissue for decades as microchimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Based on clinical observations of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients and the high rate of recovery they experience from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, our objective was to determine whether fetal cells can migrate to the maternal heart and differentiate to cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report that fetal cells selectively home to injured maternal hearts and undergo differentiation into diverse cardiac lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged fetuses, we demonstrate engraftment of multipotent fetal cells in injury zones of maternal hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, eGFP+ fetal cells form endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, fetal cells isolated from maternal hearts recapitulate these differentiation pathways, additionally forming vascular tubes and beating cardiomyocytes in a fusion-independent manner; â‰ˆ40% of fetal cells in the maternal heart express Caudal-related homeobox2 (Cdx2), previously associated with trophoblast stem cells, thought to solely form placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fetal maternal stem cell transfer appears to be a critical mechanism in the maternal response to cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have identified Cdx2 cells as a novel cell type for potential use in cardiovascular regenerative therapy </plain></SENT>
