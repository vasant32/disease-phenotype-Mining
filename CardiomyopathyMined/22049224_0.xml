<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current theory suggests that C pneumoniae may persist at the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> via an alternative replicative form, known as an aberrant body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A panel of C pneumoniae-specific antibodies upregulated by the aberrant body was used to probe tissue specimens from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264683" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary atheroma</z:e> from 13 explanted hearts to identify patterns of reactivity in these tissues, as well as to determine the presence and prevalence of C pneumoniae aberrant bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 13 patients had an ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, while another six patients had an idiopathic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One additional patient, a young (24 years) woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, had no history of atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were positive by immunohistochemistry with at least one antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronary arteries of the two other patients were negative by immunohistochemistry with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients was the 24-year-old woman with grade I disease and no risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The protein antigens of persistent C pneumoniae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> found in the atheromatous lesions from patients in this study could potentially be used as markers to detect such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and some may be virulence factors or immunogens specific to C pneumoniae, thus serving as target molecules for diagnostic use or therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
