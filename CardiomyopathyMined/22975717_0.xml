<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) has been shown to inversely correlate with left ventricular (LV) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that, in patients with cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, reduced BRS is associated with myocardial remodeling and increased LV mass index (LVMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Eighty-two LC patients scheduled to undergo liver transplantation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectral analysis was done of beat-by-beat blood pressure and heart rate (HR) time series and BRS was derived from their cross-spectral gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography before liver transplantation was used to evaluate heart <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BRS was inversely correlated with LV wall thickness (P=0.038), end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness (P=0.048), LVMI (P=0.005) and HR (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate stepwise linear analysis LVMI and HR were independently associated with BRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On tertile analysis of LVMI, compared with the lowest tertile of LVMI (75±11g/m(2)), the highest tertile (118±13g/m(2)) showed significantly impaired BRS (4.6±2.3 vs. 6.4±3.1ms/mmHg, P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Reduced cardiovagal BRS is associated with increased LV mass in patients with LC, suggesting a relationship between cardiovagal BRS control of HR and cardiac end-organ damage in patients with cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
