<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The constitutional genome is clearly the dominant factor in explaining the striking differences in the pace and patterns of ageing among species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are now in a position to reveal salient features underlying these differential modulations, which are likely to be dominated by regulatory domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, I shall argue that stochastic events are the major players underlying the surprisingly large intra-specific variations in lifespan and healthspan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I shall review well established as well as more speculative categories of chance events--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, protein synthesis error catastrophe and variegations of gene expression (epigenetic drift), with special emphasis upon the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I shall argue that stochastic drifts in variegated gene expression are the major contributors to intra-specific differences in the pace and patterns of ageing within members of the same species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They may be responsible for the quasi-stochastic distributions of major types of geriatric pathologies, including the "big three" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and, via the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They may be responsible for altered stoichiometries of heteromultimeric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> complexes, potentially leading to such disorders as sarcopenia, nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
