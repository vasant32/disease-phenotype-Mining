<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that this therapy is useful in the secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> among patients who have survived arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several trials have also shown the usefulness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in the primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other data support the use of this device for various infiltrative and inherited conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When used with cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have improved survival rates and quality of life in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to examine the potential benefits of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in elderly, female, and hemodialysis-dependent patients, and to determine the optimal waiting period for implantation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, coronary revascularization, and initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart-failure</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
