<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published data on the association between HLA-DR polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> risk are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 case-control studies including 1,378 cases and 10,383 controls provided data on the association between HLA-DR polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, statistically elevated frequencies of HLA-DR4 (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.21-2.07; P=0.0009) and HLA-DR5 (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.05-1.73; P=0.02) alleles were found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with HLA-DR3 antigen have a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.90; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, this meta-analysis indicated that certain HLA-DR alleles may be genetic markers for susceptibility and resistance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
