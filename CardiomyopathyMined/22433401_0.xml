<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate (CP) in the treatment of myocardial damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal asphyxia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical databases were searched for a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized trials on the treatment of myocardial damage with CP following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal asphyxia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data was analyzed using Review Manager 5.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six trials involving 400 patients (CP treatment/control: 202/198) were included in the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis indicated that CP treatment for 7 days decreased serum myocardial enzyme levels (CK, CK-MB, LDH, HBDH and cTnI levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the total effective rate (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.48) and the significantly effective rate (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.41) in the CP treatment group were significantly higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CP treatment reduced the hospitalization period by 4.07 days compared with the control group (95% CI: -5.25, -2.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CP treatment appears to be more effective than routine treatment alone for myocardial damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal asphyxia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears to be safe and it can both decrease serum myocardial enzyme levels and shorten the period of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, as the evidence obtained in this study is not robust due to the poor quality of current studies, further studies of high-quality, large-scale trails are needed </plain></SENT>
