<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE)-derived mitral annular displacement (MAD) utilizes the speckle tracking technique to measure strain vectors, which provides accurate estimates of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated a link between STE-derived MAD and LVEF in patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> and evaluated its clinical usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 266 outpatients and 84 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the study patients, 52 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>), 37 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), 34 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), 74 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (VHD), and 69 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STE continuously tracked annular motion throughout the cardiac cycle in the apical 4- and 2-chamber views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, the curvilinear relationship was found between STE-derived MAD and LVEF (R(2)=0.642) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strong correlation between STE-derived MAD and LVEF was also found in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> (R(2)=0.733, p=0.001) and in those with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (R(2)=0.614, p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, such a correlation was not found in the patients with HCM, VHD, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The specificity in the correlation between STE-derived MAD and LVEF was found in patients with each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, which should be taken into account when assessing these parameters </plain></SENT>
