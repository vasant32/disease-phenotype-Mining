<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have used T2-weighted cardiac MRI to demonstrate the presence of periapical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine the distribution, resolution and correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 32 patients with TTC were evaluated at a median of 2 days after presentation, along with 10 age-matched female controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was quantified both regionally and globally; scanning was repeated in patients with TTC after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations were sought between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and the extent of hypokinesis, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release, release of N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP), and markers of systemic inflammatory activation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and platelet response to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of TTC, T2-weighted signal intensity was greater at the apex than at the base (p&lt;0.0001) but was nevertheless significantly elevated at the base (p&lt;0.0001), relative to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 3 months, T2-weighted signal decreased substantially, but remained abnormally elevated (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regional extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> correlated inversely with radial myocardial strain (except at the apex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were also direct correlations between global T2-weighted signal and (1) plasma normetanephrine (r=0.39, p=0.04) and (2) peak NT-proBNP (r=0.39, p=0.03), but not with systemic inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTC is associated with slowly resolving global myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extent of which correlates with regional contractile disturbance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> release of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
