<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ms1/STARS is a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein that specifically modulates the myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-serum response factor (SRF) regulatory axis within striated muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This ms1/STARS-dependent regulatory axis is of central importance within the cardiac gene regulatory network and has been implicated in cardiac development and postnatal cardiac function/homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dysregulation of ms1/STARS is associated with and causative of pathological cardiac phenotypes, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to gain an understanding of the mechanisms governing ms1/STARS expression in the heart, we have coupled a comparative genomic in silico analysis with reporter, gain-of-function, and loss-of-function approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through this integrated analysis, we have identified three evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs), α, SINA, and DINA, that act as cis-regulatory modules and confer differential cardiac cell-specific activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these ECRs, α and DINA, displayed distinct regulatory sensitivity to the core cardiac transcription factor GATA4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results demonstrate that within embryonic, neonatal, and adult hearts, GATA4 represses ms1/STARS expression with the pathologically associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of GATA4 (type 1/type 2 diabetic models), resulting in ms1/STARS upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This GATA4-dependent repression of ms1/STARS expression has major implications for MRTF-SRF signaling in the context of cardiac development and disease </plain></SENT>
