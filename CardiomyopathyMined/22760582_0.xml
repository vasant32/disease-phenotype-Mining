<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: Advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) is a condition that is rarely thought of in terms of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), like no therapy before them, provide complete decongestion of the left ventricle, with resulting favorable changes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels, from reversal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of cardiomyocytes to recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> geometry and function of the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although not a frequent phenomenon at most institutions, LV recovery is achieved in 20-25Â % of LVAD recipients in some programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with good chances for recovery are usually young, with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and short duration of HF symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After LVAD removal, patients with recovered function remain asymptomatic for years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To reach this level of sustainable restoration of cardiac function, several steps need to be taken: 1) myocardial recovery has to be recognized as a therapeutic goal, especially in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; 2) HF medications have to be restarted and aggressively uptitrated after LVAD implantation; 3) regular monitoring for signs of myocardial recovery (eg, echocardiography or hemodynamics) should become a standard practice in LVAD centers; and 4) weaning protocols should be discussed and accepted at each LVAD program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While some protocols involve extensive several-day testing both at rest and with exercise, others are mostly guided by echocardiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
