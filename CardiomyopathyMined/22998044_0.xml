<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta3-adrenoreceptors (B3AR) are traditionnally known as metabolic receptors in adipose tissue, but came into focus in the cardiovascular field after our demonstration of their expression in human cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, where they mediate endothelium-dependent relaxation of coronary resistance vessels through production of both nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization factor(s) (EDHF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B3AR are also expressed at the plasma membrane of rodent and human cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Notably, their expression is increased in several forms of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, which raises questions about their adaptive or maladaptive role in myocardial remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that they may counteract the adverse effect of B1-B2-AR overactivation, we set out to study the cardiac phenotype of transgenic mice expressing human recombinant B3AR under the cardiac-specifc alpha-MHC promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While exhibiting no prominent phenotype at basal state, these mice seem protected from hypertrophic remodeling under a variety of stresses, without developing left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, this protection seems to depend on a functional nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), as it is abrogated under NOS inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These features can <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be recapitulated in homotypic cardiac myocytes cultures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B3AR transgenic mice were also protected from <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> through a paracrine cross-talk to cardiac fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a beneficial role of B3AR in myocardial remodeling through attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and of excessive cardiac myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, while at the same time optimizing perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As B3AR are resistant to homologous desensitization, they are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sympathetic stimulation, as is prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
