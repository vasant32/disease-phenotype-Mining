<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many experimental and clinical studies investigating the transplantation of cells into the injured myocardium have yielded promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, data from these reports show that transplanted stem cells can engraft within the myocardium, differentiate into major cardiac cell types, and improve cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, results from clinical trials show conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These trials demonstrate significant improvements in cardiac function for up to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these improved functions were diminished when examined at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will discuss the current literature available on cell transplantation, covering studies ranging from animal models to clinical trials </plain></SENT>
