<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding mechanisms underlying titin regulation in cardiac muscle function is of critical importance given recent compelling evidence that highlight titin mutations as major determinants of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously identified a cardiac biomechanical stress-regulated complex at the cardiac-specific N2B region of titin that includes four-and-a-half LIM domain protein-1 (Fhl1) and components of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein signaling cascade, which impacted muscle compliance in Fhl1 knock-out cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, direct regulation of these molecular components in mediating titin N2B function remained unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we identify Fhl1 as a novel negative regulator of titin N2B levels and phosphorylation-mediated mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We specifically identify titin N2B as a novel substrate of extracellular signal regulated-kinase-2 (Erk2) and demonstrate that Fhl1 directly interferes with Erk2-mediated titin-N2B phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We highlight the critical region in titin-N2B that interacts with Fhl1 and residues that are dependent on Erk2-mediated phosphorylation in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also propose a potential mechanism for a known titin-N2B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-causing mutation that involves this regulatory complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies shed light on a novel mechanism regulating titin-N2B mechano-signaling as well as suggest that dysfunction of these pathways could be important in cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> affecting muscle compliance </plain></SENT>
