<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> enzyme CYP2E1 inhibition on <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-induced cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male mice were fed a 4% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> liquid or pair-fed control diet for 6weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following 2weeks of diet feeding, a cohort of mice started to receive the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfide</z:chebi> (100mg/kg/d, i.p.) for the remaining feeding duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiographic and IonOptix systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to evaluate CYP2E1, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), iNOS, the intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory proteins sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, Na(+)Ca(2+) exchanger and phospholamban, pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3, Bax, c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signal-regulating kinase (ASK-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> led to elevated levels of CYP2E1, iNOS and phospholamban, decreased levels of HO-1 and Na(+)Ca(2+) exchanger, cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) defects, <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, overt <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) production, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> accompanied with increased phosphorylation of JNK and ASK-1, the effects were significantly attenuated or ablated by diallyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of JNK and ASK-1 but not HO-1 inducer or iNOS inhibitor obliterated <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-induced cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, substantiating a role for JNK and ASK-1 signaling in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-induced myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> metabolism through CYP2E1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> including myocardial contractile dysfunction, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, possibly through activation of JNK and ASK-1 signaling </plain></SENT>
