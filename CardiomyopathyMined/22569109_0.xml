<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the regulatory role in cardiac function, blood pressure, and electrolyte homeostasis, polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system (RAAS) are candidates for modifying phenotypic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether RAAS polymorphisms modulate HCM phenotype, we selected a large cohort of carriers of one of the three functionally equivalent truncating mutations in the MYBPC3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family-based association analysis was performed to analyze the effects of five candidate RAAS polymorphisms (ACE, rs4646994; AGTR1, rs5186; CMA, rs1800875; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>, rs699; CYP11B2, rs1799998) in 368 subjects carrying one of the three mutations in the MYBPC3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventricular septum (IVS) thickness and Wigle score were assessed by 2D-echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNPs in the RAAS system were analyzed separately and combined as a pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) score for effects on the HCM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the five polymorphisms separately for effects on IVS thickness and Wigle score detected two modest associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the CC genotype in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> gene had less pronounced IVS thickness compared with CT and TT genotype carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DD polymorphism in the ACE gene was associated with a high Wigle score (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was detected between the pro-LVH score and IVS thickness or Wigle score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in contrast to previous studies, in our large study population of HCM patients with functionally equivalent mutations in the MYBPC3 gene we did not find major effects of genetic variation within the genes of the RAAS system on phenotypic expression of HCM </plain></SENT>
