<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare the long-term clinical outcomes of LV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> using current therapeutics, anticoagulation, operative treatment, and antiplatelet agents and to identify independent predictors of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>.Methods: We screened 86,374 patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> in the electronic medical records and imaging databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records of 62 patients with LV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, diagnosed between May 2003 to November 2011, were comprehensively reviewed regarding baseline characteristics, imaging data and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> outcomes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and treatment complications by treatment group.Results: The majority (80.6%) had ischemic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> developed in 18 patients; 8 (45%) were post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> while 10 events occurred before treatment began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred in the operative treatment group; in contrast, 7 post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> occurred in anticoagulation group (17%) (Log rank p= 0.175) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HR 61.30, p= 0.001), previous cerebrovascular events (HR 7.06, p= 0.042), female gender (HR 7.11, p= 0.031), and echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (HR 1.15, p= 0.047).Conclusions: In this study, the rate of post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was not significantly different among the treatment groups; however, operative treatment tended towards less post-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> than other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
