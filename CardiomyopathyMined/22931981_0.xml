<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the non-invasive golden standard to measure myocardial deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler Imaging can be used to assess myocardial deformity, however, it has the limitation of angle-dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to compare left ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> and strains measured by velocity-vector imaging (VVI) using echocardiography (echo-VVI) and MRI (MRI-VVI), and to validate them against harmonic phase tagged MRI (HARP MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total number of 34 subjects (14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 20 patients) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apical and basal image of left ventricular short axis view were acquired for measurements of apical and basal rotation, circumferential and radial strain using both echo-VVI and MRI-VVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An apical four-chamber view was obtained for measuring the distance between the apical and basal levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlations of segmental rotations, circumferential and radial strains were high between echo-VVI and HARP MRI, while the agreement of apical rotation was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> showed much better correlation and agreement between echo-VVI and HARP MRI than apical rotation: the coefficient was 0.97, P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between MRI-VVI and HARP MRI in quantifying rotational parameters and strains was similar with echo-VVI and HARP MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echo-VVI could discriminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysfunctional ventricles on either hypertensive or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data from this study show that (1) it is feasible to quantify left ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> and myocardial strain using echo-VVI and MRI-VVI in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, patients with left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005185'>global systolic dysfunction</z:hpo> and segment systolic dysfunction; (2) the agreement among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mechanical parameters derived from echo-VVI, MRI-VVI, and HARP MRI remained with clinically acceptable ranges </plain></SENT>
