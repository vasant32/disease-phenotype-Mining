<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The French dystrophinopathy database provided clinical, histochemical and molecular data of 278 DMD patients (mean longitudinal follow-up: 14.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on mutation identification in the DMD gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups were defined according to the age at ambulation loss: before 8 years (group A); between 8 and 11 years (group B); between 11 and 16 years (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Motor and respiratory declines were statistically different between the three groups, as opposed to heart involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When acquired, running ability was lost at the mean age of 5.41 (group A), 7.11 (group B), 9.19 (group C) years; climbing stairs ability at 6.24 (group A), 7.99 (group B), 10,42 (group C) years, and ambulation at 7.10 (group A), 9.25 (group B), 12.01 (group C) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary growth stopped at 10.26 (group A), 12.45 (group B), 14.58 (group C) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, forced vital capacity decreased at the rate of 8.83 (group A), 7.52 (group B), 6.03 (group C) percent per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>Phenotypic variability</z:hpo> did not rely on specific mutational spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Beside the most common form of DMD (group B), we provide detailed description on two extreme clinical subgroups: a severe one (group A) characterized by early severe motor and respiratory decline and a milder subgroup (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to group B or C, four to six times fewer patients from group A are needed to detect the same decrease in disease progression in a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
