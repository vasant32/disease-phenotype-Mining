<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DD develops due to mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a family exhibiting the clinical phenotype comprising of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular pre-excitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> in two male patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> in a female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of DD in this family was based on the assessment of the clinical phenotypes and the absence of LAMP2 in skeletal and/or cardiac muscle biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the LAMP2 gene and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> revealed a novel LAMP2 mutation (c.940delG) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of the female patient's cardiomyocytes were LAMP2 positive apparently due to the unfavorable skewing of X chromosome inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further performed qualitative LAMP2 immunohistochemistry on peripheral white blood cells using the smear technique and revealed the absence of LAMP2 in the male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LAMP2 expression was further assessed in granulocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD20+ B lymphocytes, CD14+ monocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells by quantitative polychromatic flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas the male DD patients lacked LAMP2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> WBC populations, the female patient expressed LAMP2 in 15.1% and 12.8% of monocytes and granulocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAMP2 expression ratiometrics of highly vs. weakly expressing WBC populations discriminated the DD patients from the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WBCs are thus suitable for initial LAMP2 expression testing when DD is a differential diagnostic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, flow cytometry represents a quantitative method to assess the skewing of LAMP2 expression in female heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because LAMP2 is a major protein constituent of the membranes of a number of lysosome-related organelles, we also tested the exocytic capacity of the lytic granules from CD8+ T lymphocytes in the patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The degranulation triggered by a specific stimulus (anti-CD3 antibody) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this process can be considered LAMP2 independent in human T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The c.940delG mutation results in a putatively truncated protein (p.A314QfsX32), which lacks the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LAMP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We tested whether this variant becomes exocytosed because of a failure in targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Western blotting of cardiac muscle, WBCs and cultured skin fibroblasts (and their culture media) showed no intra- or extracellular truncated LAMP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By comparing the expression pattern and intracellular targeting in cultured skin fibroblasts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LAMP2 isoforms (A, B and C) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the A314Qfs32-GFP fusion, we found that the A314Qfs32-GFP protein is not even expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the truncated protein is unstable and is co-translationally or early post-translationally degraded </plain></SENT>
