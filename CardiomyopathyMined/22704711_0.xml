<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 2007, the Texas legislature appropriated money for a pilot study to evaluate cardiovascular screening of student athletes to identify those who might be at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> using a questionnaire, physical examination, electrocardiography, and limited echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine (1) the feasibility of a state-wide cardiovascular screening program, (2) the ability to reliably identify at-risk subjects, and (3) problems in implementing screening state wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using established pediatric electrocardiographic and echocardiographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive results were confirmed by a blinded reviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 31 venues (2,506 students), the electrocardiographic findings met the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in 57 (2.3%), with 33 changes suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo>, and 3 with potential ischemic findings related to a coronary anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 2,051 echocardiograms, 11 had findings concerning for disease (9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with electrocardiographic findings consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, the limited echocardiograms were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 24 of 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 who remained at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> on the electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, 25 (65.8%) pursued the recommended evaluation, which confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> in 7, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement was 100% for electrocardiography and 79% for echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire identified 895 (35% of the total) potentially at-risk students, with disease confirmed in 11 (1.23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this large state-funded project, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic screening identified 11 of 2,506 patients potentially at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire was of limited value and had a large number of false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variation was significant for echocardiography and might create problems with limited echocardiographic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, many subjects with abnormal screening results declined a follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
