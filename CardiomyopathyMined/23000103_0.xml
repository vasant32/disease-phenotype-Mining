<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disease is caused by a homozygous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> trinucleotide repeat expansion in the frataxin gene (chromosome 9q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One untoward effect of frataxin deficiency is the lack of iron (Fe)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive remodeling of the heart in FA, however, may be more specifically related to sarcoplasmic Fe overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Fe-containing inclusions in a small percentage of cardiomyocytes may not represent purely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> accumulation of the metal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to re-examine the contribution of Fe to cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, fiber <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, using a combination of X-ray fluorescence, slide histochemistry of Fe, and immunohistochemistry of 2 Fe-related proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">Polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>-embedded human cardiac tissues from the left and right ventricular walls, ventricular septum, right atrium, and atrial septum were studied using qualitative and quantitative X-ray fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissues were recovered from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> matrix, re-embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for visualization of Fe, ferritin, and ferroportin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>X-ray fluorescence showed quantifiable levels of Fe and zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regions of significantly increased Fe (1 to 4 mm(2)) were irregularly distributed throughout the working myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fe granules were sparse in conductive tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Zinc signals remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Robust cytosolic ferritin reaction product occurred in many fibers of the affected regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ferroportin displayed no response except in fibers with advanced Fe overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These observations are at variance with the concept of selective Fe overload only in cardiac mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Fe-mediated damage to cardiomyocytes and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> are more likely due to cytosolic Fe excess </plain></SENT>
