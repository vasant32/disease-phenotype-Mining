<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) compliance is an important determinant of LV function and can be affected by a variety of cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, diastolic dysfunction is associated with altered LV compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the evaluation of LV compliance is complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) allows a direct, accurate evaluation of LV compliance, it requires invasive measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of noninvasive estimation of the EDPVR as a tool to evaluate LV compliance using three-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight subjects were studied, including 23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 22 patients with increased LV compliance due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 23 patients with reduced LV compliance secondary to isolated diastolic dysfunction as defined using current American Society of Echocardiography guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EDPVR was calculated for each subject using a nonlinear model with echocardiographic estimates of end-diastolic pressure and volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both the isolated diastolic dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> groups, predicted end-diastolic volumes at predetermined pressure values (5, 10, 20, and 30 mm Hg) were compared with values in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, noninvasive estimates of the EDPVR resulted in predicted end-diastolic volumes that were lower in the isolated diastolic dysfunction group and higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> group (P &lt; .0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four pressure levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a stepwise trend of decreased compliance was noted for the different grades of diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasive estimation of the LV EDPVR and its ability to differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from <z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>abnormal LV</z:mp> compliance using three-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
