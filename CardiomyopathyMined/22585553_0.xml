<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities at different steps of this signaling cascade result in neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes, or the RASopathies, a group of disorders with overlapping yet distinct phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RASopathy patients have variable degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>poor growth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004482'>relative macrocephaly</z:hpo>, ectodermal abnormalities, dysmorphic features, and increased risk for certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> exists for many of the RASopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, these diseases were thought to be inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, recently patients with defects in two components of this pathway and overlapping features of various forms of Noonan syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> 1 and have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we present a patient with severe, progressive neonatal HCM, elevated urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> metabolites, and dysmorphic features in whom we identified a known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">LEOPARD syndrome</z:e>-associated PTPN11 mutation (c.1403 C &gt; T; p.T468M) and a novel, potentially pathogenic missense SOS1 variant (c.1018 C &gt; T; p.P340S) replacing a rigid nonpolar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29342">imino</z:chebi> acid with a polar amino acid at a highly conserved position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We describe detailed clinical manifestations, cardiac histopathology, and the molecular genetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oligogenic models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> with potential synergistic effects should be considered in the RASopathies </plain></SENT>
