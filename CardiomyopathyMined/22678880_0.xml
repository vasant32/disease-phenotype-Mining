<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications are currently described mostly in the form of case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sampled a population of affected individuals in order to estimate the frequency of complications amongst the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study is a cross-sectional retrospective review with a survey instrument and recruitment through the Propionic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>Acidemia</z:hpo> Foundation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses for 58 individuals were tabulated for each question as how frequently the complication was reported among responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Commonly reported findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Developmental and cognitive disabilities were reported in the majority of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was reported in over half of deceased individuals at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>Pancreatitis</z:hpo> was reported in a minority of the sample, yet more than half of these reported a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results update and extend our current knowledge of recognized complications among individuals with PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results also provide new information regarding developmental outcomes and previously unreported morbidity from cardiac and gastrointestinal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies exploring associated biochemical and clinical parameters are necessary to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of PA and its complications </plain></SENT>
