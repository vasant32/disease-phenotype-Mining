<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously it has been shown that various types of hypertrophic and dilative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (hCMP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">dCMP</z:chebi>) can be attributed to disturbed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies described mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA-located genes encoding for subunits of respiratory chain complexes, including the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi> gene (MT-CYB), causing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study the MT-CYB gene was analysed in 30 patients with hCMP, 40 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">dCMP</z:chebi>, and 50 controls for alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 27 MT-CYB variants were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of them were single nucleotide polymorphisms defining common haplogroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variant m.15434C&gt;A was found in a single patient with severe <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">dCMP</z:chebi> and assessed as novel mutation, since it was not found in healthy controls or available data sets, and was nonhaplogroup associated with Phylotree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This variant altered an amino acid (L230I) with a high interspecific amino acid conservation index (CI = 97.7%) indicative of the functional importance of the residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Though the L230I mutation seems to play a causative role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">dCMP</z:chebi>, prospective studies on yeast or transgenic mice models with defined mutation are warranted to study the pathogenetic impact of this mutation </plain></SENT>
