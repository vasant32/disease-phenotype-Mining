<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: To evaluate supplement use, most notably ephedra, which has been temporally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal models suggest increased myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> may predispose to primary arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Clinical, pathological, and investigative records from the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner's Cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Registry were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight cases of those with known supplement use were compared to 144 age-, gender-, and socioeconomic-matched controls in a 1:3 case:control manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Of the 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> temporally associated with supplement use, the mean age was 34.2 ± 10.0 years and predominantly male (n = 44, 91.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was fatal atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> in 18 (37.5%), sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 16 (33.3%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in six (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, there were no statistically significant differences in adjudicated cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On autopsy, there were no differences in cardiac mass, ventricular wall thickness, or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in those known to be taking identified supplements compared to a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subject ≥35 years, and known to be taking supplements, there was a significant increase in causality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as due to sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (relative risk = 5.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-18.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Active surveillance of mortality in an autopsy-derived series of young adults finds atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> are common etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when taking supplements, but no cardiac structural or histologic mechanism to suggest different pathologic process than a matched control population </plain></SENT>
