<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associates with mutations in the SCN5A gene, but the frequency, phenotype, and causative nature of these associations remain the focus of ongoing investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1991, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> probands and family members have been enrolled in the Familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry and extensively evaluated by clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> samples from 338 individuals among 289 DCM families were obtained and screened for SCN5A mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 5 missense SCN5A mutations among our <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> families, including novel mutations E446K, F1520L, and V1279I, as well as previously reported mutations D1275N and R222Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 15 SCN5A mutation carriers in our study, 14 (93%) manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (13 of 15), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (5 of 15) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (9 of 15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (5 of 15), and conduction disease (9 of 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in SCN5A were detected in 1.7% of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds (6 of 9) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutations in SCN5A localize to the highly conserved homologous S3 and S4 transmembrane segments, suggesting a shared mechanism of disruption of the voltage-sensing mechanism of this channel leading to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, SCN5A mutation carriers show a strong arrhythmic pattern that has clinical and diagnostic implications </plain></SENT>
