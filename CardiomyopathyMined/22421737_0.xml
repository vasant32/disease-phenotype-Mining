<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In line with this notion, the homozygous loss of MLP results in <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> such as aortic banding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We thus hypothesized that overexpression of MLP might change the hypertrophic response to cardiac stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to answer the question whether MLP modulates <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> in vivo, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of MLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three independent transgenic lines did not show a pathological phenotype under baseline conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, contractile function and heart weight to body weight ratios at different ages were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, the transgenic animals were challenged with pressure overload due to aortic constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, transgenic mice developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> to the same extent as their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neither contractile dysfunction nor pathological gene expression in response to pressure overload were differentially affected by MLP overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a milder in vivo model of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi>, cardiac mass and hypertrophic gene expression were again identical in MLP transgenic mice and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we provide evidence that cardiac overexpression of MLP does not modulate the heart's response to various forms of pathological stress </plain></SENT>
