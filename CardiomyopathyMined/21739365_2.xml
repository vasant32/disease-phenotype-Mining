<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increases in the activities of proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, calpains, cathepsins, and caspases contribute to the process of cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to modifying the extracellular matrix, both matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins have been shown to affect the activities of subcellular organelles in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activation of calpains and caspases has been identified to induce subcellular remodeling in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic activities associated with different proteins including caspases, calpain, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been shown to be involved in cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which is an integral part of cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article discusses and compares how the activities of various proteases are involved in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> with respect to alterations in apoptotic pathways, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An imbalance appears to occur between the activities of some proteases and their endogenous inhibitors in various types of hypertrophied and failing hearts, and this is likely to further accentuate subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of inhibiting the activities of both extracellular and intracellular proteases specific to distinct etiologies, in attenuating cardiac remodeling and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as biochemical changes of subcellular organelles, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> has been emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that combination therapy to inhibit different proteases may prove useful for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
