<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenetic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum response factor (SRF) is a cardiac-enriched transcription regulator controlling the expression of a variety of target genes, including those involved in the contractile apparatus and immediate early response, as well as microRNAs that silence the expression of cardiac regulatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockout of SRF in the heart results in downregulation of cardiac contractile gene expression and development of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to understand the role of SRF in enterovirus-induced cardiac dysfunction and progression to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we report that SRF is cleaved following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enteroviral infection</z:e> of mouse heart and cultured cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cleavage is accompanied by impaired cardiac function and downregulation of cardiac-specific contractile and regulatory genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation by antibody <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that SRF cleavage occurs at the region of its transactivation domain through the action of virus-encoded protease 2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that cleavage of SRF dissociates its transactivation domain from DNA-binding domain, resulting in the disruption of SRF-mediated gene transactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to loss of functional SRF, finally we report that the N-terminal fragment of SRF cleavage products can also act as a dominant-negative transcription factor, which likely competes with the native SRF for DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a mechanism by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> impairs heart function and may offer a new therapeutic strategy to ameliorate myocardial damage and progression to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
