<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nearly 30% of infected patients develop life-threatening complications, and with a latency of 10-30Â years, mostly Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> which is currently the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America, enormously burdening economic resources and dramatically affecting patients' social and labor situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of increasing migration, international tourism and parasite transfer by blood contact, intrauterine transfer and organ transplantation, Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> could potentially become a worldwide problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To raise awareness of this problem, we reflect on the epidemiology and etiopathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, particularly Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To counteract Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, in addition to the general interruption of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> cycle and chemotherapeutic elimination of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> agent, early and effective causal or symptomatic therapies would be indispensable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prerequisites for this are improved knowledge of the pathogenesis and optimized patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From economic and logistics viewpoints, this last prerequisite should be performed using laboratory medicine tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we first summarize the mechanisms that have been suggested as driving Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, mainly those associated with the presence of autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors; secondly, we indicate new treatment strategies involving autoantibody apheresis and in vivo autoantibody neutralization; thirdly, we present laboratory medicine tools such as autoantibody estimation and heart marker measurement, proposed for diagnosis, risk assessment and patient guidance and lastly, we critically reflect upon the increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers in Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
