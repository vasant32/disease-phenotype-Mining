<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effects of gender and levels of social support on 1-year functional health outcomes in older persons diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persons ≥ 65 years of age with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF exacerbation (164 females; 271 males) were enrolled and followed for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants completed baseline and 12-month questionnaires containing clinical and demographic descriptive information and validated self-report measures of: (1) physical functioning (Medical Outcome Study [MOS] SF12 and Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire [KCCQ]) and (2) social support (MOS- Social Support Survey) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women were more likely to be single, widowed or divorced, living alone and earning less annual income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, women reported significantly lower support and physical function scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at 1 year there were no significant gender differences in the proportion of men or women who experienced clinically meaningful functional decline or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> across the year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable modeling, men with lower levels of social support were more likely to experience functional decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was not the case for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that gender-directed strategies to promote optimization of function for both men and women living with HF in their community are warranted </plain></SENT>
