<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dramatic departures from time-honored advanced cardiac life support therapies, such as cardiocerebral resuscitation and bundled post-arrest care, have given rise to a new paradigm of resuscitation practices, which has boosted the rate of neurologically intact survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the pathophysiology of the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> syndrome, the collective pathophysiology after return of spontaneous circulation, and presents management pearls specifically for the emergency physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This growing area of scientific inquiry must be managed appropriately to sustain improved outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The emergency physician must understand this pathophysiology, manage resuscitated patients according to the latest evidence, and coordinate with appropriate inpatient resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> care is predicated on a chain of survival that spans the spectrum of care from the prehospital arena through the emergency, intensive, and inpatient settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The emergency physician is a crucial link in this chain </plain></SENT>
