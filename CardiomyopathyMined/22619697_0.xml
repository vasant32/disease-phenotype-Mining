<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, this study has been initiated to investigate the preventive effect of the iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> (DFX), against DOX-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiotoxicity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were divided into four groups and were injected intraperitoneally (I.P.) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg), a single dose of DFX (250 mg/kg) and a combined treatment with DFX (250 mg/kg) 30 min prior to a single dose of DOX, (15 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single dose of DOX significantly increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TGF-β, Smad2, Smad4, CDKN2A and p53 and significantly decreased Samd7 and Mdm2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of DFX prior to DOX resulted in a complete reversal of DOX-induced alteration in cardiac enzymes and gene expression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from this study suggest that (1) DOX induces its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiotoxicity secondary to increasing genes expression of TGF-β/Smad pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) DOX increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through upregulation of CDKN2A and p53 and downregulation of Mdm2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) The preventive effect of DFX against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated via the TGF-β1/Smad pathway </plain></SENT>
