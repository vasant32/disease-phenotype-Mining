<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>, OMIM 301500) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Males and females exhibit severe organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of otological symptoms was recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric and retrospective study of twenty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (13 families; seven males and 18 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent audiological assessment before initiation and during enzyme replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analysed neurologic heart and kidney status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients (80%; 13 females and seven males) complained of otologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Audiological evaluation showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in 17 patients, bilateral in 16 out of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vestibular examination showed a functional impairment in two patients (one female, one male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlations were found between hearing loss and either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (73,3%), neurological complications (100%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (56%; seven females, seven males) received enzyme replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement or stabilization of the audiological evaluation was reported in seven patients, whereas worsening was observed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high frequency of audiological involvements in females and males with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that the frequency of hearing loss is increased in the presence of renal or neurologic involvement or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is no clinically significant efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy on hearing function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the pathophysiology remains unknown, a vascular mechanism responsible of the inner ear involvement seems to be privileged </plain></SENT>
