<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the ratio of early transmitral velocity to tissue Doppler mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e') is a powerful predictor of adverse outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its prognostic value remains to be established in the setting of Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of E/e' on mortality according to different degrees of left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study prospectively enrolled 232 patients (143 men) with Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (mean age, 48 Â± 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>End points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, 107 patients had an adverse cardiac event, with an overall events rate of 13.2/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model was used with New York Heart Association functional class, LV ejection fraction, right ventricular function, indexed left atrial volume, E/e' ratio, and the statistical interaction term between E/e' ratio and LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of E/e' ratio on mortality depended on the degree of LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increasing E/e' ratio was a strong predictor of outcome in patients with mild to moderate LV dysfunction but was inversely associated with mortality in patients with severe systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the role of the interaction between LV ejection fraction and E/e' ratio in predicting prognosis in Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The E/e' ratio had a stronger prognostic value in patients with mild and moderate LV dysfunction and was inversely associated with mortality in patients with advanced systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
