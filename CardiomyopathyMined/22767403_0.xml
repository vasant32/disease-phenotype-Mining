<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AMPK rapidly senses energy deprivation and orchestrates a metabolic response to maintain an acceptable energy level required for cell survival under such adverse condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its protective role during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> has been deeply documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been shown that the role of AMPK extends to several nonmetabolic effects related to other cardiac pathologies comprising diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we briefly review the different roles played by AMPK in the control of cardiac metabolism and function under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential cardioprotective actions of AMPK and the relative importance of its energetic and nonmetabolic effects in these mechanisms are deeply discussed </plain></SENT>
