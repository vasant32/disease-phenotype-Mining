<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have compared HCM phenotypes and survival according to breed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare epidemiological characteristics, clinical findings, left ventricular (LV) geometric patterns, and survival in several breeds of cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Three hundred and forty-four cats from 5 different breeds (Persian, Domestic <z:mp ids='MP_0000417'>Shorthair</z:mp> [DS], Sphynx, Maine coon [MC], and Chartreux) with primary HCM diagnosed by conventional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cats were classified according to breed and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age at the time of diagnosis was lower (P &lt; .001) in MC (median age, 2.5 years) and Sphynx (3.5 years) than in other breeds (OB), ie, 8.0, 8.0, and 11.0 years for DS, Chartreux, and Persians, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LV outflow tract obstruction was higher (P &lt; .001) in Persians (23/41; 56%) than in OB (115/303; 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age at the first cardiac event was lower (P &lt; .01) in MC (median age, 2.5 years) than in OB (7.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cats surviving &gt; 15 years of age were DS, Persians, or Chartreux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> (representing 24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) was observed only in 3 breeds (DS, MC, and Sphynx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: As in humans, feline HCM is characterized by marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> with several breed-dependent features regarding epidemiology, LV geometric patterns, and clinical course (ie, age at diagnosis, 1st cardiac event, and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
