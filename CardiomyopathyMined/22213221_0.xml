<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several mutations in distinct genes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding for sarcomeric proteins, have been reported in unrelated kindreds with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (FHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified nine individuals from three families harboring two distinct mutations in one copy of the β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of the mutant β-myosin protein isoform, isolated from slow-twitch fibers of skeletal muscle, was demonstrated by Northern and Western blot analysis; this myosin showed a decreased in vitro motility activity and produced a lower actin-activated ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isometric tension, measured in single slow-twitch fibers isolated from the affected individuals, also showed a significant decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of impairment of β-myosin function, as well as the loss in isometric tension development, were strictly dependent on the amount of the isoform transcribed from the mutated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a strong correlation was also demonstrated between mutant β-myosin content and clinical features of FHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we were unable to detect any correlation between mutant β-myosin expression and degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, thereby strengthening the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, one of the hallmarks of FHC, might not necessarily be related to the clinical evolution of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings lend support to the notion that additional factors rather than the mutated gene may play a pathogenetic role in cardiac wall thickening, whereas the prognosis appears to be strongly related to the amount of mutant protein </plain></SENT>
