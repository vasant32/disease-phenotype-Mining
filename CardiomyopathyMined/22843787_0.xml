<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present analysis was to use the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry (PCMR) to analyze outcomes of childhood RCM, with focus on the impact of phenotype comparing 'pure' RCM to cases with additional features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the PCMR database (1990-2008; N=3375) for cases of RCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were defined as 'pure' when RCM was the only assigned diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional documentation of HCM at any time was used as the criteria for RCM/HCM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RCM accounted for 4.5% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 101 (66%), pure RCM was diagnosed; in 51 (34%) there was mixed phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis was not different between groups, but 10% of the pure RCM group was diagnosed in infancy versus 24% of RCM/HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was comparable between groups with 1, 2, and 5 year survival of RCM 82, 80, 68% versus RCM/HCM 77, 74, 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transplant-free survival was 48, 34, 22% and 65, 53, and 43% respectively (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors at diagnosis for lower transplant-free survival were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HR 2.20, P=0.005), lower fractional shortening z-score (HR 1.12 per 1 SD decrease in z-score, P=0.014) and higher posterior wall thickness in the RCM/HCM group only (HR 1.32, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, outcomes were worse than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transplant-free survival is poor for RCM in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival is independent of phenotype; however, the RCM/HCM phenotype has significantly better transplant-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION INFORMATION: clinicaltrials.gov; Identifier: NCT00005391 </plain></SENT>
