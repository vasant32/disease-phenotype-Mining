<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations are dominated by progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of skeletal muscle throughout the clinical spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the classic infantile form is characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: In a cross-sectional single-centre study we clinically assessed 3 patients with classic infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">Pompe disease</z:e> and 39 patients with non-classic presentations, measured their acid alpha-glucosidase activities and analysed their GAA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Classic infantile patients had nearly absent residual enzyme activities and a typical clinical course with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> until the beginning of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease manifestations in non-classic patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a broad variability in the decline of locomotive and respiratory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> ranged from birth to late adulthood and correlated with enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis revealed as many as 33 different mutations, 14 of which are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> classic infantile patients had two severe mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common mutation in the non-classic group was c.-32-13T&gt;G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was associated with a milder course in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Disease manifestation strongly correlates with the nature of the GAA mutations, while the variable progression in non-classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">Pompe disease</z:e> is likely to be explained by yet unknown modifying factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first comprehensive dataset on the clinical course and the mutational spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017921" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AMD">Pompe disease</z:e> in Germany </plain></SENT>
