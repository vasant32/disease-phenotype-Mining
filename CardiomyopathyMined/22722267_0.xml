<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Limited data are available regarding Holter monitoring for cardiovascular events except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> as a risk marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine Holter findings in relation to the long-term prognosis in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulatory Holter monitoring was performed in 106 HCM patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were prospectively followed for the composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiovascular events occurred in 19 patients during a mean follow-up of 10.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> information nor autonomic information as assessed by heart rate variability and turbulence significantly differed between HCM patients with and without cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average heart rates were lower in HCM patients with cardiovascular events (64.7 ± 11.2 beats/min) than in those without (73.7 ± 10.2 beats/min, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after adjustment for baseline characteristics showed that lower average heart rate remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular events (HR: 0.47 per 10 increase; 95% CI: 0.25-0.87; p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Average heart rate on Holter monitoring predicted long-term prognosis in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further multicenter studies are needed to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
