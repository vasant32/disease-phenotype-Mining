<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen cases of HCM, 15 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and 20 cases of traffic accidents were selected as HCM group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> group and control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collagen volume fraction and osteopontin expression were observed and compared by HE staining, Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging and statistical methods were used for quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Collagen volume fraction in left ventricle of HCM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> were significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), which was not significantly different between the HCM group and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integral light density value of osteopontin in left ventricular cardiomyocytes of the HCM group and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> group were significantly higher than that of the control group (P&lt; 0.05), and the value of the HCM group was also significantly higher than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased contents of collagen fibers and the overexpression of osteopontin may play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, and they can be used as markers in aid of diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> due to HCM </plain></SENT>
