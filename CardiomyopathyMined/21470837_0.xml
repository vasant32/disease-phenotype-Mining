<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: A decoy receptor for advanced glycation end product (soluble RAGE or sRAGE) is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> myocardial damage in experimental models and observational studies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> support the hypothesis that sRAGE attenuates the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since sRAGE accumulates in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) we studied the relationship between plasma sRAGE with LVH in CKD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 142 patients with an average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 32 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 49 healthy control individuals matched for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma sRAGE was significantly higher in CKD patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse relationships were found between sRAGE with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and mean wall thickness (MWT) but no such associations were found in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A bootstrap re-sampling validation study confirmed the estimates of the link between sRAGE and these variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On covariance analysis, the slopes of LVMI and MWT to sRAGE were significantly steeper in CKD patients than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression analysis 1 log unit increase in sRAGE was associated with a 82% decrease in the odds for LVH in CKD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sRAGE is an inverse marker of LVH in CKD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association generates the hypothesis that the RAGE pathway could be a causal risk factor for LVH in this population and that blockade of this pathway by the endogenous decoy receptor sRAGE could attenuate LVH in the same population </plain></SENT>
