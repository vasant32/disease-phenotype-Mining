<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous series have predominantly described patients with the TTR variant Val30Met (V30M), which is the most prevalent cause of FAP worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the dominant cardiac phenotype and outcome of FAP associated with TTR Thr60Ala (T60A), the most common UK variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients with FAP associated with TTR T60A (FAP T60A) were prospectively evaluated in two centres between 1992 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median (range) age of symptom development was 63 (45-78) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was present in only 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autonomic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> were present in 44 and 32 patients, respectively, at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement was evident on echocardiography at diagnosis in 56 patients, but was associated with reduced QRS voltages on electrocardiography in only 16% evaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients received implantable anti-arrhythmic devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 6.6 years following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and 3.4 years from diagnosis, and correlated with serum N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) concentration and certain echocardiographic parameters at the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), performed to eliminate the predominant hepatic source of variant TTR T60A protein, was performed in eight patients including one who received a concomitant cardiac transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> progressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lone OLT recipients, of whom four died within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is almost always present at diagnosis in FAP T60A, and is a major determinant of its poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Outcome of liver transplantation in FAP T60A has been discouraging </plain></SENT>
