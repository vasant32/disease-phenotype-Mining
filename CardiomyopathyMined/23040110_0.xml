<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myocardial recovery is more evident in recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ROCM); however, the prevalence of BTR in this subset has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the use of LVAD support for subjects with ROCM in the Intervention in <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>Myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 2 (IMAC2) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall cohort (n = 373) was 38% female, 21% black, with a mean age of 45 ± 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LVAD support was used in 3.8% (n = 14, 43% female, age 32 ± 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of LVAD subjects, 57% (8/14) were BTR, including 73% (8/11) of subjects with symptoms ≤4 months at the time of support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was smaller in BTR than nonrecovered (NR) subjects (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was more common in BTR (75% versus 0%, P = .005), whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was less evident (25% versus 100%, P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of BTR subjects, 7/8 (87.5%) were alive and free of transplant with median follow-up of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a multicenter registry of ROCM, BTR was common and occurred in the majority of subjects requiring LVAD support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology and LVEDD may assist in predicting potential for BTR in ROCM </plain></SENT>
