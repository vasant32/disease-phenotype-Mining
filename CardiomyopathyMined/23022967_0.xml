<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the real world, patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> who show signs and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> should undergo a thorough diagnostic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides clinical and echocardiographic assessment, coronary angiography is the most important and common examination performed to detect or rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach is relevant for the clinical decision-making, as it may obviate the need for further diagnostic evaluation of the heart structure and muscle function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CMR can reliably detect a variety of heart muscle diseases without requiring bioptic confirmation of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, CMR provides anatomo-functional information that possesses incremental and independent prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represents a new paradigm shift as it moves the attention from the coronary arteries to the heart muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMR is useful in establishing the correct diagnosis of several clinical conditions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, thus guiding therapeutic strategies and influencing patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
