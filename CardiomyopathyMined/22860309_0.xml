<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 15-year-old man developed cardiopulmonary dysfunction 4 days after flu-like symptom, and was transfered to our hospital and diagnosed as a fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (FM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraaortic ballon pumping (IABP) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) were immediately initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cardiac function did not recover until 7 days after admission to the ICU, and bilateral ventricular assist devices (BiVAD) were introduced with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular assist device (RVAD) with ECMO was established by right atrial blood withdrawal and pulmonary arterial blood supply using centrifugal pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After operation of BiVAD, to main LVAD flow, frequent blood-and-fluids volume loading and increase in RVAD flow were necessary due to postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and massive foamy sputum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, even after hemostasis had been established, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> continued and it was difficult to maintain LVAD flow because of endless transudation from the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eventually, he developed MOF and passed away 9 days after the admission to ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As in cases of end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, outflow of RVAD into the left atrium instead of the pulmonary artery was demonstrated effective in avoiding trans-pulmonary leakage, and outflow of RVAD into the left atrium may be beneficial to patients with FM who need BiVAD but suffered severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
