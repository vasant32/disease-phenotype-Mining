<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to compare the SSFP with the conventional FSE and STIR (FSE/STIR) method for the detection of LV intramyocardial fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four consecutive patients with OMI (&gt;1,000 days) and 69 patients with a diagnosis of ARVC underwent magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LV fat was detected in 29 patients (53.7%) in SSFP images and in 28 patients (51.9%) in FSE/STIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At Bland- Altman plot a close agreement was found between the extent of fat measured in SSFP images and in FSE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a slight systematic overestimation, was found for the fat quantification in the SSFP images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ARVC group, both FSE/STIR and SSFP images evidenced fat infiltration in LV myocardium in 11 patients (15.9%) without any mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SSFP had 100% sensitivity and 98.8% of specificity to detect LV intramyocardial fat in ARVC and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSFP sequence with TR/TE = 2 is capable in identifying and quantifying the presence of fat tissue within the LV myocardium in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and ARVC </plain></SENT>
