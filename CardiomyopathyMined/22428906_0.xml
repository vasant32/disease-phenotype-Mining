<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 2/3 affected boys inherit their mutation from their carrier mother whereupon other female relatives are at-risk of carrying the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female carriers are also at-risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and regular cardiac screening is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical genetics services offer genetic counselling and carrier tests for consenting relatives of DMD patients known as 'cascade screening' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed data from two genetics centres, West of Scotland and South East Thames where the latter centre operated a computer-held DMD register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the period, 1971-2008, in 195 West of Scotland families, a total of 843 potential carriers: 16% of 1(st) degree relatives and 48% of 2(nd) degree and more distant relatives were not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In South East Thames, 1223 potential carriers in 349 families: 49% of 1(st) degree and 65% of 2(nd) degree and more distant relatives were not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are similar to BMD/DMD carrier screening results recently reported from the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrospective results from three countries indicate that despite efforts to offer extended cascade screening, significant numbers of potential carriers of DMD remain unaware of their reproductive and health risks </plain></SENT>
