<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to delineate the clinical features and course of children with HCM and RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An institutional review of 119 patients identified between 1985 and 2010 with the diagnosis of HCM was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of RP was based on &gt;1 echocardiogram along with at least one of the following: left atrial enlargement without evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricle dilation</z:mp>, E/E' ratio ≥ 10, and E/A ratio ≥ 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes analysis was performed using Cox or Poisson regression when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RP was present in 50 (42%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients without RP, 10-year freedom-from-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (aSCD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or heart transplant (HT), were 93.6 and 98.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with RP, 10-year freedom-from-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or aSCD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or HT, were 59.0 and 71.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RP conferred a 3.5-fold increase in incidence rate of hospitalization (P = 0.01), a 3.8-fold increase in hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or aSCD (P = 0.02), and a 5.7-fold increase in hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or HT (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessment for RP is of paramount importance in children with HCM because those without RP have a good prognosis, and those with RP account for the majority of poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
