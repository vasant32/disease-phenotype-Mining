<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human Jup gene cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) a heart muscle disease that often leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of the murine Jup gene (also known as plakoglobin) results in <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to generate a conditional knockout allele, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> cassette was introduced into the murine plakoglobin (PG) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This allele (PG F(N) ) functions as a hypomorph when combined with a null allele (PG Δ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About half of the PG F(N) /Δ animals were smaller than their littermates and died before weaning age, whereas the remaining PG F(N) /Δ animals survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the reduced levels of PG in the heart, there were no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or cardiac dysfunction as determined by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the PG homolog, β-catenin (CTNNB1), was increased in the PG F(N) /Δ hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to its structural role as part of the N-cadherin/catenin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> complex, β-catenin is a downstream effector of Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no change in β-catenin/TCF reporter activity was observed in PG F(N) /Δ embryos suggesting that excess β-catenin was not likely causing increased transcription of Wnt/β-catenin target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest novel function(s) for PG beyond the heart and define a critical threshold of PG expression that is necessary for postnatal survival. © 2012 Wiley-Liss, Inc </plain></SENT>
