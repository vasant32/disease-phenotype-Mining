<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The R21C substitution in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the only identified mutation within its unique N-terminal extension that is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly, this mutation is located in the consensus sequence for Î²-adrenergic-activated protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which this mutation leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we generated cTnI knock-in mouse models carrying an R21C mutation to evaluate the resultant functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measuring the in vivo levels of incorporated mutant and WT cTnI, and their basal phosphorylation levels by top-down mass spectrometry demonstrated: 1) a dominant-negative effect such that, the R21C+/- hearts incorporated 24.9% of the mutant cTnI within the myofilament; and 2) the R21C mutation abolished the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser(23)/Ser(24) in the mutant cTnI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult heterozygous (R21C+/-) and homozygous (R21C+/+) mutant mice activated the fetal gene program and developed a remarkable degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation of cardiac skinned fibers isolated from WT and heterozygous mice revealed that the WT cTnI was completely phosphorylated at Ser(23)/Ser(24) unless the mice were pre-treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> treatment (-PKA), the pCa-tension relationships of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three mice (i.e. WT, R21C+/-, and R21C+/+) were essentially the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, after treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and PKA, the R21C cTnI mutation reduced (R21C+/-) or abolished (R21C+/+) the well known decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension that accompanies Ser(23)/Ser(24) cTnI phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the combined effects of the R21C mutation appear to contribute toward the development of HCM and suggest that another physiological role for the phosphorylation of Ser(23)/Ser(24) in cTnI is to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
