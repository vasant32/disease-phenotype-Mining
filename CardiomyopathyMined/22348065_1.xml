<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multifunctional kinase linking the extracellular matrix to intracellular signaling pathways, whose activation in the heart gives rise to a number of functional consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the therapeutic and survival benefit of cardiac ILK overexpression in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> model was generated in rats by intraperitoneal administration of six equal doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> over a 2 week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five weeks after the first injection, echocardiographic analysis demonstrated impaired cardiac function and, at that point, recombinant adenoviral vector harboring ILK cDNA or vehicle was injected into the myocardium, and the rats re-studied 4 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with vehicle injection, ILK treatment ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration and cardiomyocyte degeneration, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp> and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ILK treatment was also associated with a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and an increase in proliferation of cardiomyocytes, as well as decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and autophagic vacuole accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mortality was lower in rats following ILK treatment than in those following vehicle injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we also found that ILK overexpression protected against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, giving rise to an increase in their proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate for the first time that ILK gene therapy improves cardiac function and survival in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and this may be mediated through suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, prevention of ventricular remodeling, inhibition of cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and autophagy, and stimulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
