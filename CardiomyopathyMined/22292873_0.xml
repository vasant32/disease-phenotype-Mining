<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EPCs are involved in the process of adult vasculogenesis and repair of dysfunctional endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> has been documented in the peripheral and coronary arteries of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients, and has proved to be an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has led researchers to analyze the association of EPCs and disease severity in HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review studies analyzing the prognostic role of EPCs in patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through a systematic search, we identified 14 relevant studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one study analyzed mortality as an outcome; the others evaluated the association between EPC levels and patients' characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, results were inconsistent and suggested that levels of EPCs may vary according to factors such as disease severity, underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and medical therapy </plain></SENT>
