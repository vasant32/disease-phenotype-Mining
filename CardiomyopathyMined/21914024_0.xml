<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether there is a gender difference in the benefit derived from CRT has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 728 consecutive CRT recipients at our institution who met guidelines for placement of a CRT device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were collected at baseline and after CRT; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using a national <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and location database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects and outcome of CRT were compared between women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 728 patients, 166 were female (22.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients were younger than male patients (66.0 ± 11.9 years vs 69.4 ± 10.9 years; P &lt; 0.001) and more often had nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (68% vs 36%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both female and male patients had significantly improved clinical and echocardiographic parameters after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of improvement was similar in women and men, except that improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was greater in women than in men (-0.79 ± 0.78 vs -0.56 ± 0.85; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although women were at lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than men after CRT (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.75; P &lt; 0.001, unadjusted), multivariate analysis indicated gender was not, but age at CRT placement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> cause, NYHA class, and lead location were independent predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Female CRT recipients seem to achieve greater survival benefit than male recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this benefit is majorly driven by nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and other clinical factors </plain></SENT>
