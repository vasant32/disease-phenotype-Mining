<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beat-to-beat intervals (BBI) of 30-min ECGs recorded from 91 DCM patients and 21 healthy subjects were analyzed applying the lagged segmented Poincaré plot analysis (LSPPA) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LSPPA includes the Poincaré plot reconstruction with lags of 1-100, rotating the cloud of points, its normalized segmentation adapted to their standard deviations, and finally, a frequency-dependent clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lags were combined into eight different clusters representing specific frequency bands within 0.012-1.153 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences between low- and high-risk <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> could be found within the clusters II-VIII (e.g., cluster IV: 0.033-0.038 Hz; p = 0.0002; sensitivity = 85.7 %; specificity = 71.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate statistics led to a sensitivity of 92.9 %, specificity of 85.7 % and an area under the curve of 92.1 % discriminating these patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We introduced the LSPPA method to investigate time correlations in BBI time series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that LSPPA contributes considerably to risk stratification in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and yields the highest discriminant power in the low and very low-frequency bands </plain></SENT>
