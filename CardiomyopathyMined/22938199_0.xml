<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Significance: Aerobic organisms must exist between the dueling biological metabolic processes for energy and respiration and the obligatory generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) whose deleterious consequences can reduce survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wide fluctuations in harmful ROS generation are circumvented by endogenous countermeasures (i.e., enzymatic and non-enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> systems) whose capacity decline with aging and are enhanced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent Advances: Substantial efforts on the cellular and molecular underpinnings of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> has been complemented recently by the discovery that reductive stress similarly predisposes to inheritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, firmly establishing that the biological extremes of the redox spectrum play essential roles in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Critical Issues: Because <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> by nutritional or pharmacological supplement to prevent or mitigate <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> have been largely disappointing, we hypothesize that lack of efficacy of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> might be related to adverse outcomes in responders at the reductive end of the redox spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As emerging concepts such as reductive, as opposed, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are further explored, there is an urgent and critical gap for 'biochemical' phenotyping in order to guide the 'targeted' clinical applications of therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future Directions: New approaches are vitally needed for characterizing redox states with the long-term goal to noninvasively assess distinct clinical states (e.g., presymptomatic, end-stage) with the diagnostic accuracy to guide personalized medicine. â€ƒ </plain></SENT>
