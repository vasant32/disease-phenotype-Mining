<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Biventricular pacing has demonstrated improvement in cardiac functions in treating congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent trials have proven the clinical and functional benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and intraventricular cardiac delays, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biventricular pacing improves the exercise tolerance, quality of life, systolic heart function, reduces hospitalization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slows progression</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old lady, a known case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, was on biventricular pacing since 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She presented in emergency with sudden deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> to NYHA class III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When investigated, the coronary sinus lead was found displaced; thus, left ventricle (LV) was not getting paced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multiple failures to reposition the coronary sinus lead, it was decided to surgically place the epicardial lead for LV pacing under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lateral thoracotomy was done and LV pacing lead was placed at different sites with simultaneous monitoring of cardiac output (CO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV) by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline CO and SV were 1.9 l/min and 19.48 ml respectively and increased at different sites of pacing at LV, the best CO and SV were 4.2 l/min and 42.39 ml respectively on lateral surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative TEE can calculate beat to beat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and thus CO and helps to choose optimal site for placement of epicardial pacing lead </plain></SENT>
