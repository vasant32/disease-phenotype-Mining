<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, also called <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, is a special form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that is precipitated by a stress situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can occur after a surgical procedure that results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein we have presented 2 cases of reversible stress-induced cardiac dysfunction early in the period after liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, cardiac evaluation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with both patients classified as low risk for cardiovascular events during the proposed procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> after graft reperfusion with return of spontaneous circulation after resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their early periods after transplantation were characterized by cardiogenic shock secondary to important ventricular dysfunction requiring vasoactive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent investigations excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was established based on the clinical features and ancillary tests, particularly echocardiography showing apical ballooning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases, ventricular function recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, an underestimated cause of heart complications, should be considered as a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in liver transplant patients </plain></SENT>
