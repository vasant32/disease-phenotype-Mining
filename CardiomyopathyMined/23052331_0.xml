<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recognizing adverse events (AE) is important for safety evaluation, harm prevention and may aid in the design of future trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence of periprocedural AE in CTh trials in MI and iCMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database from January 1990 to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controlled clinical trials that compared CTh with standard treatment in the setting of MI and/or iCMP were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AE related to CTh were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,472 patients from 35 trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 26 trials including 1,796 patients that used CTh in MI and 9 trials including 676 patients that used CTh in iCMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring protocols were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and follow-up was short in most of the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MI trials, the incidence of periprocedural adverse events (AE) related to intracoronary cell transplantation was 7.5 % (95 % CI 6.04-8.96 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AE related to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCS-F) used for cell mobilization for peripheral apheresis was 16 % (95 % CI 9.44-22.56 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During intracoronary transplantation in iCMP, the incidence of periprocedural AE incidence was 2.6 % (95 % CI 0.53-4.67 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no AE reported during transepicardial transplantation and AE were rare during transendocardial transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of periprocedural AE in CTh trials in MI occurred during intracoronary transplantation and GCS-F administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In iCMP, periprocedural AE were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Avoiding intracoronary route for CTh implantation may decrease the burden of periprocedural AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Standardization of AE definition in CTh trials is needed </plain></SENT>
