<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The classic Morrow technique for hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HOCM) in patients with simultaneous obstruction of left ventricular (LV) midcavity and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) combined with extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, is not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new technique for HOCM surgical correction in patients with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The excision of the asymmetrical hypertrophied area of the interventricular septum (IVS) causing simultaneous midventricular and RVOT obstruction was performed from the conal part of the right ventricle (RV) in the middle part of the right side of the IVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conceptually, this approach offers a number of advantages: it affords the excision of the asymmetrically hypertrophied area of the ventricular septum without penetration into the left ventricular cavity, it avoids mechanical damage to the heart conduction system and aortic valve and, for the surgeon, it improves the visual inspection of the area to be resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with the midventricular obstruction of the LV associated with RVOT obstruction [mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3.0] underwent this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 24.8 ± 11.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients were free of symptoms (NYHA class I) and one was in NYHA class 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean value of the echocardiographic intraventricular gradients in the LV decreased from 86.3 ± 9.9 to 10.3 ± 5.3 mmHg, the mean value of the gradients in the RVOT decreased to 44.9 ± 9.6 versus 4.1 ± 1.2 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm without the block of the bundle of the right branch was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients needed the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This technique for the surgical correction of HOCM provides the effective simultaneous elimination of LV midventricular and RVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A major advantage is that injuries, in particular to the conduction system, are easily avoided </plain></SENT>
