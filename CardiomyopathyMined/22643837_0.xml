<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> are caused by point mutations in sarcomeric gene products, including α-cardiac muscle actin (ACTC1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the biochemical and cell biological properties of the α-cardiac actin mutations Y166C and M305L identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Untagged <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) cardiac actin, and the Y166C and M305L mutants were expressed by the baculovirus/Sf9-cell system and affinity purified by immobilized gelsolin G4-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their correct folding was verified by a number of assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutant actins also displayed a disturbed intrinsic ATPase activity and an altered polymerization behavior in the presence of tropomyosin, gelsolin, and Arp2/3 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both mutants stimulated the cardiac β-myosin ATPase to only 50 % of WT cardiac F-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">Copolymers</z:chebi> of WT and increasing amounts of the mutant actins led to a reduced stimulation of the myosin ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfection of established cell lines revealed incorporation of EGFP- and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged WT and both mutant actins into cytoplasmic stress fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral vectors of HA-tagged WT and Y166C actin were successfully used to infect adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressed HA-tagged actins were incorporated into the minus-ends of NRC thin filaments, demonstrating the ability to form hybrid thin filaments with endogenous actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In NRCs, the Y166C mutant led after 72 h to a shortening of the sarcomere length when compared to NRCs infected with WT actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus our data demonstrate that a mutant actin can be integrated into cardiomyocyte thin filaments and by its reduced mode of myosin interaction might be the basis for the initiation of HCM </plain></SENT>
