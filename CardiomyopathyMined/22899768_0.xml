<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Previous studies have reported worse outcomes in children with nondilated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>) listed for heart transplant compared with children with dilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare wait-list and posttransplant outcomes in these groups in the current era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children &lt;18 years of age with a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> listed for heart transplant in the United States between July 2004 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on the wait-list (or becoming too sick to transplant) and posttransplant graft loss (median follow-up 2 years) were assessed using Cox models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 1436 children analyzed, 1197 (83%) had dilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> and 239 (17%) had nondilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> (167 restrictive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>, 72 hypertrophic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analysis, children with nondilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> were at higher risk of wait-list mortality only if they were on a ventilator support at <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> (hazard ratio, 2.3; CI, 1.2-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk was similar among children not on a ventilator support (hazard ratio, 0.6; CI, 0.3-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant 30-day and 1-year survival was 98% and 94%, respectively, in children with dilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> versus 95% and 89%, respectively, in children with nondilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> (P=0.17, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analysis, the risk of posttransplant graft loss was higher in nondilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> (hazard ratio, 1.8; CI, 1.2-2.7) versus dilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- The increased risk of wait-list mortality in children with nondilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> is limited to those on ventilator support at <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the risk of graft loss is modestly higher in children with nondilated forms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>, their short-term transplant outcomes are good </plain></SENT>
