<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alcohol septal ablation has emerged as a therapy for patients with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are limited data on the predictors of success with the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined patient characteristics and cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> as well as procedural data on 166 HCM patients (mean age, 63 years; 43% men), who underwent ablation at Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were contacted to determine vital status and symptoms to assess the primary endpoint of survival free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe symptoms (New York Heart Association, class III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The strongest patient characteristics that predicted clinical success were older age, less severe left ventricular outflow tract gradient, lesser ventricular septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and a smaller left anterior descending (LAD) diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve geometry or ventricular septal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> did not predict outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥3 characteristics (age ≥65 years, gradient &lt;100 mmHg, septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> ≤18 mm, LAD diameter &lt;4.0 mm) had superior 4-year survival free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe symptoms (90.4%) in comparison to those with two characteristics (81.6%) and ≤1 characteristic (57.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case volume with &gt;50 patients was an independent predictor of survival free of severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of alcohol injected, number of arteries injected, or size of septal perforator artery were not predictive of clinical success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Greater case volume and selection for key patient and anatomic characteristics are associated with superior outcomes with alcohol septal ablation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
