<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCM can result from mutations in the gene encoding cardiac α-tropomyosin (TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand how the HCM-causing Asp175Asn and Glu180Gly mutations in α-tropomyosin affect on actin-myosin interaction during the ATPase cycle, we labeled the SH1 helix of myosin subfragment-1 and the actin subdomain-1 with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi> N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29922">sulfo</z:chebi>-1-naphtylo)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30347">ethylenediamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These proteins were incorporated into ghost muscle fibers and their conformational states were monitored during the ATPase cycle by measuring polarized fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the first time, the effect of these α-tropomyosins on the mobility and rotation of subdomain-1 of actin and the SH1 helix of myosin subfragment-1 during the ATP hydrolysis cycle have been demonstrated directly by polarized fluorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> α-tropomyosin increases the amplitude of the SH1 helix and subdomain-1 movements during the ATPase cycle, indicating the enhancement of the efficiency of the work of cross-bridges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both mutant TMs increase the proportion of the strong-binding sub-states, with the effect of the Glu180Gly mutation being greater than that of Asp175Asn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the alteration in the concerted conformational changes of actomyosin is likely to provide the structural basis for the altered cardiac muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
