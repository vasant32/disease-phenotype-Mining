<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in MYH7 encoding the beta myosin heavy chain protein have been implicated in cardiac and, less frequently, skeletal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscle disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report four patients from two families with a histopathological diagnosis of MmD, presenting in childhood with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, more proximal in Family 1 and more distal in Family 2, and variable degrees of cardiorespiratory impairment evolving later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also a strong family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the first family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies obtained in early childhood showed multiple minicores as the most prominent feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the MYH7 gene revealed heterozygous missense mutations, c.4399C&gt;G; p.Leu1467Val (exon 32) in Family 1 and c.4763G&gt;C; p.Arg1588Pro (exon 34) in Family 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest MYH7 mutations as another cause of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with multiple cores, in particular if associated with dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
