<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction The prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is incompletely studied in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, right ventricular function may signal worse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated recently published right ventricular function echocardiographic indices in identifying dysfunction in children with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the impact of right ventricular dysfunction on long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective database review of right ventricular function indices in 30 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was compared with 60 age- and sex-matched controls from January, 2001 until December, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular function was assessed by Doppler tissue peak systolic S', early and late diastolic E' and A' waves and isovolumic acceleration at the tricuspid valve annulus; pulsed wave Doppler tricuspid valve inflow E and A waves; right ventricular myocardial performance index; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion; right ventricular fractional area change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Right ventricular systolic and diastolic function in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was significantly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measured indices except for isovolumic acceleration and fractional area change were significantly reduced, with a p-value less than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no right ventricular index predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor outcome were significantly more likely to need inotropic support (p-value equal to 0.018), be placed on a ventricular assist device (p equal to 0.005), and have a worse left ventricular ejection fraction z-score (p-value equal to 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Right ventricular dysfunction is under-recognised in children presenting with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The need for clinical circulatory support and left ventricular ejection fraction z-score less than minus 8 were primary determinants of outcome, independent of the degree of derangement in right ventricular function </plain></SENT>
