<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi>, one of the original <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, remains among the most effective anticancer drugs ever developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> is, however, greatly limited by its serious adverse cardiac effects that may ultimately lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tanshinone IIA is the main effective component of Salvia miltiorrhiza known as 'Danshen' in traditional Chinese medicine for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was set to evaluate the protective effect of tanshinone IIA on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and to explore its intracellular mechanism(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with the vehicle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (1 μM), tanshinone IIA (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 μM), or tanshinone IIA plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that tanshinone IIA (1 and 3 μM) inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced reactive oxygen species generation, reduced the quantity of cleaved caspase-3 and cytosol <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and increased BcL-x(L) expression, resulting in protecting cardiomyocytes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Akt phosphorylation was enhanced by tanshinone IIA treatment in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> (100 nM), LY294002 (10 nM), and siRNA transfection for Akt significantly reduced tanshinone IIA-induced protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that tanshinone IIA protects cardiomyocytes from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in part through Akt-signaling pathways, which may potentially protect the heart from the severe toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
