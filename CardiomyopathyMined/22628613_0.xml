<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of transgenic expression of diacylglycerol acyl transferase 1 (DGAT1) in cardiomyocytes is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored whether mice expressing DGAT1 via the myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter develop heart dysfunction with aging or after crossing with mice over expressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MHC-DGAT1 transgenic mice had increased heart <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> but no evidence of heart dysfunction, even up to age 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MHC-DGAT1 transgene improved heart dysfunction and survival of MHC-PPARγ-expressing transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both diacylglycerol and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> levels in the heart were reduced by this cross, as were the levels of several <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were fewer large <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets in MHC-DGAT1×MHC-PPARγ mice compared with MHC-PPARγ, but total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overexpression of DGAT1 is not toxic to the heart but reduces levels of toxic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and improves lipotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the beneficial effects of DGAT1 illustrate the interrelationship of several <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolic pathways and the difficulty of assigning benefit to an isolated change in one potentially toxic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> species </plain></SENT>
