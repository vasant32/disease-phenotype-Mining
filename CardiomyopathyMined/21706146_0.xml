<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography is an alternative modality, particularly when MRI cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that RV volume and ejection fraction computed by angiography would correlate with these quantities as computed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RV volumes and ejection fraction were computed for subjects enrolled in the North American ARVC/D Registry, with both RV angiography and MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed in the 30° right anterior oblique (RAO) and 60° left anterior oblique (LAO) views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic volumes were computed by RAO view and two-view (RAO and LAO) formulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>17 subjects were analyzed (11 men and 6 women), with 15 subjects classified as affected, and two as unaffected by modified Task Force criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient of MRI to the two-view angiographic analysis was 0.72 (P = 0.003) for end-diastolic volume and 0.68 (P = 0.005) for ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographically derived volumes were larger than MRI derived volume (P = 0.009) and with the slope in a linear relationship equal to 0.8 for end diastolic volume, and 0.9 for RV ejection fraction (P &lt; 0.001), computed by the two view formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>End-diastolic volumes and ejection fractions of the RV obtained by dual view angiography correlate with these quantities by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RV end-diastolic volumes are larger by RV angiography in comparison with MRI </plain></SENT>
