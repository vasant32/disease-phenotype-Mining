<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify differences in response to cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) among DM patients with ischemic or nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to assess clinical response to CRT-D (defined as CRT-D vs. defibrillator-only reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and echocardiographic response (defined as percent reduction in left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volume [LVEDV and LVESV, respectively] at 12 month of follow-up compared with baseline values) among 552 diabetic patients with ischemic (n = 367) or nonischemic (n = 185) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> enrolled in MADIT-CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical benefit of CRT-D was more pronounced among nonischemic patients (HR = 0.30 [P &lt; 0.001] than among ischemic patients (HR = 0.59 [P = 0.004]; P for interaction = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonischemic patients also experienced significantly greater reductions in LVESV and LVEDV at 12 months with CRT-D compared with ischemic patients (P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed that the most pronounced reduction in HF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with CRT-D therapy occurred in nonischemic patients who were women (83% risk-reduction [P &lt; 0.001]), had a lower BMI (&lt;30/kg/m(2) : 79% risk-reduction [P &lt; 0.001]), or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> at enrollment (82% risk-reduction [P &lt; 0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that treatment with CRT-D in at-risk cardiac patients with DM is associated with substantial reductions in the risk of HF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and improvement in cardiac remodeling in those with ischemic and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with a more pronounced benefit in patients with nonischemic disease </plain></SENT>
