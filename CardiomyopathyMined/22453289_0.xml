<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the heart, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enhances fatty acid metabolism, suppresses <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation, and modifies intracellular signaling, leading to impairments in multiple steps of excitation-contraction coupling, inefficient energy production, and increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> microvessels and remodeling of the extracellular matrix are also involved in contractile dysfunction of diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of sensitive echocardiographic techniques (tissue Doppler imaging and strain rate imaging) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy enables detection of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at an early stage, and a combination of the modalities allows differentiation of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circumstantial evidence to date indicates that diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a common but frequently unrecognized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in asymptomatic diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a strategy for prevention or treatment of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to improve its prognosis has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we review both basic and clinical studies on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and summarize problems remaining to be solved for improving management of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
