<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared serum levels of ferritin at diagnosis and other conditions with the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> using data from 2 cohorts of probands with <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> who were homozygous for HFE C282Y (an Alabama cohort, n = 294, 63.9% men and an Ontario cohort, n = 128, 68.8% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>-associated causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo>) caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by myocardial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">siderosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> probands received phlebotomy and other appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean survival times after diagnosis were 13.2 ± 7.3 y and 12.5 ± 8.3 y in Alabama and Ontario probands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis were observed in 30.1% and 47.7% of Alabama and Ontario probands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In logistic regressions of serum ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L, there were significant positive associations with male sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> in Alabama probands and with age, male sex, increased levels of alanine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> in Ontario probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of probands with serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis, 17.9% of those from Alabama and 14.8% of those from Ontario died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among probands with serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L, the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 5.4 for the Alabama group (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-13.1; P = .0002) and 4.9 for the Ontario group (95% CI, 1.1-22.0; P = .0359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> probands homozygous for HFE C282Y, serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis were positively associated with male sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
