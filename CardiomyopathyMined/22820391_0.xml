<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a male patient affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) with no point mutations in the eight sarcomeric genes most commonly involved in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) we have identified a multi-exons C-terminus deletion in the cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement has been confirmed by long PCR and breakpoints have been defined by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3.5kb terminal deletion is mediated by Alu-repeat elements and is predicted to result in haploinsufficiency of MYBPC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To exclude the presence of other rare pathogenic variants in additional HCM genes, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 88 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-associated genes but we did not identify any further mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the MYBPC3 multi-exons deletion was detectable by NGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding broadens the range of mutational spectrum observed in HCM, contributing to understanding the genetic basis of the most common inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data suggest that NGS may represent a new tool to achieve a deeper insight into molecular basis of complex diseases, allowing to detect in a single experiment both point mutations and gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
