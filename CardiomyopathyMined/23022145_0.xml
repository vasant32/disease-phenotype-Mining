<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these are many proteins implicated in human diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's Diseases</z:e>, as well as spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> 1, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two more recent additions to the list of human disease-associated proteins that are sumoylated are amyloid precursor protein and lamin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APP sumoylation modulates A-beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels, suggesting a potential role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e>, and decreased lamin A sumoylation due to mutations near its SUMO site has been implicated in causing some forms of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of involvement of sumoylation in human diseases has sparked significant interest in finding pharmacologic and other mechanisms for altering the sumoylation of proteins in the cell, with the goal of developing new therapeutic interventions for combating these diseases </plain></SENT>
