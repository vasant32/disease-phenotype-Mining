<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic profiling, we sought to decipher the relationships between the metabolism and cellular signaling pathways in human heart tissues collected from patients with ISCM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e>, and those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and dilation.Methods and ResultsThe comparative analysis suggested a decrease in glycolysis, Krebs cycle and malate-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> shuttle activities in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and an increase in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> body oxidation only in ISCM </plain></SENT>
