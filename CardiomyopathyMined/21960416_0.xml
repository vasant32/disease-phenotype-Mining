<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is a novel treatment option for patients with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, proved to reduce local and whole-body sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) (non-obstructive hypertrophic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, NYHA III) suffering from therapy resistant electrical storm underwent therapeutic renal denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both patients, RDN was conducted with agreement of the local ethics committee and after obtaining informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> had recurrent monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> despite extensive antiarrhythmic therapy, following repeated endocardial and epicardial electrophysiological ablation attempts to destroy an arrhythmogenic intramural focus in the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient, with dilated nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, suffered from recurrent episodes of polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient declined catheter ablation of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients, RDN was performed without procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following RDN, ventricular tachyarrhythmias were significantly reduced in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and clinical status remained stable during the procedure and follow-up in these patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that RDN is feasible even in cardiac unstable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to study the effects of RD in patients with electrical storm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
