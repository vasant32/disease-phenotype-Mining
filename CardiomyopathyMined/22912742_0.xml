<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that ErbB2 signaling has a critical role in cardiomyocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, based mainly on findings that blocking ErbB2 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy is toxic to cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, consequences of high levels of ErbB2 activity in the heart have not been previously explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated consequences of cardiac-restricted over-expression of ErbB2 in two novel lines of transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both lines develop striking concentric <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or decreased life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ErbB2 transgenic mice display electrocardiographic characteristics similar to those found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with susceptibility to adrenergic-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hypertrophic hearts, which are 2-3 times larger than those of control littermates, express increased atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and Î²-myosin heavy chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, consistent with a hypertrophic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes in these hearts are significantly larger than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> cardiomyocytes, with enlarged nuclei and distinctive myocardial disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the over-expression of ErbB2 induces a concurrent up-regulation of multiple proteins associated with this signaling pathway, including EGFR, ErbB3, ErbB4, PI3K subunits p110 and p85, bcl-2 and multiple protective heat shock proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ErbB2 up-regulation leads to an anti-apoptotic shift in the ratio of bcl-xS/xL in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, ErbB2 over-expression results in increased activation of the translation machinery involving S6, 4E-BP1 and eIF4E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dependence of this hypertrophic phenotype on ErbB family signaling is confirmed by reduction in heart mass and cardiomyocyte size, and inactivation of pro-hypertrophic signaling in transgenic animals treated with the ErbB1/2 inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies are the first to demonstrate that increased ErbB2 over-expression in the heart can activate protective signaling pathways and induce a phenotype consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our work suggests that in the situation where ErbB2 signaling contributes to <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, inhibition of this pathway may reverse this process </plain></SENT>
