<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the finding of calcified vibrissae in Abcc6(-/-) mice, which facilitates the study of dystrophic calcification by histological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether mice prone to dystrophic cardiac calcification (C3H/HeOuJ and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J strains) presented similar vibrissae changes and to evaluate the value of microcomputed tomography to quantify the extent of mystacial vibrissae calcifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These calcifications were absent in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J and C57BL/6J control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both Abcc6(-/-) and C3H/HeOuJ mice, calcifications progressed in a caudal-rostral direction with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the calcification process was delayed in C3H/HeOuJ mice, indicating an incomplete expression of the calcification phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that the calcification process in the cephalic region was not limited to mystacial vibrissae but was also present in other periorbital sensorial vibrissae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vibrissae calcification was circular and encompassed the medial region of the vibrissae capsule, adjacent to the ring and cavernous sinuses (the areas adjacent to blood and lymphatic vessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings confirm that Abcc6 acts as an inhibitor of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mineralization and that microcomputed tomography is a valuable noninvasive tool for the assessment of the calcification phenotype in Abcc6-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
