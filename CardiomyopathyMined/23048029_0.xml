<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause a diverse spectrum of diseases, the most common of which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> often with skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lamin A and C are fundamental components of the nuclear lamina, a dynamic meshwork of intermediate filaments lining the nuclear envelope inner membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevailing evidence suggests the nuclear envelope functions as a signaling node and that abnormality in the nuclear lamina lead to dysregulated signaling pathways that underlie disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that activated ERK1/2 in hearts of a mouse model of LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LmnaH222P/H222P mice) contributes to disease but the complete molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we uncover a pathogenic role of dual specificity phosphatase 4 (Dusp4), which is transcriptionally induced by ERK1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dusp4 is highly expressed in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice and transgenic mice with cardiac-selective overexpression of Dusp4 display heart dysfunction similar to LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both primary tissue and cell culture models, overexpression of Dusp4 positively regulates AKT-mTOR signaling resulting in impaired autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings identify a pathogenic role of Dusp4 in LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
