<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous C-to-T transition, c.1255C&gt;T, p.Pro419Ser in the desmin gene on chromosome 2q35, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies had demonstrated linkage to chromosome 10q22.3, but no causative mutation had been found in that region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sanger sequencing of DNA from 17 family members confirmed the heterozygous c.1255C&gt;T desmin mutation in seven out of ten family members that had been classified as affected in the previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our new results demonstrate the usefulness of next-generation sequencing, and the diagnostic difficulties with some forms of dominantly inherited muscle diseases as they can display a wide clinical and morphological variability even within a given family </plain></SENT>
