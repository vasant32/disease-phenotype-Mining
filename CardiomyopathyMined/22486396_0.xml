<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if three-dimensional (3D) speckle tracking-derived functional parameters enabled differentiation of CA and HCM by a disease-specific pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with CA and 12 patients with HCM were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CA and HCM were diagnosed by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography with wall motion analysis was performed for strain (radial [RS(%)], longitudinal [LS (-%)], and circumferential [CS (-%)]), rotation (ROT [degree]), and twist (TWT [degree]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intergroup comparison included normalized values from 49 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Averaged RS, LS, CS, ROT, and TWT were investigated at basal, midventricular, and apical levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With some exceptions, 3D speckle tracking function parameters were mostly lower in the HCM and minimal in the CA group as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing CA and HCM, basal RS was significantly reduced in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (7.5 ± 19.7 vs. 22.3 ± 22.7; P &lt; 0.0001), furthermore the "physiological" gradient of basoapically decreasing RS, which was reduced, but still preserved in HCM, showed a clear "inverse pattern" in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, comprising a gradual increase from base to apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis of 3D speckle tracking function and CMR late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) revealed high inverse correlation of RS and LGE in CA (r =-0.82) and only mild correlation in HCM, followed by CS as second best parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increasing/decreasing basoapical RS gradient yielded a sensitivity of 83% versus the CMR-derived diagnosis "CA" and "HCM." CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography demonstrated significant differences in CA and HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The basoapical RS gradient displayed oppositional characteristics in CA and HCM, suggesting a "function-pattern-based" differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and HCM </plain></SENT>
