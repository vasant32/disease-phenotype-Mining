<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effects of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> agent tempol on periapical lesions in rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in comparison with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) naïve rats orally treated with saline solution (10 mL/kg, during 21 days after periapical lesion induction); (2) naïve rats treated with tempol (30 and 50 mg/kg, during 21 days after periapical lesion induction) by oral pathway; (3) rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> treated with saline solution by oral route (10 mL/kg, from day 3 to day 10 after initiating treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>); and (4) rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> orally treated with tempol (30 and 50 mg/kg, from day 3 to day 10 after initiating treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Periapical lesions were induced on the first right mandibular molar tooth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 21 days of apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> induction, the animals were killed, and the mandibles were collected for radiographic and histologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The oral administration of tempol (50 mg/kg) was able to significantly prevent the establishment of periapical lesions in either control animals or rats submitted to the model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, according to radiographic and histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the protective effects of tempol were virtually greater in control animals in comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-treated rats, as indicated by histologic inflammatory assessment, which might be related to the increased production of free radicals under <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence on the beneficial systemic effects of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> tempol on apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> in both control animals and rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-elicited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
