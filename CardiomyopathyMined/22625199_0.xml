<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to report on the pathology of transcatheter aortic valves explanted at early and late time points after transcatheter aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Information on pathological findings following transcatheter aortic valve implantation is scarce, particularly late after transcatheter aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 20 patients (13 men, median age 80 years [interquartile range: 72 to 84] years) with previous transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a valve explanted at autopsy (n = 17) or surgery (n = 3) up to 30 months after implantation (10 transapical and 10 transfemoral procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Structural valve degeneration was not seen, although fibrous tissue ingrowth was observed at later time points with minimal effects on cusp mobility in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minor alterations in valve configuration or placement were observed in up to 50% of cases, but they were not accompanied by substantial changes in valve function or reliably associated with chest compressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular or myocardial injury was common, especially within 30 days of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (about 69%), with the latter associated with left coronary ostial occlusion by calcified native aortic valve tissue in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild to severe myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was present in nearly 33% of cases and likely played a role in the poor outcome of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo>, migration of the valve, and embolization during the procedure led to surgical valve removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Structural degeneration was not seen and minor alterations of valve configuration or placement did not affect valve function and were not reliably caused by chest compressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular or myocardial injury is very common early after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> represents a relatively frequent potentially significant comorbid condition </plain></SENT>
