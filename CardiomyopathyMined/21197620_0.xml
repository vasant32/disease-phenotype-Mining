<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have here demonstrated that TRAIL (administrated as either recombinant soluble TRAIL or as AAV-TRAIL expression <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector) reduced the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the ApoE(-/-) diabetic mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest, for the first time, that therapeutically administration of TRAIL might have a cardioprotective effect </plain></SENT>
