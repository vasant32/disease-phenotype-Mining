<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that patients with reverse-remodeled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), whose ejection fractions (EFs) were normalized after optimal pharmacologic therapy, had subclinical myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with reverse-remodeled <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, defined as having an initial EF ≤ 35%, which then recovered to ≥50% after optimal pharmacologic therapy, and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with preserved EFs were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Averaged peak systolic and early diastolic radial, circumferential, and longitudinal speckle-tracking strain rates were assessed from an 18-segment left ventricular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, averaged peak systolic radial, circumferential, and longitudinal speckle-tracking strain was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak systolic and early diastolic longitudinal strain rates, peak systolic and early diastolic circumferential strain rates, and peak circumferential and longitudinal strain in patients with reverse-remodeled <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were significantly lower than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but peak systolic and early diastolic radial strain rates and peak radial strain in patients with reverse-remodeled <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were similar to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isometric handgrip stress testing showed a significant decrease in EF from 56 ± 5% to 51 ± 5% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, the increase of afterload resulting from isometric handgrip stress testing was associated with a decrease in peak systolic circumferential and longitudinal strain rates and peak circumferential strain in patients with reverse-remodeled <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The circumferential and longitudinal myocardial function of patients with reverse-remodeled <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> is lower compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with preserved EFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in afterload was associated with the decrease in circumferential and longitudinal myocardial systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in treated patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with reverse remodeling, left ventricular mechanics may not be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, even when EFs are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
