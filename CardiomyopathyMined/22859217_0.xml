<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the effects of bone marrow‑derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) transplantation on the development of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo generated, characterized and cultivated rat EPCs were identified by flow cytometry of their surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EPCs were transplanted intravenously into rats through the tail vein 6 weeks after they were challenged with STZ and the rats were sacrificed 4 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before sacrifice, left ventricular (LV) catheterization was performed to evaluate the cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardium sections were stained with Masson's trichrome staining to investigate myocardial collagen contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>Fibrosis</z:mp>-, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>- and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related gene expressions were analyzed by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of EPCs alleviated the impaired cardiac function associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and decreased the collagen volume in diabetic myocardium resulting in improved cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EPC transplantation decreased the expression of type I collagen, Bax, caspase-3 and p67phox, while increasing the expression of Bcl-2 and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that transplantation of EPCs improved cardiac function in the rat <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> model, likely through inhibition of cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
