<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was conducted of 599 pregnancies in 479 single pregnant women with congenital or acquired cardiac lesions or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relevant variables were compared between women who had PD35G (n=37) and the controls (n=562) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac dysfunction was defined as the appearance of clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo>, or cardiac ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PD37G occurred in 77 cases (12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous and indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> was 26 (33.8%) and 51 (66.2%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of cardiac dysfunction [odds ratio (OR) 21.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.3-57.49], New York Heart Association class II (OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.05-14.93), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (OR 7.74, 95% CI 1.69-35.45) and pregnancy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (PIH) (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.37-7.24) was significantly associated with an increased risk of PD35G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was seen within one year after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnancy and delivery are generally safe in WCD, it is necessary to be aware of the risk factors of cardiac dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and PIH from the aspect of PD35G </plain></SENT>
