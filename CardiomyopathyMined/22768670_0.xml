<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterised by severe metabolic and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> derangement, prenatal and postnatal linear growth impairment, soft tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and poor development of adipose tissue and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which is often within the first year of life, include intercurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and, in some cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management is currently based on case reports and very small case series only, and no formal guidelines or recommendations exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infant</z:e> who had typical features of DS but who later developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 10 weeks old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for the previously reported p.Arg890X nonsense mutation and the novel p.Tyr818Cys missense mutation in the INSR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine 818 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in an exquisitely conserved residue of the alphabeta fibronectin domain of the insulin receptor, whose structure and function are much less well understood than other parts of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss management options for DS, including the therapeutic dilemma around whether recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1, one of the few available treatments for the syndrome, may exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
