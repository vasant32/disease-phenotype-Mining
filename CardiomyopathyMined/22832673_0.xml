<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -There is considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the myocardial substrate of patients undergoing CRT, in particular in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and in the location of conduction block within the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may account for variability in response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New approaches including endocardial and multi-site LV stimulation may improve CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate these approaches using non-contact mapping to understand the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -10 patients (8M:2F), mean (SD) age 63(12) years, LVEF 24(6)%, QRS duration 161(24)ms fulfilling conventional CRT criteria underwent an electrophysiological study with assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response to conventional CRT as well as LV endocardial and multi-site pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV activation pattern was assessed using non-contact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV endocardial pacing gave a superior <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response compared to conventional CRT (26% vs 37% increase in LV dP/dt(max) respectively, p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards further incremental benefit from multi-site LV stimulation, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (71%) of patients with non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> etiology or functional block responded to conventional CRT, whereas those with myocardial scar or absence of functional block often required endocardial or multi-site pacing in order to achieve CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Endocardial or multi-site pacing may be required in certain subsets of patients undergoing CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and those with narrower QRS in particular may stand to benefit </plain></SENT>
