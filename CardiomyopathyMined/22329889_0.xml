<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant benefits of intracoronary injection of autologous stem cells on cardiac function and remodelling have been demonstrated in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experience with autologous stem cell therapy in children with severe congenital or acquired pump failure is limited to a small number of case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method and results Between 2006 and 2010, nine severely ill children were treated with intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells as part of a compassionate therapy in our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related unexpected adverse events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who died of haemorrhage unrelated to the procedure; three patients proceeded to heart transplantation once a donor heart became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other five patients showed an improvement with respect to New York Heart Association classification (greater than or equal to 1), brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> serum levels, and ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Similar to adults, intracoronary injection of autologous bone marrow cell is technically feasible and safe for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data, we propose to perform a pilot study for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, to formally assess the efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow cell therapy </plain></SENT>
