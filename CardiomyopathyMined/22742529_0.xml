<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has the potential to clarify the underlying pathology in patients with MINCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic value of CMR imaging in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The prospective, multicentre, observational Stockholm <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Coronaries (SMINC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Coronary care units in the Stockholm metropolitan area SUBJECTS: Patients between 35 and 70 years of age with MINCA were consecutively included in the screening phase of the SMINC study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a typical clinical presentation, fulfilling the universal definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary angiography finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with known structural or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> or other known causes of elevated troponin levels were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 176 patients with MINCA were screened from 2007 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 152 underwent CMR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The investigation was performed a median of 12 (interquartile range 6-28) days after hospital admission; 67% of the findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> whereas 19% of patients had signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> and 7% had signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (7%) had either unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or could not be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this consecutive series of patients with MINCA, CMR imaging may help to differentiate between those with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MINCA was higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After excluding cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, MINCA consists of a large group of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CMR imaging results and a smaller group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The aetiologies of these different imaging findings need to be explored. Â© 2012 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine </plain></SENT>
