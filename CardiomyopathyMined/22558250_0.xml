<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The targeting of Ca(2+) cycling has emerged as a potential therapy for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These approaches include gene therapy directed at overexpressing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase, or ablation of phospholamban (PLN) and associated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) protein complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that PP1β, one of the PP1 catalytic subunits, predominantly suppresses Ca(2+) uptake in the SR among the three PP1 isoforms, thereby contributing to Ca(2+) downregulation in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart-failure</z:hpo>-inducible PP1β-inhibition by adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-9 (AAV9) vector mediated gene therapy is beneficial for preventing disease progression in genetic cardiomyopathic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We created an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vector encoding PP1β short-hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) or negative control (NC) shRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> inducible gene expression system was employed using the B-type natriuretic protein (BNP) promoter conjugated to emerald-green fluorescence protein (EmGFP) and the shRNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AAV9 vectors (AAV9-BNP-EmGFP-PP1βshRNA and AAV9-BNP-EmGFP-NCshRNA) were injected into the tail vein (2×10(11) GC/mouse) of muscle LIM protein deficient mice (MLPKO), followed by serial analysis of echocardiography, hemodynamic measurement, biochemical and histological analysis at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the MLPKO mice, BNP promoter activity was shown to be increased by detecting both EmGFP expression and the induced reduction of PP1β by 25% in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inducible PP1βshRNA delivery preferentially ameliorated left ventricular diastolic function and mitigated adverse ventricular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PLN phosphorylation was significantly augmented in the AAV9-BNP-EmGFP-PP1βshRNA injected hearts compared with the AAV9-BNP-EmGFP-NCshRNA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BNP production was reduced, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005608'>cardiac interstitial fibrosis</z:mp> was abrogated at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo>-inducible molecular targeting of PP1β has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
