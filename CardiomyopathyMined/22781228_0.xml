<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: Previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> among children perinatally infected with HIV were conducted before the routine use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">Nucleoside</z:chebi> analogues (NRTIs), the backbone of HAART, have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity, which can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association of HAART and specific NRTIs associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity, on development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> among perinatally HIV-infected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN:: 3,035 perinatally HIV-infected children enrolled in a US-based multicenter prospective cohort study, were followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, defined as a clinical diagnosis or initiation of digoxin, from 1993-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Cox models were used to estimate the effects of HAART and NRTIs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, identify predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> among HAART users, and estimate the association between development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: 99 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were identified over follow-up (incidence rate: 5.6 cases per 1,000 person-years) at a median age of 9.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HAART was associated with a 50% lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> compared to no HAART use (95% confidence interval: 20%, 70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10101">Zalcitabine</z:chebi> (ddC) use, however, was associated with an 80% higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among HAART users, older age at HAART initiation, ddC use before HAART initiation, initiating a HAART regimen containing <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">zidovudine</z:chebi> (ZDV), and a nadir CD4&lt;15% were independently associated with a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was associated with a 6-fold higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: HAART has dramatically decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> among perinatally HIV-infected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, they remain at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and ongoing ZDV exposure may increase this risk </plain></SENT>
