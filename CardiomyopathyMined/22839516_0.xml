<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of 69 patients with nonobstructive form of the disease included echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The state of left atrium (LA) was studied by measurement of its systolic and diastolic longitudinal and transversal dimensions with calculation of main parameters of contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 60% of patients with HCM including those with nonobstuctive form we found spherical remodeling of LA with lowering of its contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coefficient of remodeling was suggested as ratio of transversal and longitudinal dimensions of its cavity </plain></SENT>
