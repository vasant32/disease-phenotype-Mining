<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Control Sprague Dawley (C) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic (D) rats were either untreated or treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks starting at 1 week after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free 15-F2t-isoprostane, a specific indicator of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was measured by enzymatic immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was assessed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained paraffin-embedded sections of LVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial collagens I and III were assessed by immunol histochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed to characterize cardiac structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In diabetic rats, both plasma and cardiac tissue levels of free 15-F2t-isoprostane were increased (p &lt; 0.05 vs. control), accompanied with significant increase (p &lt; 0.05 vs. control) in cross-section area and myocardial collagen deposition of LV cardiomyocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography in diabetic rats showed that LV weight/body weight ratio was significantly higher than in control rats, whereas the levels of LV end-diastolic volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume were decreased (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05 diabetic vs. control) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> can attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, ameliorate cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and subsequently prevent left ventricular dysfunction in early <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
