<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 46-year-old woman referred to our center for urgent heart transplantation assessment, initially diagnosed as having cardiogenic shock of uncertain etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some hours before she had suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> without regaining consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When she arrived at our hospital, the objective examination revealed bilateral unreactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> and absent brain-stem reflexes, and echocardiography showed global left ventricle wall hypokinesis sparing the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An urgent computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head was performed, which showed a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the following hours, she fulfilled the criteria of brain-stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and indeed became a multiorgan donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heart was rejected for transplantation because of the existence of left ventricle wall motion abnormalities associated with neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e> is a stress-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that occurs after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is especially frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, where it reaches an incidence of up to 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> and regional hypokinesis of the left ventricle wall not consistent with the coronary artery distribution, and is thought to be a transient condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this reason it should not constitute an absolute contraindication to cardiac donation in young donors with no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our hospital during the last year one third of the potential heart donors had regional left ventricle wall motion abnormalities compatible with neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With the aim of improving the number of cardiac donors, several strategies have been described to try to demonstrate the reversibility of this entity, such as dobutamine stress echocardiography </plain></SENT>
