<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding of the scaffold protein, talin, to the cytoplasmic tail of β integrin causes a conformational change of the extracellular domains of the integrin heterodimer, thus allowing high-affinity binding of ECM ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This essential process is called integrin activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ-motif containing protein (Zasp) cooperates with talin to activate α5β1 integrins in mammalian tissue culture and αPS2βPS integrins in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Zasp is a PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein mutated in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> previously thought to function primarily in assembly and maintenance of the muscle contractile machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, Zasp is the first protein shown to co-activate α5β1 integrins with talin and appears to do so in a manner distinct from known αIIbβ3 co-activators </plain></SENT>
