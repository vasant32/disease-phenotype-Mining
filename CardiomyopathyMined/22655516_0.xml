<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It results from defects in the subsarcolemmal protein dystrophin, a component of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex (DGC) which links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of dystrophin leads to muscle membrane fragility, muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and gradual replacement of skeletal muscle by fat and connective tissue, through a complex and still unclear cascade of interconnecting events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No cure is currently available, with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> being the sole drugs in clinical use in spite of their remarkable side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A great effort is devoted at performing pre-clinical tests on the mdx mouse, the mostly used homologous animal model for DMD, with the final aim to identify drugs safer than steroids and able to target the pathogenic mechanisms so to delay pathology progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review updates the efforts on this topic, focusing on the open issues about the animal model and highlighting the classes of pharmaceuticals that are more promising as disease-modifiers, while awaiting for more corrective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although caution is necessary in data transfer from mdx model to DMD patients, the implementation of standard operating procedures and the growing understanding of the pathology may allow a more accurate evaluation of therapeutics, alone or in combination, in pre-clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A continuous cross-talk with clinicians and patients associations are also crucial points for proper translation of data from mouse to bedside </plain></SENT>
