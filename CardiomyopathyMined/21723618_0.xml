<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Conventional scales may help with the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but are generally too lengthy for clinical practice and perform poorly against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the value of a single item <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi> Distress Thermometer and an enhanced visual-analogue method (Emotion Thermometers, ET) that incorporates four emotion thermometers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 228 patients with mixed cardiovascular conditions of whom 200 completed questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>64.5% suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, 9.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 4.5% had multiple cardiac diagnoses, 3% suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 2% had rhythm problem, 2% had valve problems and 1.5% were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria to define current <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the GAD7 to define current <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and the HADS-T to define distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>13% had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> and 19.1% had major or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV (any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also 59 people (29.6%) with clinically significant distress and 46 with clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The optimal accuracy for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was either the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> thermometer (DepT) or the Help thermometer (HelpT), as both performed well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.1%, 89.7% and 84.6%, 85.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DepT was also best for detecting any <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (sensitivity 68.4% and specificity 93.2%) and HAD-T based distress (sensitivity 79.7% and specificity 82.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> thermometer (AnxT) performed best against the GAD7 (sensitivity 84.8% and specificity 83.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Innovative visual-analogue screening tools for mood appear to perform well in cardiovascular settings </plain></SENT>
