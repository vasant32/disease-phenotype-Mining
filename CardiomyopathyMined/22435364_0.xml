<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) is characterized by progressive alteration of left ventricle structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous works on proteomic analysis in cardiac tissue from patients with HF remain scant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to use a proteomic approach to investigate variations in protein expression of left ventricle tissue from patients with ischaemic (ICM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four explanted human hearts, 12 from patients with ICM and 12 with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> undergoing cardiac transplantation and six non-diseased donor hearts (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>) were analysed by 2DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins of interest were identified by mass spectrometry and validated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We encountered 35 differentially regulated spots in the comparison <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> versus ICM, 33 in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and 34 in ICM versus <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5445">glyceraldehyde</z:chebi> 3-phophate dehydrogenase up-regulation in both ICM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and alpha-crystallin B down-regulation in both ICM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heat shock 70 protein 1 was up-regulated only in ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the eleven differentially regulated proteins common to both aetiologies are interconnected as a part of a same network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have shown by proteomics analysis that HF is associated with changes in proteins involved in the cellular stress response, respiratory chain and cardiac metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although we found altered expression of eleven proteins common to both ischaemic and dilated aetiology, we also observed different proteins altered in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we obtained that seven of these eleven proteins are involved in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> processes, and therefore in HF progression </plain></SENT>
