<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterised by a progressive right ventricle (RV) fibrofatty replacement, although biventricular replacement (BV) is also common </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study investigates the relationship between the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in myocardium and the severity of structural heart alterations in ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included eight control and 36 ARVC postmortem human heart samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed macroscopic assessment and microscopic analysis for different inflammatory cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fibrofatty replacement of RV was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases showed sole RV involvement (36.11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, only one showed inflammatory infiltrates (7.69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases showed severe ARVC phenotypic forms characterised by BV involvement and right auricular (RA) fatty accumulation plus RV dilation (44.44%); eight of them also showed inflammatory infiltrates (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies revealed ventricular multifocal inflammatory infiltrates, showing seven T-lymphocytes as the main infiltrate cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of inflammatory infiltrates in ventricular myocardium of ARVC samples is associated with severe structural heart changes, indicating that an inflammatory process may be a modulator of severity in ARVC </plain></SENT>
