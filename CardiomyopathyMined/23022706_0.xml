<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is listed among the former, since it is characterized by structural and functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001707'>abnormalities of the right ventricle</z:hpo> (RV), ranging from regional wall motion abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysms</z:hpo>, to global ventricular dilation and dysfunction, with or without left ventricular (LV) involvement(2-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture is usually dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, even at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in young people during effort(5-7), thus justifying the adjective "arrhythmogenic" </plain></SENT>
