<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complex I of the mammalian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain is a very large, 45 subunits enzyme, and functional deficiency of complex I is the most frequently observed cause of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Impairment of complex I results in decreased cellular energy production and is responsible for a variety of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342776" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Complex I deficiency</z:e> may be caused by mutations in any of the seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> or 38 nuclear genes that encode complex I subunits or by mutations in various other nuclear genes that affect complex I assembly or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse models that faithfully mimic human complex I disorders are needed to better understand the role of complex I in health and disease and for evaluation of potential therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review we discuss existing mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> complex I dysfunction, focusing on those with similarities to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss some of the noteworthy murine genetic models in which complex I genes are not disrupted, but complex I dysfunction is observed, along with some of the more popular <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi> that inhibit complex I function and are useful for modeling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342776" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complex I deficiency</z:e> in mice </plain></SENT>
