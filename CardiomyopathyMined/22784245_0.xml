<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both extracellular and intracellular alterations in proteolytic activities are invariably seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the function of several myocardial organelles such as sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrils, mitochondria, as well as extracellular matrix have been shown to be due to subcellular remodeling as a consequence of changes in gene expression and protein content in failing hearts from cardiomyopathic hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of the increased activities of various proteases, including calpains and matrix metalloproteinases in the hearts of genetically determined hamsters, it is proposed that the activation of different proteases may also represent an important determinant of subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction associated with genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
