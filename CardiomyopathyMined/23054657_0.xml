<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CFs mediate responses to hormonal and mechanical stimuli and relay these to other local cell types through release of autocrine and/or paracrine factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CFs also play important roles in the setting of injury, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, where ECM production is key to efficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, conditions exist in which excess production of ECM by CFs can lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two important pathways known to be involved in development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> are renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) receptor (RAGE) signaling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes actions of these two pathways on function of CFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> is an important component of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, we include new data that suggests a possible crosstalk between the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and AGE/RAGE pathway in order to activate CFs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
