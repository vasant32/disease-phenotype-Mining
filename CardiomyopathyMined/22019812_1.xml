<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> also occur in the absence of morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> at autopsy, and have been linked to ion channel mutations in a subset of cases, but so far not to PKP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 exons of PKP2 in DNA extracted from postmortem heart tissues of 25 patients dying from ARVC and 25 from sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with negative autopsy (SUDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primers were designed using the Primer Express 3.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing for both sense and antisense strands was performed with a BigDye Terminator DNA sequencing kit on a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation damage prediction was made using Mutation Taster, Polyphen and SIFT software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the 25 ARVC samples, 6 PKP2 mutations were identified, 4 of which were likely significant, and 3 of which were novel (p.N641del, p.L64PfsX22, p.G269R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the 25 cases of SUDNA samples, 6 PKP2 mutations were identified, 3 of which were likely significant, and 4 of which were not previously described (p.P665S, p.Y217TfsX45, p.E540, p.S615T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PKP2 mutations are not specific for ARVC and may result in SUDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The link between ARVC and desmosomal mutations may not be causal but related to an association between defective desmosomal proteins and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
