<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the predictive value of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for future cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The utility of LGE for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of LGE in HCM has been described in several studies, but controversy exists given the limited power of these studies to predict future events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched multiple databases including PubMed for studies of LGE in HCM that reported selected clinical outcomes (cardiovascular mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> [SCD], aborted SCD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to determine pooled odds ratios for these clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four studies evaluated 1,063 patients over an average follow-up of 3.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled prevalence of LGE was 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratios (OR) demonstrate that LGE by CMR correlated with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (pooled OR: 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 8.42; p = 0.047), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (pooled OR: 5.68, 95% CI: 1.04 to 31.07; p = 0.045), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (pooled OR: 4.46, 95% CI: 1.53 to 13.01; p = 0.006), and showed a trend toward significance for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>/aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (pooled OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 0.87 to 6.58; p = 0.091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The assessment of LGE by CMR has the potential to provide important information to improve risk stratification in HCM in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
