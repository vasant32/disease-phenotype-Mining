<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of 19 cases of near hanging admitted in our Emergency Department between January 2007 and December 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo>; ejection fraction on echocardiography, cardiac enzymes, mechanical ventilation; and use of inotropes, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, and steroids were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients developed clinical and radiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, among whom three had electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes that resolved before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> precipitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in four, while inotropes and mechanical ventilation were instituted in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>Pulmonary edema</z:hpo> can be due to neurogenic, cardiogenic, postobstructive causes or an interplay of the three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> seems more common than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>Pulmonary edema</z:hpo> occurred irrespective of level of consciousness or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> and was not associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Victims of near hanging with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> can be effectively treated with supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
