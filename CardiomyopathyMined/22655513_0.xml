<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereupon, we immediately established the techniques at our home universities, first at the Technische Universität Aachen and, from 1999 on, at the Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since then, we have applied the technique to more than 500 DMD patients in total by performing more than 800 operations on the lower limbs and/or spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In support of findings reported by Professor Rideau in this issue we observed that, where patients are still ambulatory at the time of operation, the operation delays the point at which patients become wheelchair-bound by about two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, patients receiving this treatment were/are also able to perform the Gowers' manoeuvre for around two years longer </plain></SENT>
