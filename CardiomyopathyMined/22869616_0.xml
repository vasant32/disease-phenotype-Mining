<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of cardiac fibroblasts to glycated collagens mediates the differentiation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts, which may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>.Methods and ResultsBy microarray we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi>-treated collagen selectively enhanced α11 integrin expression in human cardiac fibroblasts while levels of other collagen binding integrins (α1, α2 and α10) were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar increases of α11 integrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were observed in cardiac fibroblasts from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated Sprague Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human cardiac fibroblasts plated on methyglyoxal-treated collagen and in cardiac fibroblasts from diabetic rats, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 but not TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 was increased compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knock down of α11 integrin and TGF-β receptors with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> blocked the increased expression of TGF-β, α-smooth muscle actin and α11 integrin that were induced in cells plated on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi>-treated collagen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interactions between α11 integrins and the Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling may contribute to the formation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts and the development of a fibrotic interstitium in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
