<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sarcomeric dysfunction has been ascribed to changes in phosphorylation status of sarcomeric proteins caused by an altered balance between intracellular kinases and phosphatases during the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present review we discuss changes in phosphorylation of the thick filament protein myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) reported in failing myocardium, with emphasis on phosphorylation changes observed in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by mutations in MYBPC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we will discuss assays which allow to distinguish between functional consequences of mutant sarcomeric proteins and (mal)adaptive changes in sarcomeric protein phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
