<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the ability of CMR to visualize myocardial injuries over the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 42 patients (39 males, 3 females; age 37 ± 14 years) with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and after 12 ±��9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CMR included function analyses, T2-weighted imaging (T2 ratio), T1-weighted imaging before and after i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> injection (global relative enhancement; gRE), and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, the T2 ratio was elevated in 57%, gRE in 31%, and LGE was present in 64% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 32 patients (76%) were any two (or more) out of three sequences abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, there was an increase in ejection fraction (57.4 ± 11.9% vs. 61.4 ± 7.6; P &lt; 0.05) while both T2 ratio (2.04 ± 0.32 vs. 1.70 ± 0.28; P &lt; 0.001) and gRE (4.07 ± 1.63 vs. 3.11 ± 1.22; P &lt; 0.05) significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LGE persisted in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was present in 3 patients and 4 patients received a defibrillator or a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive CMR approach is a useful tool to visualize myocardial tissue injuries over the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CMR may help to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> from healed <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, and add information for the differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
