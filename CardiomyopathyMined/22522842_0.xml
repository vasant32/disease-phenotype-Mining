<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) have confirmed surgical myectomy as the gold standard for non-pharmacological treatment of obstructive HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, during the last 15 years, an extensive use of alcohol septal ablation has led to the virtual extinction of myectomy programmes in several European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, many HCM candidates for myectomy in Europe cannot be offered the option of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study is to report the difficulties and results in developing a myectomy programme for HCM in a centre without previous experience with this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical course is reported of 124 consecutive patients with obstructive HCM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms who underwent myectomy at a single European centre between 1996 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 20.3 months (inter-quartile range: 3.9-40.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cumulative incidence of HCM-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after myectomy was 0.8, 3.3, and 11.2% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, including one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (procedural mortality 0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular (LV) outflow gradient decreased from 95 ± 36 mmHg before surgery to 12 ± 6 mmHg at most recent evaluation (P &lt; 0.001), with none of the patients having a significant residual LV outflow gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV before surgery, 93 (96%) were in class I-II at most recent evaluation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that the development of a myectomy programme at a centre without previous experience with this procedure is feasible and can lead to highly favourable clinical results </plain></SENT>
