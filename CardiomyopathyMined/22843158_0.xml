<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with emotional or physical stress usually in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major pathogenetic role is played by excessive sympathetic stimulation of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two cases of TTC have been described in patients on hemodialysis and one case has been described in a patient on peritoneal dialysis associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a case of TTC in a patient on nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis with a transplanted kidney and loss of residual renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that she had suffered significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> immediately before the symptoms arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical features were typical ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beta-blockers were the principal pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The necessary ultrafiltration was obtained with peritoneal dialysis in automated modality, reducing the abdominal filling volumes according to the patient's compliance and modifying the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration according to her hemodynamic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The obtained ultrafiltration was appropriate and in accordance with the few experiences reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The symptoms resolved within a week and the left ventricular kinesis and ejection fraction normalized in almost three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This clinical case suggests that peritoneal dialysis, also in automated mode, can be as effective as extracorporeal ultrafiltration in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
