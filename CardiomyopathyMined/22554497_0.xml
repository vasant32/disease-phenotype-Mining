<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been defined as a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in the month preceding or following delivery, without demonstrated aetiology nor previously known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and with echocardiographic evidences of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (LV ejection fraction&lt;0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It's a multifactorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, immunologic</z:e>, hormonal, and possibly <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> mechanisms playing a determinant pathophysiological role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The classical clinical presentation is a rapid and unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in a previously healthy woman, echocardiography being the key examination for positive and differential diagnosis, prognostication, therapeutic decision-making, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential severity of PPCMP, and its unpredictable evolution in the first days following diagnosis, require that patients be referred to a tertiary care centre with a high skill in intensive cardiology care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic management of PPCMP does not offer any specificity when compared to other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> to extracorporeal life support), except for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE-inhibitors</z:chebi>, that are contraindicated before delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of thrombo-embolic complications observed in the disease requires however rapid and curative anticoagulation, and immuno-suppressive treatment has been proposed in fulminant and highly inflammatory presentation, but its efficacy remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very recently, promising results have been reported with bromocriptin-a prolactin secretion inhibitor-for reducing 6-month morbidity and mortality, but these findings have to be confirmed in larger scale randomised trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for the long-term evolution, approximately half of the patients will heal, while half of the women will keep some degree of LV dysfunction, 25% of them developing moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
