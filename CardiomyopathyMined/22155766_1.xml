<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, the techniques available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> diagnosis are very sensitive; however, they do not allow discrimination of the patient's clinical stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper describes that three out of the five different repeats contained in the Trypanosoma cruzi TcCA-2 membrane protein (3972-FGQAAAGDKPPP, 6303-FGQAAAGDKPAP, and 3973-FGQAAAGDKPSL) are recognized with high sensitivity (&gt;90%) by sera from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> patients and that they are not recognized by sera from patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 133 serum samples from chagasic patients and 50 serum samples from healthy donors were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, sera from 15 patients with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, 43 serum samples from patients suffering an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, and 38 serum samples from patients with nonchagasic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> were also included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The residue 3973 peptide shows a specificity of &gt;98%, as it is not recognized by individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory processes or by patients with a nonchagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the levels of antibody against the 3973 epitope detected by the sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> patients in the symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, involving cardiac or digestive alterations, are higher than those detected by the sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> patients in the indeterminate phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the diagnostic technique described could also be used to indicate the degree of pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amino acids F, Q, and DKP located in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at positions 1, 3, and 8 to 10, respectively, are essential to conform to the immunodominant antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
