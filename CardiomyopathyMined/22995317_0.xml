<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), a prominent cardiovascular complication, has been recognized as a microvascular disease that may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the past few decades, research progress has been made in investigating the pathophysiology of the disease; however, the exact molecular mechanism has not been elucidated, making therapeutic a difficult task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review article, we have discussed a number of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced metabolites such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, advanced glycation end products, protein kinase C, free fatty acid and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and other related factors that are implicated in the pathophysiology of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An understanding of the biochemical and molecular changes especially early in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> may lead to new and effective therapies towards prevention and amelioration of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, which is important for the millions of individuals who already have or are likely to develop the disease before a cure becomes available </plain></SENT>
