<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (CMS) is a severe disease of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) associated with significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMS is diagnosed with a severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and degradation of myocardial tissue caused by a double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> virus named piscine <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> virus (PMCV), with structural similarities to the Totiviridae family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we characterized individual host responses and genomic determinants of different disease outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From time course studies of experimentally infected Atlantic salmon post-smolts, fish exhibited different outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High responder (HR) fish were characterized with sustained and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load and pathology in heart tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low responder (LR) fish showed declining <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load from 6-10â€‰weeks post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (wpi) and absence of pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global gene expression (SIQ2.0 oligonucleotide microarray) in HR and LR hearts during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was compared, in order to characterize differences in the host response and to identify genes with expression patterns that could explain or predict the different outcomes of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Virus-responsive genes involved in early antiviral and innate immune responses were upregulated equally in LR and HR at the first stage (2-4 wpi), reflecting the initial increase in virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repression of heart muscle development was identified by gene ontology enrichment analyses, indicating the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By six weeks both responder groups had comparable <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, while increased pathology was observed in HR fish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was reflected by induced expression of genes implicated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms, presumably related to lymphocyte regulation and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LR fish showed earlier activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-like receptor signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the late stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, increased pathology and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load in HR was accompanied by a broad activation of genes involved in adaptive immunity and particularly T cell responses, probably reflecting the increased infiltration and homing of virus-specific T cells to the infected heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was in sharp contrast to LR fish, where recovery and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load was associated with a significantly reduced transcription of adaptive immunity genes and activation of genes involved in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to LR, a stronger and sustained expression of genes involved in adaptive immune responses in heart tissue of HR at the late stage of disease probably reflected the increased lymphocyte infiltration and pathological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition to controlled adaptive immunity and activation of genes involved in cardiac energy metabolism in LR at the late stage, recovery of this group could also be related to an earlier activation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-like receptor signaling and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways </plain></SENT>
