<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical routine, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the standard first-line technique and is commonly used for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined how CMR-derived measurement of left ventricular (LV) chamber dimensions and wall thickness correspond to TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 101 subjects underwent TTE and CMR (men, n = 67, mean age 62 ± 9 years) and formed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (n = 44), a group with dilated LV cavity (n = 33; LV internal dimensions in end-diastole ≥ 52 mm) and a group with increased LV wall thickness (n = 24; interventricular septum ≥ 12 mm, inferolateral wall both in end-diastole ≥ 12 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard TTE measurements of LV chamber and wall thickness were compared to CMR-derived values in the basal short-axis slice and the 3-chamber (3-CH) view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interstudy reproducibility for CMR was done in 23 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, there was a better agreement between TTE and 3-CH for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intraobserver and interobserver agreements were superior for 3-CH view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, both CMR approaches showed sound interstudy reproducibility for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a good agreement between CMR and TTE in LV chamber dimension and wall thickness measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that with CMR using a 3-CH approach is superior in reproducibility and closer in concordance with TTE-derived values </plain></SENT>
