<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen rats in the Adriamycin group underwent 8 weeks of Adriamycin treatment (2.5 mg/kg, twice per week; i.v.) to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg, per day, orally) and i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adriamycin simultaneously for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen untreated rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function were quantified using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>mTOR and p70S6K1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were assessed using reverse transcription-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results Collagen volume fraction (CVF) was significantly elevated in the adriamycin group (3.36 ± 0.75) compared with controls (1.51 ± 0.31), whereas mTOR and p70S6K <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were significantly increased in the adriamycin group (0.68 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ± 0.03) compared with controls (0.38 ± 0.03 and 0.34 ± 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Adriamycin group was associated with cardiac dilation and decreased contractile function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> group showed significantly decreased CVF (1.87 ± 0.45), accompanied with a significant decrease in mTOR and p70S6K <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (0.42 ± 0.05 and 0.45 ± 0.04) relative to the Adriamycin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> recovered impairments in cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function.Conclusion The mTOR/p70S6K pathway plays an important role in adriamycin-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> is a potential therapeutic treatment that can be used to attenuate <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> and improve cardiac function </plain></SENT>
