<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The heart derives energy from a wide variety of substrates including fatty acids, carbohydrates, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketones</z:chebi>, and amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The healthy heart generates up to 30% of its ATP from <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of cardiac injury or stress, the heart relies even more heavily on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as a source of fuel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> is transported into the heart by members of the family of facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters (GLUTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While research examining the transport of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into the heart has primarily focused on the roles of the classical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, little is known about the functions of more newly identified GLUT isoforms in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study the presence and relative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> message abundance of each of the known GLUT isoforms was determined in left ventricular tissue from two commonly used inbred laboratory mouse strains (C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ) by quantitative real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative message abundance was also determined in GLUT4 null mice and in murine models of dilated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GLUT4, GLUT1, and GLUT8 were found to be the most abundant GLUT transcripts in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart, while GLUT3, GLUT10, and GLUT12 are present at relatively lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assessment of relative GLUT expression in left ventricular myocardium from mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> revealed increased expression of GLUT1 with reduced levels of GLUT4, GLUT8, and GLUT12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compensatory increase in the expression of GLUT12 was observed in genetically altered mice lacking GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> transporter expression varies significantly among murine models of cardiac dysfunction and involves several of the class III GLUT isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Understanding how these more newly identified GLUT isoforms contribute to regulating myocardial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport will enhance our comprehension of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology of the heart </plain></SENT>
