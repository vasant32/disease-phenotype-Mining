<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of TPO for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) in a rat model and explored the mechanisms in terms of the genome-wide transcriptional profile, TPO downstream protein signals, and bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: Sham-operated, MI (permanent ligation of the left coronary artery) and MI+TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three doses of TPO were administered weekly for 2weeks, and outcomes were assessed at 4 or 8weeks post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TPO treatment significantly improved left ventricular function, hemodynamic parameters, myocardium <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, neovascularization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MI damage upregulated a large cohort of gene expressions in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone, including those functioned in cytoskeleton organization, vascular and matrix remodeling, muscle development, cell cycling and ion transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TPO treatment significantly reversed these modulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While phosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and protein kinase B (AKT) was modified in MI animals, TPO treatment regulated phosphorylation of STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TPO also increased EPC colonies in the bone marrow of MI animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that TPO alleviated damages of heart tissues from MI insults, possibly mediated by multi-factorial mechanisms including suppression of over-reacted ventricular remodeling, regulation of TPO downstream signals and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TPO could be developed for treatment of cardiac damages </plain></SENT>
