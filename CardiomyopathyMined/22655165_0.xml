<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMRI images are now of a sufficiently robust quality to enable high spatial and temporal resolution image acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to CMRI becoming an effective non-invasive imaging tool for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this two-part review we outline the typical sequences used to image <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and present the imaging spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Part I focused on the current classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, the basic CMRI sequences used in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the imaging spectrum of common phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Part II illustrates the imaging spectrum of the more rare phenotypes </plain></SENT>
