<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The overwhelming majority of patients with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (SC) are postmenopausal women, suggesting an important pathophysiologic role of the female sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e> might be provoked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that, compared with age- and gender-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) or patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries, patients with SC would exhibit altered levels of sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we aimed to describe the clinical course and the pattern of sex hormones of the SC patients during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples obtained on hospital admission were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (P), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women with SC (n = 17), age-matched women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI (n = 16), and women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six years after the initial event, SC patients underwent a clinical and echocardiographic follow-up and reassessment of sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> concentrations at hospital admission were significantly higher in the SC group compared with the MI and the control groups, with no difference in P, FSH, and LH concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up E2 after 6 years in SC patients was lower than during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SC episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up P in these patients was lower than P in the MI and control groups during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event, with a similar trend for E2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> occurred and 2 patients suffered from SC recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event, E2 concentrations are elevated in postmenopausal SC patients compared with women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The higher E2 concentrations might have exerted atheroprotective effects and thus diverted the stress response to SC rather than MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> remains a potential risk of SC </plain></SENT>
