<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> and ventricular dyssynchrony are frequent findings in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies focused on patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; however, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> and ventricular dyssynchrony at presentation and their role in perpetuating left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those studies of individuals with long-standing <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> did not characterize patients early in the disease course, and may not have included those with significant improvement in LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus factors contributing to LV recovery are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> [LV ejection fraction (EF) ≤45%] made within the preceding 2 weeks were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent LGE-CMR, echocardiography, 6-minute walk testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and blood sampling for measurement of serum amino-terminal pro-brain natiuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-pro-BNP) concentration at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline patient characteristics were compared with a cohort of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> by LGE-CMR was quantified, identified by experienced observers blinded to patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic function was reassessed after 5 months of optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and 19 healthy volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients were studied a median 12.5 days following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy controls, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients exhibited greater inter- and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four per cent of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients exhibited LGE at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with LGE, the mean <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> mass was 2.2 ± 1.3 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, strain dyssynchrony index, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> mass were independently associated with change in the LVEF over time (P≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Late-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance conferred additive value for modelling change in the LVEF beyond clinical and echocardiographic dyssynchrony parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is independently associated with lack of response to medical therapy in new-presentation <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and LGE-CMR may thus be an important risk-stratifying investigation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Accurate risk stratification may permit more targeted pharmacological and device therapies for patients with newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
