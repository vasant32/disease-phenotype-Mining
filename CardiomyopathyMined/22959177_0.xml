<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the performance of treadmill exercise Doppler echocardiography in the prediction of functional limitations in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> underwent treadmill exercise echocardiography with direct measurement of oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both at rest and at peak exercise, the mitral inflow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and mitral annulus velocities were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three patients developed left ventricular outflow tract obstruction during exercise, which significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005290'>decreased oxygen consumption</z:mp> (21.3 [5.7] mL/kg/min vs 24.6 [6.1] mL/kg/min; P=.012), and had greater left atrial volume (42.1 [14.5] mL/m(2) vs 31.1 [11.6] mL/m(2); P&lt;.001) and a higher degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and E/E' ratio during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise variables improved the predictive value of functional capacity (adjusted R(2) rose from 0.38 to 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of oxygen consumption were age, left atrial volume, E/E' ratio and the presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular outflow obstruction</z:e>, only left ventricular and atrial volume indexes were independent predictors of exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and left atrial volume are the main predictors of exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exercise echocardiography is a better predictor of functional performance than at-rest echocardiography, although its predictive power is under 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In nonobstructed patients, left atrial and ventricular volumes were the independent factors </plain></SENT>
