<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCM is characterized by a wide range of clinical expression, ranging from asymptomatic mutation carriers to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> as the first manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 1000 mutations have been identified, classically in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging is central to the diagnosis of HCM and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is increasingly used to characterize morphologic, functional and tissue abnormalities associated with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical, pathological and imaging features relevant to understanding the diagnosis of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early and overt phenotypic expression of disease that may be identified by CMR is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction may be an early marker of the disease, present in mutation carriers prior to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement by CMR is present in approximately 60% of HCM patients with LVH and may provide novel information regarding risk stratification in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that integrating genetic advances with enhanced phenotypic characterization of HCM with novel CMR techniques will importantly improve our understanding of this complex disease </plain></SENT>
