<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is a nonischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that microvascular dysfunction reflected by an impaired myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to stress is present in patients with other forms of nonischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and that the reduced MBF may be related to a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we quantified MBF, coronary flow reserve and coronary vascular resistance in patients with nonfailing ARVC using H(2)(15)O and PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In ten male patients with ARVC (mean age 49 ± 14 years), MBF was quantified at rest and during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced hyperaemia using H(2)(15)O PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those obtained in 20 age-matched healthy male control subjects (mean age 46 ± 14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resting MBF was not significantly different between patients with ARVC and controls (MBF(rest) 1.19 ± 0.29 vs. 1.12 ± 0.20 ml/min/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, hyperaemic MBF was significantly lower in patients with ARVC than in controls (2.60 ± 0.96 vs. 3.68 ± 0.84 ml/min/ml; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, patients with ARVC had a significantly lower coronary flow reserve than control subjects (2.41 ± 1.34 vs. 3.39 ± 0.93; p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, hyperaemic coronary vascular resistance was increased in patients with ARVC (36.79 ± 12.91 vs. 26.31 ± 6.49 mmHg × ml(-1) × min × ml; p = 0.007), but was found to be unchanged at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small well-characterized cohort of patients with nonfailing ARVC, we found a significantly reduced hyperaemic MBF and increased coronary vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to corroborate this potential new functional aspect of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARVC </plain></SENT>
