<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric age group, HRV has been investigated in healthy children, diabetics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome of the newborn, and sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate HRV in pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to compare it with that of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study evaluated 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>: 11 females (mean age, 7 ± 4 years; range, 2-17 years) and 10 males (mean age, 10 ± 6 years; range, 2-18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) was diagnosed according to commonly accepted criteria after a noninvasive cardiologic examination, echocardiography, and 24-h Holter monitoring (MR45 and MR45-3 Oxford recorder) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into six groups according to age, sex, and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability was recorded and analyzed in the time domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> showed an abnormal HRV pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly in the 5-6-year-old male patient group, the HRV values <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were significantly increased (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 2-6-year-old female patient group, the mean cycle length, the standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus R-R intervals during 24 h (SDNN), and the standard deviation of the average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus R-R intervals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5-min segments (SDANN) were significantly increased (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 13-18-year-old female patient group showed a significant reduction in SDNN and the mean of the standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus R-R intervals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5-min segments (SDNNi) (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The modification of the HRV pattern in the time domain, partially age- and gender-dependent modification, may reflect an imbalance of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in children who show a delayed or reduced activity, such as pediatric patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
