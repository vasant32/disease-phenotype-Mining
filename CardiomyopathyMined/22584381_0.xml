<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">Epigallocatechin-3-gallate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>), the most abundant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> in green tea (GT), inhibits fibril formation from several amyloidogenic proteins in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, it might also halt progression of TTR <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a single-center observational report on the effects of GT consumption in patients with ATTR cardiomopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 19 patients with ATTR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were evaluated by standard blood tests, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI (n = 9) before and after consumption of GT and/or green tea extracts (GTE) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were not followed up for reasons of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 2), discontinuation of GT/GTE consumption (n = 2), and heart transplantation (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 months no increase of left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and LV myocardial mass was observed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients evaluated by cardiac MRI a mean decrease of LV myocardial mass (-12.5 %) was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by an increase of mean mitral annular systolic velocity of 9 % in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol (191.9 ± 8.9 vs. 172.7 ±��9.4 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (105.8 ± 7.6 vs. 89.5 ± 8.0 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01) decreased significantly during the observational period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse effects were reported by any of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggests an inhibitory effect of GT and/or GTE on the progression of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose a randomized placebo-controlled investigation to confirm our observation </plain></SENT>
