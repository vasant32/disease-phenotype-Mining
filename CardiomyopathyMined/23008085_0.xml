<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of NCCM is heterogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis can be made using echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for NCCM are still under discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Afflicted patients may present with various symptoms caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and cardioembolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severely reduced LV function as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were shown to be linked to worse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment in patients with NCCM should be targeted at individual symptoms and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapy includes pharmacological treatment, and in individual cases ablation or device therapy, as well as consideration for heart transplantation in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aside from regular clinical follow-up of patients with NCCM screening of first degree family members with assessment of medical history, physical examination, ECG recording, and echocardiography are recommended </plain></SENT>
