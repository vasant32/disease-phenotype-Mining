<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CRT reduces morbidity and mortality due to the proper selection of candidates for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 12-month trial was performed on 70 optimally medicated patients with standard inclusion criteria: NYHA class III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, and QRS ≥ 120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters were evaluated by conventional and tissue Doppler-based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indicator of positive CRT response was more than 20% in improvement of LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LVEF increased &gt;20% in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of 43 tested baseline echocardiographic parameters, 12 showed statistical difference between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of these 12 parameters, six (LVSV, LVSI, LVFS, RVd, VPMR, and PISA) had modest to moderately good ability to predict LVEF response with sensitivity ranging from 62.2% to 82.4%, and specificity ranging from 56.5% to 81.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For those parameters, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for positive response to CRT was ≤0.76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis resulted in selection of LVSI and LVFS as possible predictive independent parameters for a good response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value for LVSI was 38.7 mL/m(2) (P = 0.045) and for LVFS was 13% (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contribution of LVSI and LVFS is to be confirmed in larger trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Simplicity of their assessment by conventional echocardiography could be an argument for adding them to the inclusion criteria for CRT in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
