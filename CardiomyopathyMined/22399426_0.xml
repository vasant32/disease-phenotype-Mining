<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP supply needs to be matched to the often sudden changes in ATP demand of the heart, and this is mediated to a large extent by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Ca(2+) transport pathways allowing elevation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In turn this activates dehydrogenase enzymes to increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> and hence ATP supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, [Ca(2+)](m) is also important in generation of reactive oxygen species, and in opening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (MPTP); factors involved in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MPTP has proved a promising target for protective strategies, with inhibitors widely used to show cardioprotection in experimental, and very recently human, studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly mitochondrially-targeted <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> have proved protective in various animal models of disease and await clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Ca(2+) transport pathways, although in theory promising therapeutic targets, cannot yet be targeted in human studies due to non-specific effects of drugs used experimentally to inhibit them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> due to mutations in mtDNA have been identified, usually in a gene for a tRNA, which, although rare, are almost always very severe once the mutation has exceeded its threshold </plain></SENT>
