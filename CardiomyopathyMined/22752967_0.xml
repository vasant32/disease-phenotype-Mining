<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>miR-499 expression varies in human disease, but results of mouse cardiac miR-499 overexpression are inconsistent, either protecting against ischemic damage or aggravating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after pressure overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there is disagreement over direct and indirect cardiac <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> targeted in vivo by miR-499 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective: To define the associations between regulated miR-499 level in clinical and experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and modulation of its predicted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> targets and to determine the consequences of increased cardiac miR-499 on direct <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> targeting, indirect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> modulation, and on myocardial protein content and posttranslational modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: miR-499 levels were increased in failing and hypertrophied human hearts and associated with decreased levels of predicted target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, miR-499 is increased in Gq-mediated murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forced cardiomyocyte expression of miR-499 at levels comparable to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> induced progressive murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and exacerbated cardiac remodeling after pressure overloading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-induced silencing complex and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequencing identified 67 direct, and numerous indirect, cardiac <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> targets, including Akt and MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocardial proteomics identified alterations in protein phosphorylation linked to the miR-499 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> phenotype, including of heat shock protein 90 and protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1-Î± </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: miR-499 is increased in human and murine <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, is sufficient to cause murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and accelerates maladaptation to pressure overloading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effects of miR-499 reflect the cumulative consequences of direct and indirect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> regulation, modulation of cardiac kinase and phosphatase pathways, and higher-order effects on posttranslational modification of myocardial proteins </plain></SENT>
