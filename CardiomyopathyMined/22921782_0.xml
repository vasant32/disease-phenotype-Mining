<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to explore unknown genetic factors affecting the disease phenotype of monogenic inherited human <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Knock-in mice bearing a sarcomeric protein mutation that causes <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were created on different genetic backgrounds; BALB/c and C57Bl/6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice on the BALB/c background showed cardiac enlargement and systolic dysfunction and developed congestive HF before died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice on the C57Bl/6 background developed no overt HF symptoms and died suddenly, although they showed considerable cardiac enlargement and systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BALB/c mice have brain <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> dysfunction due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> dysfunction plays a critical role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and BALB/c mice exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>-related behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is common and associated with poor prognosis in HF patients, we examined therapeutic effects of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3223">buspirone</z:chebi> that could improve the brain <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> function in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both drugs reduced cardiac enlargement and improved systolic dysfunction and symptoms of severe congestive HF in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice on the BALB/c background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that genetic backgrounds involving brain <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> dysfunction, such as TPH2 gene SNP, may play an important role in the development of congestive HF in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
