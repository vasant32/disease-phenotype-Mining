<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hereby proposed and developed shear wave imaging (SWI), which is an echocardiography-based, noninvasive, real-time, and easy-to-use technique, to map myofiber orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five in vitro porcine and three in vivo open-chest ovine hearts were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Known in physics, shear wave propagates faster along than across the fiber direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SWI is a technique that can generate shear waves travelling in different directions with respect to each myocardial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SWI further analyzed the shear wave velocity across the entire left-ventricular (LV) myocardial thickness, ranging between 10 (diastole) and 25 mm (systole), with a resolution of 0.2 mm in the middle segment of the LV anterior wall region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fiber angle at each myocardial layer was thus estimated by finding the maximum shear wave speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro porcine myocardium (n=5) , the SWI-estimated fiber angles gradually changed from +80° ± 7° (endocardium) to +30° ± 13° (midwall) and -40° ± 10° (epicardium) with 0° aligning with the circumference of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This transmural fiber orientation was well correlated with histology findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SWI further succeeded in mapping the transmural fiber orientation in three beating ovine hearts in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At midsystole, the average fiber orientation exhibited 71° ± 13° (endocardium), 27° ± 8° (midwall), and -26° ± 30° (epicardium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the capability of SWI in mapping myocardial fiber orientation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SWI may serve as a new tool for the noninvasive characterization of myocardial fiber structure </plain></SENT>
