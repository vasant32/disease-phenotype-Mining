<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the use of late enhancement imaging has matured and the span of applications has widened, the demands on image quality have grown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characterization of subendocardial MI now includes the accurate quantification of scar size, shape, and characterization of borders which have been shown to have prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As clinicians are examining late enhancement images for more subtle indication of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, the demand for lower artifacts has increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A range of new techniques have emerged to improve the speed and quality of late enhancement imaging including: methods for acquisition during free breathing, and fat water separated imaging for characterizing fibrofatty infiltration and reduction of artifacts related to the presence of fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review will be to describe the current state of the art and to provide a guide to various clinical protocols that are commonly used </plain></SENT>
