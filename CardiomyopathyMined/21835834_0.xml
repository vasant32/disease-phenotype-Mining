<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors aimed to provide this information for infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> in a defined population over a 22-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The regional paediatric cardiology database in Newcastle upon Tyne provided information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiovascular anomalies, surgical treatment and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was subdivided into two eras, 1985-1995 and 1996-2006, and surgical results and outcomes compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on live births with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> were obtained from the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey (NorCAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Denominator data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> live births in the region were obtained from UK Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1985-2006 there were 754,486 live births in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>821 infants were live-born with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> (1.09 per 1000 live births) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>342 (42%) infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> had a cardiovascular anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest anomaly was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001674'>complete atrioventricular septal defect</z:hpo> in 125 (37%) infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had univentricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 1985-1995, 101/163 (62%) infants had surgery with 30% mortality; in 1996-2006, 129/180 (72%) had surgery with 5% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent Fontan completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were two cardiac transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One-year survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> with a cardiovascular anomaly improved from 82% in 1985-1995 to 94% in 1996-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cardiovascular anomalies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There has been a significant reduction in postoperative mortality and improvement in 1-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> palliation and cardiac transplantation are now considered in these patients </plain></SENT>
