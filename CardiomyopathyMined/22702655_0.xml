<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been described in the literature, largely in Caucasians, which is independent of other risk factors, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cardiac changes in acromegalics of significant ethnic diversity and also the relevance of the aetiopathogenic factors involved, such as disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study with a comparative control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods: In this study, 37 acromegalic patients (20 Intermediate-skinned (IS), 14 Dark-skinned (DS) and 3 Light-skinned (LS) individuals) and 74 controls matched by age, gender and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function were addressed using echocardiography parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 46.9 ± 12.8 years, with 67.6% being female and 43.2% hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) between acromegalics was 56.8% versus 10.8% in the controls (p&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 86% of patients with LVH had active disease (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression revealed that disease activity presented a stronger association (OR = 5.925; CI = 1.085 - 32.351; p = 0.040) with LVH than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 3.237; CI = 0.702 - 14.924; p = 0.132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When DS acromegalics were compared to IS ones, no statistically significant differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chronically <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> somatotropic axis remains as an independent and determining factor in the development of LVH, as it is more associated with this condition than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in a largely admixed population with a high degree of African ancestry © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </plain></SENT>
