<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 25-35% of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients show familial forms of the disease, with most mutations affecting genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-related mutations fall in the Lamin AC gene, in particular in the Coil2B domain of the encoded protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, we focussed our studies on the crystal structures of two lamin Coil2B domain mutants (R335W and E347K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both R335 and E347 are higly conserved residues whose substitution has little effects on the Coil2B domain three-dimensional structure; we can thus hypothesize that the mutations may interfere with the binding of components within the nuclear lamina, or of nuclear factors, that have been proposed to interact/associate with lamin A/C </plain></SENT>
