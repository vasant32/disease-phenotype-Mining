<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While they have been historically overlooked in terms of functional contributions to development and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, cardiac fibroblasts are now front and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are currently recognized as key protagonists during both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> disease, and work together with cardiomyocytes through paracrine, structural, and potentially electrical interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of specific biomarkers and fibroblast <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature currently convolutes the study of this dynamic cell lineage; though, efforts to advance marker analysis and lineage mapping technologies are ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These tools will help elucidate the functional significance of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte interactions in vivo and delineate the dynamic nature of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological cardiac fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since therapeutic promise lies in understanding the interface between developmental biology and the postnatal injury response, future studies to understand the divergent roles played by cardiac fibroblasts both in utero and following cardiac insult are essential </plain></SENT>
