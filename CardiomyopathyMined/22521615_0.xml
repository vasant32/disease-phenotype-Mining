<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to illustrate the histogenesis, lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes electrophoresis, and DNA damage of cardiac muscles and blood vessels during prenatal life of maternal diabetic or hypercholesterolemic mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty fertile male and virgin female Wistar rats (1 male/3 females), weighing approximately 130 g, were mated and zero date of gestation was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced at the fifth day of gestation by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 60 mg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>/kg body weight in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> buffer, pH 4.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was carried out by feeding virgin rats a diet containing 3% cholesterol for 6 wk before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pregnant rats were arranged into three groups: control, diabetic, and hypercholesterolemic (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed and embryos were separated at 7-, 13-, 15-, 17-, and 19 d old, respectively, and subjected to light and transmission electron microscopy, lactic dehydrogenases isoenzymes electrophoresis, DNA fragmentation, and comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sera of the mothers were examined for fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers exhibited a significant increase of sera cholesterol level, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologic findings of embryos of diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and malformation of blood vessels with an apparent degeneration of their endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy possessed massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of muscle fibers, disorganization of Z and I bands, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lactic dehydrogenase isoenzyme electrophoresis was altered and genomic DNA fragmentation was markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>Maternal diabetes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> led to marked alterations in blood vessel differentiation as well as to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> during prenatal growth as assessed by the disruption of fine structures, abnormal lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes electrophoresis, and an increase of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These may be attributed to the marked <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and liberation of free oxygen radicals, which interrupted the myocardium structure and function during organogenesis </plain></SENT>
