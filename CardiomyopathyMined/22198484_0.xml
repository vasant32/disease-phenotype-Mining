<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin 1 (Hepc1) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> secreted by the liver in response to iron loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in the heart and is thought to play a role in the regulation of iron homeostasis in an autocrine and paracrine fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that expression of Hepc1 is strongly down-regulated in the heart of the cTnT(R141W) transgenic mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) at 3 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice with heart tissue-specific Hepc1 expression alone or in combination with the cTnT(R141W) mutation were produced to study the effects of Hepc1 on <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transgenic expression of Hepc1 was found to be nonlethal and resulted in decreased mortality in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, from 29.6 to 7.4%(n  = 27; P &lt; 0.05), through 7 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Hepc1 also brought about increases in the left ventricular wall, as well as ejection fraction and fractional shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of Hepc1 inhibited the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and ultra-structural alterations seen in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transgenic expression of Hepc1 restored the iron level and phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the heart tissues of cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that transgenic expression of Hepc1 compensated for the loss of Hepc1 expression and the release of iron and brought about a marked improvement in the pathologic phenotype of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, in which the ERK1/2 signal pathway might play an important role </plain></SENT>
