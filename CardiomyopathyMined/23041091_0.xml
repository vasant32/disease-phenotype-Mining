<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several pathophysiological mechanisms including reduced beta-receptor function seem involved in the autonomic and cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can be revealed by tissue Doppler imaging but is best demasked by physical or pharmacological stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liver transplantation may revert cardiac dysfunction but surgery and shunt insertion may also aggravate the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> after invasive procedures and to development of hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as part of a cardiorenal syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether beta-blockers have a deleterious effect in this clinical situation remains to be settled </plain></SENT>
