<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB8 is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> inner membrane protein with an unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that ABCB8 is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron export and is essential for baseline cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induced genetic deletion of ABCB8 in mouse hearts resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron accumulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, as assessed by echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice with ABCB8 deletion in the heart also displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage, and higher levels of reactive oxygen species and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of ABCB8 in vitro resulted in decreased iron export from isolated mitochondria, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ABCB8 is needed for the maturation of the cytosolic Fe/S proteins, as its deletion in vitro and in vivo led to decreased activity of cytosolic, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30408">iron-sulfur</z:chebi>-containing enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that ABCB8 is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function, maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron homeostasis and maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, this report provides characterization of a protein involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron export </plain></SENT>
