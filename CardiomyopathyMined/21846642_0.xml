<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The prevalence of pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (PiCMP) has been reported to be 9% 1 year after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As long-term data are sparse, the aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of PiCMP in a cohort of patients with at least 15 years of right ventricular (RV) pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were RV stimulation for at least 15 years due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> III° and absence of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> at the time of initial implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by echocardiography and spiroergometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was pre-defined as left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤45%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> during RV pacing and absence of other known causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients from our outpatient department met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed in four patients (15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed significant LV remodelling in PiCMP patients [LVEF 41.0 ± 4.5%, LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) 54.0 ± 2.7 mm] compared with patients with preserved LVEF (LVEF 61.2 ± 5.8%, P = 0.002, LVEDD 45.6 ± 4.0 mm, P= 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences regarding age, gender, duration of RV pacing, heart rate, interventricular mechanical delay, QRS duration or prevalence of sinus rhythm, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The longest intraventricular delay was significantly shorter in patients with preserved LVEF (65.5 ± 43.0 ms) compared with PiCMP patients (112.5 ± 15.0 ms, P= 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity and quality of life did not differ significantly between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the very long duration of RV stimulation in our study population (24.6 ± 6.6 years), the prevalence of PiCMP was remarkably low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was associated with more pronounced intraventricular dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
