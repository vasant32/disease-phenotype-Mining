<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to find a potential relationship between the level of PM asynchrony and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in patients with ischemic and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> (ICM and nICM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Twenty-one ICM and ten nICM patients with EF ≤ 35% and sinus rhythm were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parameters describing the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and the deformation of mitral apparatus and PM function were obtained using standard echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference of 65 ms and more in time to peak strain (ε) between anterolateral and postero-medial PM was considered indicative of PM dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PM dyssynchrony correlated with mitral tenting area and left atrial area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between nICM PM dyssynchrony and nICM LAA was stronger and far exceeded the one observed for ICM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the PM asynchrony and the remainder of the indices characterizing the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PM dyssynchrony did not reflect the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> but seems to be associated with the deformation of mitral apparatus measured by tenting area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of haemodynamic consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> can be better characterized by PM dyssynchrony in nICM than in ICM patients </plain></SENT>
