<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of cTnI at protein kinase A sites was mimicked by the S22D/S23D double mutation in cTnI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the A8V and E134D mutations had no effect on the extent of calcium desensitization of reconstituted thin filaments induced by cTnI pseudophosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the A8V mutation enhanced the effect of cTnI pseudophosphorylation on the rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments and on the calcium dependence of actomyosin ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, while the A8V mutation still led to a slower rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments upon pseudophosphorylation of cTnI, the ability of the A8V mutation to decrease the rate of calcium dissociation was weakened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ability of the A8V mutation to sensitize actomyosin ATPase to calcium was weakened after cTnI was replaced by the phosphorylation mimetic of cTnI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the hypothesis that the E134D mutation is benign, it exerted a minor to no effect on the rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments or on the calcium sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase, regardless of the cTnI phosphorylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study enhances our understanding of how <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-linked cTnC mutations affect the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon cTnI phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
