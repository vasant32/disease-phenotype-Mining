<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recognizing that inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) are increasingly employed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> and right ventricular (RV) failure, we examined PDE5 expression in the human RV and its impact on myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue extracts from the RV of 20 patients were assayed for PDE5 expression using immunoblot and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissues were selected from groups of nonfailing organ donors and transplant recipients with endstage ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients, subgroups with mild or severe RV dysfunction and prior left ventricular assist devices were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that PDE5 abundance increased more than 4-fold in the RVs of the ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> compared with the nonfailing group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, PDE5 upregulation was more moderate and varied with the severity of RV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that cardiac myocytes contributed to the upregulation in the failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In functional studies, PDE5 inhibition produced little change in developed force in RV trabeculae from nonfailing hearts but produced a moderate increase in RV trabeculae from failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the etiology- and severity-dependent upregulation of myocyte PDE5 expression in the RV and the impact of this upregulation on myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that RV PDE5 expression could contribute to the pathogenesis of RV failure, and direct myocardial responses to PDE5 inhibition may modulate the indirect responses mediated by RV afterload reduction </plain></SENT>
