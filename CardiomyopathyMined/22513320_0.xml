<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to determine whether cardiac complications are sufficiently common to warrant prospective screening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine clinical echocardiography and 3 Tesla cardiac MRI were performed on ten m.3243A&gt;G mutation carriers and compared to age and gender matched controls, with contemporaneous quadriceps muscle biopsies to measure respiratory chain activity and mtDNA mutation levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of cardiac dysfunction correlated with the percentage level of mutant mtDNA in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sub-clinical cardiac dysfunction was a universal finding in this study, adding weight to the importance of screening for cardiac complications in patients with m.3243A&gt;G </plain></SENT>
