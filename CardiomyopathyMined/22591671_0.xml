<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac transplantation is a treatment option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) who developed refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and/or intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pretransplant characteristics and post-transplant prognosis for patients with nondilated idiopathic HC has not yet fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed 813 consecutive transplant recipients undergoing cardiac transplantation at Columbia University Medical Center from 1999 to 2010 and compared the clinical course of 41 patients with idiopathic HC with that of 373 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and 398 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with HC were younger than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (47.8 ± 14.0 vs 57.1 ± 9.4 years; p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients undergoing ventricular assist devise surgery for bridge-to-transplant was lower in patients with HC than in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart disease</z:e> (14.6% vs 31.1% vs 35.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The post-transplant survival of those with HC was better than that for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (90.1% vs 85.8% and 83.9% vs 67.1% at 1 and 5 years, respectively; p = 0.0359), although it was not significantly different from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards analysis revealed that the subjects with HC had reduced post-transplant mortality (hazard ratio 0.4760, 95% confidential interval 0.1889 to 0.9762; p = 0.042) on univariate, but not multivariate, analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with HC had nondilated left ventricles (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension ≤ 55 mm; n = 27), and post-transplant survival did not differ from that for those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>dilated left ventricles</z:mp> (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension &gt;55 mm; n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the post-transplant survival of those with HC did not differ from those of the subjects who underwent transplant for other non-HC indications </plain></SENT>
