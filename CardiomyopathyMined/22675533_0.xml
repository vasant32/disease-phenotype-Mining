<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By utilizing an IAANS labeled fluorescent troponin C, [Formula: see text], we examined the effects of ten disease-related troponin modifications on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the troponin complex and the reconstituted thin filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selected modifications are associated with a broad range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>: three subtypes of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> (dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous studies, the majority of the protein modifications had no effect on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the isolated troponin complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when incorporated into the thin filament, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations desensitized (up to 3.3-fold), while hypertrophic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced truncation of troponin I, sensitized the thin filament to Ca(2+) (up to 6.3-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kinetically, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations increased the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from the thin filament (up to 2.5-fold), while the hypertrophic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced truncation of troponin I decreased the rate (up to 2-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein modifications also increased (up to 5.4-fold) or decreased (up to 2.5-fold) the apparent rate of Ca(2+) association to the thin filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the disease-related protein modifications alter Ca(2+) binding by influencing both the association and dissociation rates of thin filament Ca(2+) exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations in Ca(2+) exchange kinetics influenced the response of the thin filament to artificial Ca(2+) transients generated in a stopped-flow apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Troponin C may act as a hub, sensing physiological and pathological stimuli to modulate the Ca(2+)-binding properties of the thin filament and influence the contractile performance of the heart </plain></SENT>
