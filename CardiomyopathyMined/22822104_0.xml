<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While mitral valve surgery remains the gold standard for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), recent innovative and less invasive procedures like percutaneous MitraClip insertion make treatment options open to patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and poor left ventricular function, since such a cohort of patients invariably represents a high surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enthusiasts of this procedure advocate the use of MitraClip as a primary procedure for patients with Type 1 MR and end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Valve repair could be reserved for those patients with ongoing regurgitation following MitraClip insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient treated by MitraClip insertion in whom the unsuccessful mid-term result necessitated surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this patient, damage to the mitral valve from the MitraClip insertion produced a central leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, which precluded repair, and thereby, the patient received a mechanical valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enthusiasm for a less invasive initial approach in such patients must be balanced against the risk of failure of the primary procedure so that the patient is not denied the prospect of repair in the first instance </plain></SENT>
