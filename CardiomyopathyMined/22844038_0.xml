<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regular participation in intensive physical exercise is associated with several structural and electrophysiological cardiac adaptations that enhance diastolic filling and facilitate a sustained increase in the cardiac output that is fundamental to athletic excellence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such cardiac adaptations are collectively referred to as the '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Athlete's Heart</z:e>' and are frequently reflected on the 12-lead ECG and imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thorough knowledge relating to exercise-associated cardiovascular adaptation is imperative for the purposes of differentiating physiological adaptation from cardiac pathology, since an erroneous diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> has potentially serious consequences for the athlete's physical, psychological, social and financial well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies investigating the cardiovascular adaptation to exercise are based on cohorts of Caucasian athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is mounting evidence that ethnicity is an important determinant of the objective manifestations of cardiovascular adaptation to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most pronounced paradigm of ethnically distinct cardiovascular adaptation to exercise stems from athletes of African/Afro-Caribbean descent, who exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of repolarisation anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, compared to Caucasian athletes; the differentiation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is particularly challenging in this ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extrapolation of ECG and echocardiographic criteria used to diagnose potentially serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> in Caucasian athletes to the African/Afro-Caribbean athlete population would result in an unacceptable number of unnecessary investigations and increased risk of false disqualification from competitive sport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurate interpretation of the athlete's ECG and echocardiogram is crucial, particularly when one considers the continuous expansion of preparticipation screening programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review attempts to highlight ethnically determined differences in cardiovascular adaptation to exercise and provides a practical guide for the interpretation of baseline investigations in athletes of diverse ethnic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
