<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 1982, Goldberger described an electrocardiographic triad (SV1 or SV2 + RV5 or RV6 ≥ 3.5 mV, total QRS amplitude in each of the limb leads ≤ 0.8 mV, and R/S ratio &lt; 1 in lead V4) that was 70% sensitive and &gt; 90% specific for detecting severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm his sensitivity results, in 51 consecutive patients (36 men) aged 28 to 84 years (mean 56) with LV ejection fractions ≤ 20%, the electrocardiographic triad was sought in the electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded closest in time to the echocardiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 51 patients had systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was present in 7 and absent in 38, and in 6 patients, ischemic status was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 49 patients, New York Heart Association functional class was available: class II in 8, class III in 32, and class IV in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV ejection fractions ranged from 4% to 20% (mean 14%), and LV internal end-diastolic diameters ranged from 5.7 to 8.6 cm (mean 6.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial anteroposterior diameters ranged from 2.9 to 6.1 cm (mean 4.7) and were ≥ 4.0 cm in 47 of the 51 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right ventricular cavity was enlarged in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SV1 or SV2 + RV5 or RV6 was ≥ 3.5 mV in 29 of the 51 ECGs; total QRS amplitude was ≤ 0.8 mV in each of leads I, II, and III in 10; and the R/S ratio was &lt; 1 in lead V4 in 37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of the 51 ECGs met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Goldberger's finding of the triad to be 70% sensitive for severe LV dysfunction, in this study, the triad was found to be only 2% sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference is likely due to his patients' having idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, whereas those in this study had hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, in this study, 1 specific ECG was used for each patient, whereas Goldberger reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients' ECGs looking for the triad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Goldberger's triad is a sensitive or insensitive marker for severe LV dysfunction depending on the patient population and the number of ECGs reviewed </plain></SENT>
