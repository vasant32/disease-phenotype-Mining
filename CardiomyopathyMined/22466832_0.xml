<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous electrocardiogram revealed a bifascicular block pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because he also suffered from infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> of the native aortic valve, surgical therapy (dual-chamber permanent pacing, myectomy of the left ventricular outflow tract, and valve replacement) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> unrelated to a procedure is a rare complication in patients with HOCM, but it may be life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a pre-existing cardiac conduction disturbance should be specifically recognized as the aura of a higher degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
