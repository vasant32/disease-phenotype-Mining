<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract We report an association of ventricular non-compaction (VNC) and histiocytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both entities are rare and only two cases of their association have been reported previously in the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VNC is believed to be caused by an arrest of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endomyocardial development, resulting in a thin and compacted epicardial layer and a thickened non-compacted endocardial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HC is a rare arrhytmogenic disorder characterized by aggregates of oncocytic cells involving predominantly the subendocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells are thought to be abnormal Purkinje cells but a primitive myocardial precursor cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our case, the histiocytoid cells showed strong cytoplasmic expression for the skeletal muscle transcription factor MyoD1, which could be attributed to cross-reactivity with an undetermined cytoplasmic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, the reported cases of coexistence of these two rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> suggest a common pathogenesis rather than a casual and independent association </plain></SENT>
