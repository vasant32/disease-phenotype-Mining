<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study are to evaluate the preventive effects of North American ginseng on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to delineate the underlying mechanisms of such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Models of both type 1 (C57BL/6 mice with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (db/db mice) and age-matched and sex-matched controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alcoholic ginseng root (200 mg/kg body weight, daily oral gavage) extract was administered to groups of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice for 2 or 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysmetabolic state in the diabetic mice was significantly improved by ginseng treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the heart and retina of diabetic animals, ginseng treatment significantly prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced upregulations of extracellular matrix proteins and vasoactive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ginseng treatment in the diabetic animals resulted in enhancement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and left ventricle pressure during systole and diastole and diminution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic factor (molecular markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>) were significantly diminished in ginseng-treated diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that North American ginseng prevents the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cardiac biochemical and functional changes probably through inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
