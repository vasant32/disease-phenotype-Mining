<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to show the effect of heart transplant donor-recipient weight mismatch on mortality, right-ventricular (RV) failure, and medium-term control of systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2008 inclusive, 161 patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation at our unit were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cohort was divided into three groups of similar size depending on the tertile ranges of the donor-recipient weight ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 4.81 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor-recipient body weight ratio was analyzed with respect to intubation time, time in intensive care unit (ITU), development of RV failure, medium-term survival, and freedom from medium-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 115 months (23 days to 18 years), at a median weight of 26.9 kg (3-88 kg) at transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median donor-recipient weight ratio was 1.61 (0.62-3.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean intubation time was 448 h (SD 749.2), mean time in the ITU 302.7 h (SD 617.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On linear regression, these were not related to donor-recipient weight ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 patients (23.6%) developed postoperative RV failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-fifth (18.9) of patients in the lowest tertile group developed RV failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the middle tertile group, 24.5% developed RV failure and 28.8% in the upper tertile of weight mismatch, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On survival analysis, there was a higher mortality among those with the lowest tertile of mismatch (log-rank p = 0.04), but there was no difference in midterm survival on condition of survival to discharge (log-rank p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was also no association between weight ratio and freedom from medium-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as measured on serial 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (log-rank p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were nine patients in whom the weight mismatch was 3 or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no association between this 'extreme' mismatch group and either midterm mortality (p = 0.76) or freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.62), but this was associated with the need for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) support (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our current policy involves accepting a maximum donor-recipient weight ratio of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These encouraging findings cautiously justify this policy, in an era when marginal donors are increasingly sought </plain></SENT>
