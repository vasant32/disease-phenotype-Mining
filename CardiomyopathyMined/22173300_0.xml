<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While mutations in different myosin binding protein C (MYBPC) genes are well known causes of various human diseases, such as hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> as well as skeletal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muscular disorders</z:e>, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of MYBPC3 (cardiac isoform) mutations have been studied in great detail and several corresponding genetically altered mouse models have been generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most MYBPC3 mutations may cause haploinsufficiency and with it they may cause a primary increase in calcium sensitivity which is potentially able to explain major features observed in HCM patients such as the hypercontractile phenotype and the well known secondary effects such as myofibrillar disarray, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> and remodelling including arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However the presence of poison <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in some cases cannot be fully excluded and most probably other mechanisms are also at play </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we shall discuss MYBPC interacting proteins and possible pathways linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
