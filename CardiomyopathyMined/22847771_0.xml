<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, in the US and worldwide, poses a significant burden to patients, practitioners, and healthcare systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, there is a pressing need for alternative therapies to enhance the current treatment armamentarium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, when considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> of ischemic etiology, an intervention designed to regenerate the attending loss of myocardium could potentially result in improved cardiac function, functional status, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant strides have been made by investigators in the study of stem cell therapy for cardiac repair; recently with cardiac-derived progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells include cardiospheres, cardiosphere-derived cells, and c-kit positive cardiac stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, a review of both preclinical studies and phase I clinical trials of these cell types is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed account of in vitro characterization, in vivo bioactivity, and safety and efficacy in humans is outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus far, encouraging results have been realized, although larger studies have yet to be undertaken </plain></SENT>
