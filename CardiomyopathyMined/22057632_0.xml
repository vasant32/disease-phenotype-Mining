<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that MYBPC3 mutations are the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, accounting for about half of identified mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when compared with mutations in other myofibrillar proteins that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, MYBPC3 mutations seem to be the odd one out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most striking characteristic of HCM mutations in MYBPC3 is that many are within introns and are predicted to cause aberrant splicing leading to a frameshift and a premature chain termination, yet the truncated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> have never been identified in human heart tissue carrying these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead of expression of a poison <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> we consistently observe haploinsufficiency of MyBP-C in MYBPC3 mutant human heart muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review we investigate the mechanism for MyBP-C haploinsufficiency and consider how this haploinsufficiency could cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
