<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess left and right ventricular systolic function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3DE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients and 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left and right ventricular systolic function parameters including end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic volume (EDV), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF) were measured with RT-3DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The systolicdyssynchrony index (SDI) for left ventricular systolic function was also measured in the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study compared the data of the left and right ventricular systolic function parameters between the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMRI) was performed in a subgroup of the 30 DCM patients to confirm RT-3DE measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of EDV, ESV and SDI measured by RT-3DE were significantly higher in patient group with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> than those in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result of EF was significantly lower in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P&lt;0.001), but SV showed no significant difference between the two groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group, the results showed a significantly negative correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and SDI (r=-0.697, P&lt;0.001), and there was also a moderate correlation between LVEF and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (r=0.496, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of ESV, EDV and EF showed no significant differences as measured by RT-3DE or CMRI in the patient group (P&gt;0.05), and there was also good correlation between the two measurements (LVEF: r=0.89, P&lt;0.01; RVEF: r=0.85, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left and right ventricular systolic function in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> could be evaluated by RT-3DE with left and right ventricular systolic function parameters </plain></SENT>
