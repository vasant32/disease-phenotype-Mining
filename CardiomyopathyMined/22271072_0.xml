<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are few recent data to delineate the beyond <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>-decreased effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and the effect of different doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on endothelial-derived microparticles (EMPs) and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> might have the beyond <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>-decreased effect and there were different effects between different doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on EMPs and circulating EPCs in patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients with ICM and 100 healthy examined people, who served as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, were recruited to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 10-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group (n = 50) and 40-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were followed for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), circulating EPCs, and EMPs were examined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of adverse reactions in the 2 study groups were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the beginning of this study, there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of this study, the levels of total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, serum hsCRP, oxLDL, and circulating EMPs were significantly decreased; circulating EPCs were significantly increased in the 40-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group compared to the 10-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group, P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that receiving only 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> had a significant effect on the levels of circulating EPCs (Î² = 0.252,P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the adverse reactions between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> might decrease the levels of circulating EMPs and increase the number of circulating EPCs in patients with ICM in comparison with 10 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, and the effect might be independent of the decrease of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, oxLDL, and hsCRP </plain></SENT>
