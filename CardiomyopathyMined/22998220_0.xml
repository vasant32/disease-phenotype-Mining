<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inflammatory <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (iDCM) may be related to autoimmune processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immunoadsorption (IA) has been reported to improve cardiac hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The benefit of IA is probably related to the removal of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent study suggests additional effects of IA on the T cell-mediated immune reactions, especially on regulatory T cells (Tregs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, the correlation between the level of Tregs and improvement of myocardial contractility in response to IA in patients with iDCM was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=18) with iDCM, reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (&lt; 35%) were enrolled for IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before and 6 months after IA, LV systolic function was assessed by echocardiography, and blood levels of Tregs were quantified by FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients (n=12) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and comparable reduced LV-EF served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IA improved LV-EF in 12 of 18 patients at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients were classified as "IA Responder" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients LV EF remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At baseline, IA Responder and Non-responder subgroups showed similar values for C-reactive protein, white blood cells, lymphocytes and T helper cells, but they differ for the number of circulating Tregs (Responder: 2.32+1.38% vs. Non-Responder: 4.86+0.28%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tregs increased significantly in the IA responders, but remained unchanged in the IA non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, none of these values changed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A low level of Tregs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> iDCM may characterize a subset of patients who do best respond to IA therapy </plain></SENT>
