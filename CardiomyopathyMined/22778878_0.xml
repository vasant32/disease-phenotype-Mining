<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients (mean age 56.5 years, 10 males) who presented for evaluation of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with evidence of systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt; 40%) on echocardiography and recent ICA were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt; 1.5 g/dL, and contraindication to intravenous contrast administration were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCTA was performed using a dual source 64-slice scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean heart rate was 75 beats per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was graded for each coronary segment as: none, mild (&lt; 50%), moderate (50%-70%), severe (&gt; 70%), or non-evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) was diagnosed if severe stenosis was present in the left main, proximal left anterior descending artery, or two or more major arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients were diagnosed with ICM by ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CCTA correctly identified 2 patients with ICM and 16 patients as non-ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCTA successfully evaluated 240/246 coronary segments with an accuracy of 97.5%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 98.7%, positive predictive value of 70%, and negative predictive value of 98.7% for identifying severe stenosis on a per-segment level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dual source 64-slice multi-detector CCTA is a safe, accurate, and non-invasive technique for diagnosing ICM in patients presenting during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
