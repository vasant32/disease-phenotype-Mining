<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported our 3-step repair for obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) consisting of resection of the septum, horizontal plication of the anterior mitral leaflet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and release of abnormal papillary muscle attachments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews our complete experience with surgical management of HCM to better understand the role and relevance of mitral plication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1997 to 2011, 132 patients with HCM underwent surgical treatment at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients (62%) received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> plication based on selection criteria and were classified as group A; patients in group B did not receive plication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative and postoperative echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term clinical follow-up was obtained by review of scheduled echocardiograms and direct patient interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 55.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient decreased from 118 ± 41 mm Hg to 6 ± 13 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> improved from 2.4 ± 1.0 to 0.5 ± 0.7 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 96.2% of patients had no residual systolic anterior motion (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> classification and quality of life scores were noted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparison of groups A and B showed no statistically significant differences in outcomes, complications, or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 98%, 98%, and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the pathologic process in HCM supports detailed analysis of the septum, mitral leaflets, and subvalvular apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Surgical management of HCM that includes horizontal plication of a lax and elongated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is safe and results in durable clinical and echocardiographic improvement </plain></SENT>
