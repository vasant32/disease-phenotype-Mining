<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether prolonged exposure of cardiomyocytes to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations induces autophagy and contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there were no differences in the autophagic activation produced by different <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cell viability was decreased by high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic rats, we found a higher level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression and a reduction in the size of the left ventricle (LV) (P&lt;0.05) caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, suggesting activated autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro findings indicate that hyperglycemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induces autophagy, and our in vivo studies reveal that autophagy is involved in the progression of pathophysiological remodeling of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the studies suggest that autophagy may play a role in the pathogenesis of juvenile diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
