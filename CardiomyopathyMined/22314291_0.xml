<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their deficiencies cause the muscle vulnerable to mechanical and biochemical damages, leading to membrane leakage, dystrophic pathology, and eventual loss of muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies report that MG53, a muscle-specific TRIM-family protein, plays an essential role in sarcolemmal membrane repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that systemic delivery and muscle-specific overexpression of human MG53 gene by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors enhanced membrane repair, ameliorated pathology, and improved muscle and heart functions in δ-sarcoglycan (δ-SG)-deficient TO-2 hamsters, an animal model of MD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, MG53 overexpression increased dysferlin level and facilitated its trafficking to muscle membrane through participation of caveolin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MG53 also protected muscle cells by activating cell survival kinases, such as Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and inhibiting proapoptotic protein Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that enhancing the muscle membrane repair machinery could be a novel therapeutic approach for MD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, as demonstrated here in the limb girdle MD (LGMD) 2F model </plain></SENT>
