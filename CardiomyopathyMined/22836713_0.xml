<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, therapeutic goals for SCD prevention include identification of high risk patients and aggressively treating comorbidities underlying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many patients remain at increased risk despite optimal medical management (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) whereas others have nonmodifiable risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (eg, arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such patients, device therapy with an implantable defibrillator remains the most effective therapy for SCD prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>), which are typically implanted with at least 1 lead placed within the heart, are associated with risks related to device implantation, as well as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> endovascular leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The durability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> leads is variable and can require either new leads to be placed or require lead extraction, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recently developed subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) does not rely on any component to be placed within the heart or vasculature and therefore may mitigate the risks associated with endovascular leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be preferred for patients who are young, have inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e>, are immunocompromised, have indwelling catheters, or in whom venous access is obstructed or unfavorable due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though long-term data regarding S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> performance are not yet available it may prove to be an effective therapeutic option for prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
