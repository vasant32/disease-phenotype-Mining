<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated cardiac mechanical function in vitro and in vivo in young mice (8-10 weeks of age) carrying no functional cMyBPC alleles (cMyBPC(-/-)) or 1 functional cMyBPC allele (cMyBPC(±)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skinned myocardium isolated from cMyBPC(-/-) hearts displayed significant accelerations in stretch activation cross-bridge kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac MRI studies revealed severely depressed in vivo left ventricular (LV) magnitude and rates of LV wall strain and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous cMyBPC(±) hearts expressed 23±5% less cMyBPC than WT hearts but did not display overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skinned myocardium isolated from cMyBPC(±) hearts displayed small accelerations in the rate of stretch induced cross-bridge recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements revealed reductions in LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> and circumferential strain, as well reduced circumferential strain rates in early systole and diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modest decreases in cMyBPC expression in the mouse heart result in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> subtle changes in cross-bridge kinetics and in vivo LV mechanical function, which could contribute to the development of HCM later in life </plain></SENT>
