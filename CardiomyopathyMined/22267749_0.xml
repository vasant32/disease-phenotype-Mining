<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in a large series of families with HCM associated with MYBPC3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The initial study population comprised 57 probands with 42 mutations (26 [61.9%] novel) in MYBPC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations (15, 45.6%) were the most frequent, and multiple mutations occurred in 4 (7.0%) probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 110 mutation carriers were identified during familial evaluation; 38 were clinically affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> ≥13 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease penetrance was, therefore, incomplete (56.9% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutation carriers, 34.5% in relatives), related to age (38.4% &lt;40 versus 68.6% ≥40 years, P&lt;0.001), and was greater in males than females (65.1% versus 48.1%, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 families (25 individuals) with the R502W mutation, there was marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in age at diagnosis (5 to 80 years), pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (11 none, 9 asymmetrical, 3 concentric, 1 apical, 1 eccentric), and prognosis (premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in 2 individuals compared with survival to advanced age in 6 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow up of 7.9+/-4.5 years, in 82 clinically affected individuals the annual risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality was 0.46% and 0.93% per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disease expression in families with HCM related to MYBPC3 mutations shows marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> with incomplete, age-related, and gender specific penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, complex genetic status is observed and should be considered when mutation analysis and cascade screening is used in the evaluation of at risk family members </plain></SENT>
