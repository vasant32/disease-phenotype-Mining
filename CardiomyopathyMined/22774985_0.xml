<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated that T cells play a critical role in the development of cardiac pathology, as well as in immunoregulation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that drive protective or pathogenic T cell response are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown that CD4(+) T cells from chagasic patients preferentially express T cell receptor (TCR) β-chain variable region (Vβ) 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine whether T cells expressing this particular Vβ region displayed variable or restricted CDR3 sequences, as an indicator of the nature of the stimulus leading to the activation of these T cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we aimed to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of these cells that might be associated with pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CDR3 junctional region sequencing of Vβ5·1 expressing CD4(+) T cells revealed the occurrence of a highly homologous CDR3 region with conserved TCR Jβ region usage among patients with cardiac, but not indeterminate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, correlation analysis indicated that the frequency of CD4(+)Vβ5·1(+) cells is associated with granzyme A expression, suggesting that these cells might display cytotoxic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together these results provide new insight into T cell recognition of antigens involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> and suggest that these cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
