<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated a patient with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> using ASV and assessed the effects on hemodynamics, coronary flow, and flow reserve before and after ASV therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that ASV might decrease myocardial oxygen demand, which was represented by the decreased resting coronary flow velocity (the improvement of coronary flow velocity reserve) on ASV </plain></SENT>
