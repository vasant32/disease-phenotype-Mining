<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gap junction remodeling and down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current have been proposed as contributors to arrhythmogenesis in ARVC by slowing conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the amount of conduction slowing due to the observed gap junction remodeling and down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: The effects of (changes in) gap junctional conductance, cell dimensions, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current on both longitudinal and transversal conduction velocity were tested by simulating action potential propagation in linear strands of human ventricular cells that were either arranged end-to-end or side-by-side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: A 50% reduction in gap junction content, as commonly observed in ARVC, gives rise to an 11% decrease in longitudinal conduction velocity and a 29% decrease in transverse conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A down-regulation of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current through a 50% decrease in peak current density as well as a -15â€‰mV shift in steady-state inactivation, as observed in an experimental model of ARVC, decreases conduction velocity in either direction by 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination, the gap junction remodeling and down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current result in a 40% decrease in longitudinal conduction velocity and a 52% decrease in transverse conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The gap junction remodeling and down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current do result in conduction slowing, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of gap junction remodeling, in combination with down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, rather than gap junction remodeling per se may be a critical factor in arrhythmogenesis in ARVC </plain></SENT>
