<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite several improvements, no effective therapy has been developed and the prognosis is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the risk factors and clinical impact of EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a consecutive series of 317 HTs performed at a single institution between January 1999 and December 2008, variables associated significantly with EGF were sought in bivariate and multivariable discriminant analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deriving propensity score was used to stratify the study sample in to three groups (low, intermediate and high risk for EGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were performed between the higher-risk group and the remaining population in terms of preoperative features and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EGF occurred in 10.1% of the overall population (2.9, 3.8 and 23.6%, respectively, in the three groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, EGF-related mortality was 56.3% (100, 75 and 48%, respectively, in the three groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determinants of EGF in the highest-risk group were: redo procedure, valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, status one at transplant, recipient male sex, donor-recipient (D/R) weight mismatch, high inotropic donor support, ischaemic time and first day troponin I release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, several donor and recipient features predicted EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since such characteristics are not readily modifiable but synergistically determine the occurrence of EGF, optimization of D/R matching is crucial to prevent it </plain></SENT>
