<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of systemic HMGB1 levels in HF patients with ischemic and non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted an analysis (median follow-up time 2.5 years) of HMGB1 plasma concentration in 154 patients with systolic HF and correlated the results with disease severity and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 in HF patients with severe symptoms (NYHA III/IV; 5.35 ng/ml; interquartile range (IQR) = 3.48-8.42 ng/ml) was significantly elevated compared with that in patients with mild symptoms (NYHA I/II; 3.37 ng/ml, IQR = 2.31-5.22 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) and with controls (3.25 ng/ml, IQR = 3.04-3.67 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 levels correlated with other markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> indicating an association of HMGB1 with disease severity in HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a univariate cox regression model for the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and heart transplantation, HMGB1 proved to be a predictor at cut-off values based on HMGB1 terciles of either 3.4 or 6.1 ng/ml (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate cox regression model, which included NT-proBNP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, age, NYHA class, white blood cell count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and age, HMGB1 remained an independent predictor of the combined endpoint (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-5.83, p = 0.037 and HR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.31-4.71, p = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that HMGB1 plasma concentration is elevated in HF and correlates with disease severity and that is an independent predictor of the combined endpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and heart transplantation in HF patients </plain></SENT>
