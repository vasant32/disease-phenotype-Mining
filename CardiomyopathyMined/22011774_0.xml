<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Restrictive mitral annuloplasty (RMA) can often improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms and induce left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling in patients with non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether the observed LV reverse remodelling translates into better outcomes or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifty patients with advanced non-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (age, 64 ± 10 years, 74% men) underwent RMA and were followed up with a mean of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had 3 to 4+ functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), an ejection fraction (EF) of 26 ± 8.6 %, an indexed LV end-systolic volume (LVESVI) of 112 ± 47 ml/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received complete semi-rigid undersized ring annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between early reduction in LVESVI at 1 month after the operation and mid-term clinical outcomes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: There was no 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LVESVI significantly decreased to 96 ± 53 ml/m(2) and LVEF improved to 31 ± 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 16 (32%) recurred <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, of whom 7 (14%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve found that a reduction in LVESVI &gt;8.3% had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 78% in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With this cut-off value, there were 30 (60%) responders to reverse remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Responders had significantly better survival (96.4 versus 68.7%, P = 0.007) and freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> rate (85.4 versus 31.8%, P = 0.0003) than non-responders at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a 1-year follow-up echocardiographic study, non-responders had shown no significant LV reverse remodelling with greater degree of residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> than responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of early LV reverse remodelling is related to mid-term mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events and late reverse remodelling and repair durability after RMA for non-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
