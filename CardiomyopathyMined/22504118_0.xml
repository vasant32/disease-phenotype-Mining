<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the release kinetics of cTnT measured by fourth generation and high-sensitivity assays, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB (CK-MB), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> in patients with hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> undergoing transcoronary ablation of septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (TASH), a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients (n = 21) undergoing TASH were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and EDTA-plasma samples were collected before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 min, and 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after TASH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cTnT concentrations measured by the hs assay were significantly increased at 15 min [21.4 ng/L, interquartile range (IQR) 13.3-39.7 ng/L vs 11.3 ng/L, IQR 6.0-18.8 ng/L at baseline; P = 0.031] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison, cTnT concentrations measured by the conventional fourth generation assay increased significantly at 60 min (30.0 ng/L, IQR 20.0-30.0 ng/L vs &lt;10.0 ng/L, IQR &lt;10.0-10.0 ng/L; P &lt; 0.01), CK-MB at 90 min (8.4 μg/L, IQR 6.9-14.4 μg/L vs 0.9 μg/L, IQR 0.4-1.1 μg/L; P &lt; 0.01), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> at 30 min (188.0 μg/L, IQR 154.0-233.0 μg/L vs 38.0 μg/L, IQR 28.0-56.0; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: cTnT concentrations measured by the hs assay were significantly increased after TASH at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the time points, with a doubling at 15 min after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, confirming earlier evidence of myocardial injury compared to the fourth generation cTnT assay and CK-MB and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
