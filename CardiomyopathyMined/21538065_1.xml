<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>130 patients (mean age: 54 ± 17) presenting with troponin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and unobstructed coronary arteries were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were managed according to European Society of Cardiology guidelines, including echocardiography, and had CMR within 6.2 ± 5.3 days of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CMR provided a diagnosis in 100 of 130 patients (76.9%), with the remaining 30 (23.1%) having a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMR diagnosed 37 (28.5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, 34 (26.1%) <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, 28 (21.5%) apical ballooning syndromes and 1 (0.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When a single diagnosis was suspected by the referring physician, CMR validated this diagnosis in 32 patients (76.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMR provided a formal diagnosis in 61 patients (69.3%) in which the clinical diagnosis was uncertain between at least two possibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CMR corrected a wrong diagnosis in 10 patients (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CMR-suggested diagnosis led to a modification of therapy in 42 patients (32.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 34 months (interquartile range 24-49) in 124 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (12.9%) experienced MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MACE rate was not different between patients with a conclusive CMR and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> troponin-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and unobstructed coronary arteries, early CMR has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However its association with occurrence of MACE during mid term follow-up was not obvious </plain></SENT>
