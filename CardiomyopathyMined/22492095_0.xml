<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate directly recorded efferent sympathetic nerve traffic in patients with stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (SIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SIC is a syndrome affecting mostly postmenopausal women following severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though the precise pathophysiology is not well understood, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> overstimulation of the myocardium is thought to underlie the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct recordings of multiunit efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were obtained from 12 female patients, 5 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (24-48 h) and 7 in the recovery phase (1-6 months), with apical ballooning pattern and 12 healthy matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSNA was expressed as burst frequency (BF), burst incidence (BI) and relative median burst amplitude (RMBA %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the twelve patients in this study was on beta blockade treatment due to a different illness, at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were investigated with ongoing medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MSNA was lower in patients with SIC as compared to matched controls, but did not differ between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and recovery phase of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RMBA %, blood pressure and heart rate did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MSNA is shown to be lower in patients with SIC compared to healthy controls, suggesting that sympathetic neuronal outflow is rapidly reduced following the initial phase of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A distension of the ventricular myocardium, due to excessive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release over the heart in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, may increase the firing rate of unmyelinated cardiac c-fibre afferents resulting in widespread sympathetic inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism may underlie the lower MSNA reported in our patients </plain></SENT>
