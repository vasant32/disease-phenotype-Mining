<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the proportion and long-term outcomes of patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and potential indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator before and after optimization of medical treatment, 503 consecutive patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were evaluated from 1988 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 245 patients (49%) satisfied the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden Cardiac Death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Trial (SCD-HeFT) criteria," defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤0.35 and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III on registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these, 162 (group A) were re-evaluated 5.4 ± 2 months later with concurrent β-blockers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 162 patients, 50 (31%) still had "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group A1), 109 (67%) had an improved left ventricular ejection fraction and/or New York Heart Association class (group A2), and 3 (2%) were in NYHA class IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 227 patients without baseline "SCD-HeFT criteria" (left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;0.35 or NYHA class I), 125 were evaluated after 5.5 ± 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 227 patients, 13 (10%) developed "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group B1), 111 (89%) remained without "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group B2), and 1 (1%) had worsened to NYHA class IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 10-year mortality/heart transplantation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>/sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> rate was 57% and 37% in group A1, 23% and 20% in group A2 (p &lt;0.001 for mortality/heart transplantation and p = 0.014 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>/sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> vs group A1), 45% and 41% in group B1 (p = NS vs group A1), 16% and 14% in group B2 (p = NS vs group A2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, two thirds of patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and "SCD-HeFT criteria" at presentation did not maintain implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications 3 to 9 months later with optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their long-term outcome was excellent, similar to that observed for patients who had never met the "SCD-HeFT criteria." </plain></SENT>
