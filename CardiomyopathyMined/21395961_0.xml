<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TC) is increasingly recognised in patients presenting with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a single centre experience of TC with medium term follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients presenting with a diagnosis of TC were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, complications, baseline and follow-up echocardiograms and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stressful event preceded presentation in 37 (71%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>Chest pain</z:hpo> was the most common symptom (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with an out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ST segment elevation (40%) and global T wave inversion (44%) were the most frequent electrocardiogram changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular assessment demonstrated typical apical ballooning in 41 patients and 11 patients demonstrated the mid-wall variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications occurred in 11 patients (21%) and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (n = 2), cardiogenic shock (n = 5); two of whom had a significant left ventricular outflow gradient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0587044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular thrombus</z:e> (n = 2) and a cerebrovascular event (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular function at presentation and follow up was compared in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean ejection fraction in this group at presentation was 47% (20-70%) compared with that at follow up of 63% (44-76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant complications or recurrences at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While TC is a reversible condition with low rates of complications and recurrence at follow up it is, as demonstrated in our cohort, associated with significant in-hospital morbidity in a proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
