<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous structural studies indicated a special functional role for an acidic region composed of residues 1-10 in the unique N-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Employing LC-MS/MS, we determined the presence of phosphorylation sites at S5/S6 in cTnI from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mouse hearts as well as in hearts of mice chronically expressing active protein kinase C-ε (PKCε) and exhibiting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the functional significance of these phosphorylations, we cloned and expressed <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cTnI, (Wt), and cTnI variants expressing pseudo-phosphorylation cTnI-(S5D), cTnI(S6D), as well as cTnI(S5A) and cTnI(S6A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We exchanged native Tn of detergent-extracted (skinned) fiber bundles with Tn reconstituted with the variant cTnIs and measured tension and cross-bridge dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, myofilaments controlled by cTnI with pseudo-phosphorylation (S6D) or Ala substitution (S6A) demonstrated a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in maximum tension, ATPase rate, and k(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>), but no change in half-maximally activating Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, pseudo-phosphorylation at position 5 (S5D) had no effects, although S5A induced an increase in Ca(2+)-sensitivity with no change in maximum tension or k(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further tested the impact of acidic domain modifications on myofilament function in studies examining the effects of cTnI(A2V), a mutation linked to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mutation significantly altered the inhibitory activity of cTnI as well as cooperativity of activation of myofilament tension, but not when S23/S24 were pseudo-phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate a new functional and pathological role of amino acid modifications in the N-terminal acidic domain of cTnI that is modified by phosphorylations at cTnI(S23/S24) </plain></SENT>
