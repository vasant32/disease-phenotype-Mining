<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the most common etiologies of this phenotypically diverse disease lie in a handful of genes encoding critical contractile myofilament proteins, approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with HCM worldwide do not host sarcomeric gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in genes encoding calcium-sensitive and calcium-handling proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these are mutations in TNNC1- encoded cardiac troponin C, PLN-encoded phospholamban, and JPH2-encoded junctophilin 2 which have each been associated with HCM in multiple studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in RYR2-encoded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2, CASQ2-encoded calsequestrin 2, CALR3-encoded calreticulin 3, and SRI-encoded sorcin have been associated with HCM, although more studies are required to validate initial findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While a relatively uncommon cause of HCM, mutations in genes that encode calcium-handling proteins represent an emerging genetic subset of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these naturally occurring disease-associated mutations have provided useful molecular tools for uncovering novel mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, increasing our understanding of basic cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, and dissecting important structure-function relationships within these proteins </plain></SENT>
