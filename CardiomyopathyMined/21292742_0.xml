<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prevalence, pattern and predictors of HIV-related cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre-diagnosed HIV-infected children aged 18 months to 12 years from a tertiary teaching hospital in Lagos, South-West Nigeria were enrolled in a comparative, observational cross-sectional study; matched with apparently healthy controls of the same age group, were recruited sequentially between May 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportions of pre-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> diagnosed by clinical examination and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> in HIV-infected children was 75.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (33.7%), decreased LVSF of ≤ 25% in 33.7%, increased left ventricular mass (20.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (14.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Structural and functional abnormalities are prevalent in HIV-infected African children and therefore justify inclusion of routine echocardiography in their standard care </plain></SENT>
