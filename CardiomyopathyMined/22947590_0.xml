<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is noted in up to 40% of infants of diabetic mothers, and the exact mechanisms responsible for it are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare between infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) and infants of non- diabetic mothers (INDM) as regards cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels (as a marker of cardiac dysfunction) and to examine the relationship between this marker and neonatal echocardiographic changes (cardiac structure and function) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, comparative study included eighty full term neonates during the first three days of life, during the period from April 2008 to June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups, group I: included 40 infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs)and group II: included 40 infants of non diabetic healthy mothers as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 37.5% of the IDMs were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> and demonstrated a significantly lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level than the control group (34.6 +/- 11.3mg/dl Vs 77.2 +/- 19.8 mg/dl respectively) , <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> were the presenting signs in 67.5% of IDMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac TnI on the second day of life increased significantly in infants of diabetic mothers in comparison to INDM (p &lt; 0.006)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IDMs had a significant increase in left atrial thickness ( 11.5 +/- 1.8mm in IDM Vs 10.5 +/- 0.9mm in INDM P &lt; 0.002*) and a significant increase in septal thickness (5.0 +/- 1.2mm in IDM Vs 4.0 +/- 0.5mm in INDM P &lt; 0.001*) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTnI correlated positively with interventricular septum thickness (P-value = 0.002*) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac TnI was significantly increased in IDMs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> (P -value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a highly significant positive correlation between cTnI level on the second day of life and the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVED) and interventricular septum diameter (IVSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a useful biochemical marker for monitoring myocardial injury in infants of diabetic mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An elevated cTnI concentration in infants of diabetic mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> was a good predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and/or left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
