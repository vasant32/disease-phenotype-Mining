<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many patients have contraindications to ceMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that contrast enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (ceMDCT) can visualize focal scars following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in experimental animals and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this manuscript is to assess the ability of ceMDCT to detect focal myocardial scars in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve HCM patients underwent ceMRI and ceMDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrotic areas of myocardium were defined as focal or diffuse areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean signal intensity in ceMRI and attenuation values in ceMDCT of the fibrotic regions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardium and left ventricle blood pool contrast were measured using qualitative and quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal scar mass was calculated using both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Focal scars were detected in 9 patients and diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by ceMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between normalized SI of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardium and focal scars, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diffuse areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and focal scars were significant for both ceMRI and ceMDCT (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was poorly visualized by ceMDCT but was detectable using quantitative measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CeMDCT has potential to detect focal myocardial scars in patients with HCM who have contraindications to ceMRI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, ceMDCT does not enable adequate visualization of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, and thus is less well suited than ceMRI for assessment of total burden of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This limitation may be overcome using quantitative methodology </plain></SENT>
