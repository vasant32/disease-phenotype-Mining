<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The value of assessment of viability as a predictor of surgical revascularization benefit in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has recently been questioned in a large trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the contribution of viability as myocardial scar burden (SB) to predict revascularization outcomes could be modulated by end-systolic volume index (ESVi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Delayed hyperenhancement-MRI was obtained in 450 patients with ≥70% stenosis in ≥1 epicardial coronary artery (75% men; median age, 62.8±10.7 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction, 23±9%; mean ESVi, 115±50 mL) from 2002 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SB was quantified as scar percentage (infarcted mass/total left ventricular mass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent surgical revascularization was performed in 245 (54%) patients and subsequent percutaneous coronary interventions were performed in 28 (6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A propensity score was developed for revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were used for risk adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 5.8±2.7 years, 186 (41%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for prior revascularization, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, age, use of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, and mitral valve procedures; an interaction between scar percentage and ESVi (P=0.016) and an interaction between post-MRI revascularization and ESVi (P=0.0017) were independently associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ESVi demonstrated a significant interaction with revascularization and female sex, such that enhanced survival was associated with ESVi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ESVi also showed an interaction with SB; better survival was associated with lower volumes and less scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ESVi and SB provide independent, incremental prognostic value in patients with severe ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk associated with SB should not be assessed in isolation </plain></SENT>
