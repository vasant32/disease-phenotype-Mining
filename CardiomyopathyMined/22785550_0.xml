<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although small experiences have been described with the use of apico-aortic valved conduit in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), the long-term follow-up has never been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a young female patient with symptomatic HCM and a prognostically unfavorable phenotype, apico-aortic conduit was chosen instead of conventional myectomy because severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> involved the whole ventricle, making outflow tract cavity virtually absent in systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Close clinical and imaging follow-up was postoperatively performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient remained asymptomatic, without cardioactive drug therapy for 30 years, also experiencing 2 successful pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A striking finding was the perfect patency of the conduit at the last follow-up control (31 years), with computed tomography and echocardiography showing no calcification of the porcine Hancock bioprosthesis inside the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the disease slowly evolved towards the dilative phase and the patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> while scheduled for implantation of defibrillator in waiting list for heart transplant.The present case could suggest that, in selected cases of HCM not treatable by myectomy, apico-aortic conduit may be an option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relief of the obstruction can provide even long-term freedom from symptoms, however, late evolution to end-stage cannot be prevented </plain></SENT>
