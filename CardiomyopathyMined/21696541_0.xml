<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined the effects of MLCK-phosphorylation of transgenic (Tg) mouse cardiac muscle preparations expressing the D166V (aspartic acid to valine)-RLC mutation, identified to cause familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with malignant outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous work with Tg-D166V mice demonstrated a large increase in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction, reduced maximal ATPase and force and a decreased level of endogenous RLC phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on studies demonstrating the beneficial and/or protective effects of cardiac myosin phosphorylation for heart function, we hypothesized that an ex vivo phosphorylation of Tg-D166V cardiac muscle may rescue the detrimental contractile phenotypes observed earlier at the level of single myosin molecules and in Tg-D166V papillary muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We showed that MLCK-induced phosphorylation of Tg-D166V cardiac myofibrils and muscle fibres was able to increase the reduced myofibrillar ATPase and reverse an abnormally increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force to the level observed for Tg-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to Tg-WT, which displayed a phosphorylation-induced increase in steady-state force, the maximal tension in Tg-D166V papillary muscle fibres decreased upon phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the exception of force generation data, our results support the notion that RLC phosphorylation works as a rescue mechanism alleviating detrimental functional effects of a disease causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this unexpected phosphorylation-induced decrease in maximal tension in Tg-D166V-skinned muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
