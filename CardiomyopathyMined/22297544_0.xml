<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the past few years, a novel syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction precipitated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> emotional or physical stress has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While patients with "stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>"(SCM) typically present with signs and symptoms that resemble an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, it has become clear that this syndrome has unique clinical features that can readily be distinguished from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction.In particular, in contrast to the irreversible myocardial injury seen with infarction, the myocardial dysfunction of SCM is completely reversible and occurs in the absence of plaque rupture and coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that exaggerated sympathetic stimulation may play a pathogenic role in the development of SCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels have been found to be markedly elevated in some patients with SCM, and the syndrome has been observed in other clinical states of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> excess such as central neurologic injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo>.Further, intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> can precipitate SCM in humans and can reproduce the syndrome in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism in which excessive sympathetic stimulation may result in transient left ventricular dysfunction remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal myocardial blood flow due to sympathetically mediated microvascular dysfunction has been suggested and is supported by decreased coronary flow reserve during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation is the direct effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> on cardiac myocytes, possibly through cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-mediated calcium overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This manuscript will review the clinical and diagnostic features of SCM and will summarize the evidence supporting a sympathetically mediated pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical risk factors that appear to increase susceptibility to SCM, possibly by modulating myocyte and microvascular sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, will also be highlighted </plain></SENT>
