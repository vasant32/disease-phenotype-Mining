<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Autoantibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that autoantibodies are present in patients with postural orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome (POTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seven control subjects (6 F:1 M, average age 36.1 years) and 10 patients with the diagnosis of POTS (7 F: 3 M, average age 35.1 years) provided informed consent and 30 ml of venous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human heart membrane proteins were resolved by 2DE and immunoblotted against purified IgGs from controls and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen protein spots immunoreactive specifically against patient IgGs were detected and they were excised from gels, trypsin-digested, and analyzed by nanoLC-electrospray tandem MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty unique proteins were identified and these include proteins that are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> (mimecan, myozenin), cardiac remodeling (periostin), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (desmin, desmoplakin), cell survival (laminin), structural integrity (filamin), chaperone proteins (crystalline, HSP70), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzymes and channel proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed multiple pathways were involved including those that regulate energy metabolism, redox, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Autoantibodies are present in patients with POTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These autoantibodies cross-react with a wide range of cardiac proteins and may induce alterations in cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune pathogenetic mechanisms should be further explored in these patients </plain></SENT>
