<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 57-year-old man with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, New York Heart Association Class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and an ejection fraction of 15%, underwent an attempted cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardiac defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the coronary sinus ostium could not be cannulated, a dual chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently underwent cardiovascular CT angiography, which identified a prominent Thebesian valve at the coronary sinus ostium as the anatomic obstacle to cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reattempted transvenous cardiac resynchronization therapy was accomplished successfully with a double cannulation approach: cannulation of the coronary sinus ostium with a catheter via a transvenous femoral vein approach and subsequent cannulation with the coronary venous lead via a left subclavian approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a prominent Thebesian valve is identified as an obstacle to transvenous left ventricular lead placement, cannulation of the coronary sinus by an alternate venous approach may allow for a coronary venous route rather than necessitate an epicardial approach </plain></SENT>
