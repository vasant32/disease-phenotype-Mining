<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DCP) is one of the leading causes of increased morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neuregulin-1(NRG1)/ErbB signal system plays a critical role in maintenance of adult heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But little is known about the changes of NRG1/ErbB signal system in DCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of the NRG1/ErbB signal system in DCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of DCP was established using a single intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left ventricle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was evaluated using Masson's trichrome staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles of ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of NRG1 and the phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors were assessed using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed dramatic left ventricle <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and impaired left ventricle systolic function at 12 weeks after STZ-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study also showed that ErbB2 andErbB4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and NRG1 protein expression in the left ventricular myocardium were significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, weobserved decreased phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors at 12 weeks after the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that NRG1/ErbB signaling is impaired in DCP, which may play some roles in the pathogenesis of DCP </plain></SENT>
