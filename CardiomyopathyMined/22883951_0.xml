<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2003 to March 2011, 38 patients (26 male and 12 female) with HOCM underwent modified Morrow procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 36.3 years (ranging from 18 to 64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by echocardiography and spiral CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean systolic gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta from transthroax echocardiography (TTE) was (89±31) mmHg (ranging from 50 to 184 mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was moderate or severe systolic anterior motion (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) in 38 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 29 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular septal myectomy with modified Morrow procedure was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 38 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TEE was used intraoperatively to evaluate the results of the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 to 2 weeks of operation, TTE was performed to evaluate the effect of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up with TTE after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were discharged without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative TEE showed that the mean systolic gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta was decreased from (95±36) mmHg before procedures to (14±11) mmHg after operation (t=13.265, P=0.000), and the thickness of ventricular septum was decreased from (28±8) mm to (12±3) mm (t=11.656, P=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TTE showed that the mean systolic gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta was decreased from (89±31) mmHg preoperatively to (18±13) mmHg (t=12.729, P=0.000) in 1 to 2 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> were significantly improved or disappeared (t=7.930, t=5.213, both P=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients promptly became completely asymptomatic or complained of mild effort <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> only and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> was abolished, and TTE showed that the pressure gradient was kept on the postoprational level or slightly decreased (P=0.494) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular septal myectomy with modified Morrow procedure is a mostly effective method for patients with HOCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Good surgical exposure and the hypertrophied septum thoroughly excised are paramount for successful surgery </plain></SENT>
