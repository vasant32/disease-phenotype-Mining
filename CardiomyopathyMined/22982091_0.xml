<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Disturbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, particularly in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>), may result in advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the possible targets for this reaction is lipofuscin (LF), an intracytoplasmic garbage presumed to be a marker of physiologic and preterm aging of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed to seek for a relationship between AGE and LF in cardiocytes of the failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Archived tissue samples from 136 hearts explanted before transplantation (in 14 pts. with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>; 8 pts. with dilated CM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>; 67 non-diabetic pts. with ischemic CM; 47 non-diabetic pts. with dilated CM), 14 autopsy cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, and 20 heart donors (control group) were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical localization of AGE was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of lipofuscin and AGE was studied by LF autofluorescence in AGE-positive slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LF granules inside AGE deposits were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied groups with varying frequencies, but the differences were non-significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LF granules joined significantly with dispersed patterns of AGE i.e. diffuse and mixed, whereas coincidence of LF and AGE forming granular pattern was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that LF may belong to the components of the AGE deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this phenomenon is dependent on the AGE dispersion grade, but neither on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> presence </plain></SENT>
