<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> are at increased risk of cardiovascular events, resulting in a higher incidence of cardiac complications following liver transplantation (OLT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical value of computed tomographic coronary arteriography (CTCAG) as a routine preoperative cardiac evaluation test in adult patients scheduled for living donor OLT (LDLT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This single-center, prospective, observational study evaluated 247 adult patients being assessed for LDLT from April 2010 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTCAG was performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-negative findings on routine cardiac workup, including <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 247 patients evaluated, 27 (10.9%) showed abnormal findings on CTCAG, with 18 (7.3%) showing mild to moderate involvement of one vessel; 7 (2.8%), two-vessel; and 2 (0.8%), three-vessel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>Coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> was identified in patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No adverse events occurred after CTCAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noticeable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> during LDLT surgery occurred in 5% of patients, mostly related to massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postperfusion syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first 3 months after LDLT, 3% of patients showed stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recovered with supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The poor general medical condition of LDLT candidates and the diagnostic accuracy of CTCAG suggest that this test should be included in the routine pretransplant cardiac workup, along with <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> SPECT, for these patients </plain></SENT>
