<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results identified that the post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> rats suffered from elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adverse cardiac remodelling in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, whereas the rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> have been protected from these changes as evidenced by the decreased myocardial levels of ER stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> markers when compared with the vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the myocardial dimensions and cardiac function were preserved significantly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>-treated rats in comparison with the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> rats treated with vehicle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> showed significant suppression of the myocardial endothelin-1 and also the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinases (MAPK) suggesting that the protection offered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> treatment against progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> involves the modulation of MAPK signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the present study provides data to support the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> in protecting the hearts of the rats with post <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
