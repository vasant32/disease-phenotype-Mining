<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We determined the relationship between fragmented QRS (<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>) on electrocardiograms (ECG) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> measured by delayed enhancement of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DE-CMR) and its prognostic implication in patients with non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ECGs of 86 subjects with dilated non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> who underwent DE-CMR were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension &gt;55mm with LVEF &lt;45% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> for ≥9months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac events (re-hospitalization due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, arrhythmic event, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> was defined by the presence of an additional R wave (R″), or notching of the S wave, or the presence of more than one R prime in two contiguous leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 86 patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> developed in 53 patients (61.6%) and delayed enhancement was observed in 42 patients (48.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean ejection fraction was 25.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses of echocardiographic parameters revealed left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were significantly higher in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group, but that the left ventricular ejection fraction was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of delayed enhancement between two groups was not significantly different (50.9% in <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> vs. 45.5% in the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group; p=0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MACE-free survival was significantly decreased in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group compared with the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no spatial relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> and DE-CMR in patients with non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> was associated with lower event-free survival for major cardiac events on long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
