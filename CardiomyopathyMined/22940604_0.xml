<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is a major contributing factor for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and multiple mechanisms have been proposed for its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that following <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an increased nuclear presence of the Forkhead transcription factor, FoxO1, could turn on cardiac cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through mediation of nitrosative stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">Streptozotocin</z:chebi> (100mg/kg) was used to induce irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in Wistar rats, and heart tissues and blood samples extracted starting from 1 to 4days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">Diazoxide</z:chebi> (100mg/kg), which produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, were followed for up to 12h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, attenuation of survival signals was accompanied by increased nuclear FoxO1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in iNOS expression and iNOS induced protein nitrosylation of GAPDH, increased GAPDH binding to Siah1 and facilitated nuclear translocation of the complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though caspase-3 was cleaved during <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, its nitrosylation modification affected its ability to inactivate PARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, there was PARP activation followed by nuclear compartmentalization of AIF, and increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine externalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests a role for FoxO1 mediated iNOS induced S-nitrosylation of target proteins like GAPDH and caspase-3 in initiating cardiac cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and could explain the impact of glycemic control in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
