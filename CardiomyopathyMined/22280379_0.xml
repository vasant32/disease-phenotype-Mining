<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the pacemaker funny current (I(f)) inhibitor ivabradine on heart rate (HR), left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, and left atrial performance in healthy cats and cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: 6 healthy cats and 6 cats with subclinical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Anesthetized cats underwent cardiac catheterization and were studied over a range of hemodynamic states induced by treatment with esmolol (200 to 400 μg/kg/min, IV), esmolol and dobutamine (5 μg/kg/min, IV), ivabradine (0.3 mg/kg, IV), and ivabradine and dobutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, cardiac output, and left atrial function were studied via catheter-based methods and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant reduction of HR, rate-pressure product, and LV contractile function and a significant increase in LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic wall stress, and LV relaxation time constant (tau) in cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent administration of ivabradine and dobutamine resulted in a significant increase of LV contractility and lusitropy, with blunted chronotropic effects of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial performance was not significantly altered by ivabradine in cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed an association between maximum rate of LV pressure rise and tau in cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ivabradine had significant effects on several cardiovascular variables in anesthetized cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies in awake cats with HCM are needed to clinically validate these findings </plain></SENT>
