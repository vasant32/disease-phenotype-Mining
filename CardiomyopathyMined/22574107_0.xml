<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize the cardiac phenotype of male knock-out mice that are deficient in alpha-galactosidase A activity, as a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> and test the efficacy of Enzyme Replacement Therapy with agalsidase-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male mice (3-4 months of age) were characterized with awake blood pressure and heart rate measurements, cardiac echocardiography and electrocardiography measurements under light anesthesia, histological studies and molecular studies with real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Fabry knock-out mouse has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and lower blood pressure than control <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (CB7BL/6J) mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ascending aorta <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies were consistent with early stages of cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single dose of agalsidase-beta (3 mg/kg) did not affect the LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, function or heart rate, but did improve the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> signals of early cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the alpha-galactosidase A deficient mice at 3 to 4 months of age have cardiac and vascular alterations similar to that described in early clinical stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
