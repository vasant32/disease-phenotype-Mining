<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In recent years, the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> in pathophysiology of the heart attracted much attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">Ceramide</z:chebi> was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and lipotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine-1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S1P), has been shown to possess potent cardioprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine plasma concentrations of major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects were divided into two major groups: 1) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systolic HF (n=47), and 2) healthy age-matched controls (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the former group were further divided according to the underlying cause of HF (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, n=29 and 18, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of S1P, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16893">sphinganine-1-phosphate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> observed in both groups of HF patients were very close to these noted in the healthy controls, and no statistically significant differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the level of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16566">sphinganine</z:chebi> in the plasma of patients with HF decreased by 25 and 27%, respectively, as compared to the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was independent from the underlying cause of HF as the mean concentrations of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35785">sphingoid bases</z:chebi> in patients with ischemic and idiopathic HF were virtually the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is associated with decreased concentration of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35785">sphingoid bases</z:chebi> in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, despite lower availability of substrates required for synthesis of cardioprotective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35785">sphingoid base</z:chebi>-1 phosphates, their plasma level remains stable </plain></SENT>
