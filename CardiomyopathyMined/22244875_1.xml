<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigate for the first time the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) on nucleolar organization and proteins in patients with ischemic (ICM) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 71 human hearts from ICM (n=38) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n=27) patients, undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (n=6), were analysed by western-blotting, RT-PCR and cell biology methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When we compared protein levels according to HF etiology, nucleolin was increased in both ICM (117%, p&lt;0.05) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (141%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were also upregulated in ICM (1.46-fold, p&lt;0.05) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (1.70-fold, p&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies showed that the highest intensity of nucleolin was into nucleolus (p&lt;0.0001), and it was increased in pathological hearts (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructure analysis by electron microscopy showed an increase in the nucleus and nucleolus size in ICM (17%, p&lt;0.05 and 131%, p&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (56%, p&lt;0.01 and 69%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nucleolar organization was influenced by HF irrespective of etiology, increasing fibrillar centers (p&lt;0.001), perinucleolar chromatin (p&lt;0.01) and dense fibrillar components (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, left ventricular function parameters were related with nucleolin levels in ischemic hearts (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that HF influences on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and organization of nucleolar components, revealing changes in the expression and in the levels of nucleolin protein </plain></SENT>
