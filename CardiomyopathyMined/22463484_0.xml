<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in pregnant South Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We systematically reviewed the contemporary epidemiology and peripartum outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in South African women attending antenatal care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Searches were performed in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the EBSCO Africa-Wide database, the South African Union Catalogue, and the Current and Completed Research database (South Africa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>References of included articles were also hand-searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies reporting epidemiologic data on antenatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in South Africa were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on morbidity and mortality were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> ranged from 123 to 943 per 100,000 deliveries, with a median prevalence of 616 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rheumatic valvular lesions were the commonest abnormalities, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> were disproportionately high in comparison with other developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripartum case-fatality rates were as high as 9.5 per cent in areas with limited access to care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent complications were pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perinatal mortality ranged from 8.9 to 23.8 per cent, whilst mitral lesions were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis could not be performed due to clinical and statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately 0.6 per cent of pregnant South Africans have pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, with rheumatic lesions being the commonest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality continue to be very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We conclude this review by summarising limitations of the current literature and recommending standard reporting criteria for future reports </plain></SENT>
