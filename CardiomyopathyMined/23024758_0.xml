<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined the miRNA expression levels of early- and end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) in a severe, transgenic mouse model of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five miRNAs were differentially expressed at an early stage of HCM development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time-course analysis revealed that decreased expression of miR-1 and miR-133a commences at a pre-disease stage, and precedes upregulation of target genes causal of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and extracellular matrix remodelling, suggesting a role for miR-1 and miR-133a in early disease development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At end-stage HCM, 16 miRNA are dysregulated to form an expression profile resembling that of other forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, suggesting common responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcriptome revealed that miRNAs potentially target 15.7% upregulated and 4.8% downregulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> at end-stage HCM, and regulate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and electrophysiology, calcium signalling, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and the TGF-Î² signalling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results define the miRNA expression signatures during development and progression of severe HCM and highlight critical miRNA regulated gene networks that are involved in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
