<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic services commenced in the cardiac unit of the University of Port-Harcourt teaching hospital in southern Nigeria in April 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to report our experience with the procedure over a 12 month period as well as the spectrum of clinical cases diagnosed at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out at the cardiology unit of the department of internal medicine of the University of Port-Harcourt teaching hospital in southern Nigeria between May 2009 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was performed with the ALOKA- 400R machine using two dimensional, M-mode, color flow and tissue Doppler protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients, 119 males and 115 females, were examined during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 10 to 96 years with a mean of 49.69 +/- 16.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-four patients (53%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e>, 20 (9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> while 13 (6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001648'>cor pulmonale</z:hpo>, arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, prosthetic heart valve, aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were present in less than 5% of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The echocardiography was inconclusive in 3 (1%) while 49 (21%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypertensive heart disease</z:e> was the largest echocardiographic diagnosis at our center and is one of the most important noncommunicable diseases responsible for increased morbidity and mortality among our patients in Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More work needs to be done to increase awareness about, and treatement for, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in order to prevent its complications </plain></SENT>
