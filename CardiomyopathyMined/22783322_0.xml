<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One type, often called tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC), is typically triggered by significant emotional or physical stress and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and abnormal cardiac enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities usually include an akinetic "ballooning" apex with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or hyperdynamic function of the base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second type, often called neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e>, typically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, also usually presents with ECG changes and positive enzymes, but the typical wall motion abnormalities seen include <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basal and apical left ventricular contraction with akinesis of the mid-cavity in a circumferential fashion </plain></SENT>
