<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Isolated left ventricular noncompaction (ILVNC) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by intrauterine failure of the myocardium to compact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common clinical complications are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A paucity of data exists relating to clinical and echocardiographic features of ILVNC in Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is a single-center, prospective case-control study, whereby subjects attending a dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> clinic were screened for and diagnosed with ILVNC, provided they had no other associated structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the accompanying echocardiographic criteria: (1) end-systolic ratio of noncompacted layer to compacted layer &gt;2, (2) presence of &gt;3 prominent apical trabeculations, and (3) deep intertrabecular recesses that fill with blood from the ventricular cavity visualized using color Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four subjects were identified, age 45.4±13.1 years (mean±SD), 95% confidence interval 3.6 to 10.2, 55.6% male, and 63.0% New York Health Association Class II, and prevalence of LVNC in our clinic was 6.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.6 to 10.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> because of systolic dysfunction was the most common clinical presentation (53 subjects, 98.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 61.4±7.2 mm (mean±SD) and ejection fraction 26.7±11.9% (mean±SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common sites of noncompaction were the apical (100%), midinferior (74.1%), and midlateral (64.8%) walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular noncompaction occurred in 12 subjects (22.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>Pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> was documented in 45 cases (83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002754'>Right ventricular dilation</z:mp> was noted in 40 subjects (74.1%), while right ventricular function was depressed in 32 (59.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tricuspid S' was 9.6±2.8 cm/s (mean±SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No echocardiographic features suggestive of ILVNC were noted in a healthy control group of African descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ILVNC in patients of African descent can be characterized by biventricular abnormality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, in addition to isolated left-sided abnormality </plain></SENT>
