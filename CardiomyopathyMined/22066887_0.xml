<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is still some debate regarding the prognostic significance of left ventricular longitudinal systolic dysfunction as assessed by tissue Doppler (TD) imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), since previous studies have included patients with postischemic wall motion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study was designed to ascertain whether TD-derived longitudinal systolic dysfunction may influence the outcome of patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 200 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, peak systolic mitral annular velocity (S(m) ) was measured by pulsed TD at the septal and lateral annular sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end points were cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospitalization for worsening HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up duration was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a time independent analysis, averaged S(m) calculated as the average of septal and lateral S(m) , resulted to be a significant predictor of outcome in the study population (area under receiver-operator characteristic curve: cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 0.69, P &lt; 0.0001; cardiovascular events, 0.64, P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a time-dependent analysis, average S(m) was associated with both cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 0.832, P = 0.0019) and cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.904, P = 0.039), independently of other clinical risk factors and echocardiographic parameters of systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Septal S(m) but not lateral S(m) was independently associated with the outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the assessment of systolic mitral annular velocity by pulsed TD is a useful indicator for prognostic stratification of patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF </plain></SENT>
