<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of mitral isthmus VT was made from electrophysiological observations, including electro-anatomical activation and voltage map, pace-mapping, entrainment mapping and ablation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On autopsy of the heart, sarcoidic lesion with scattered fibrous tissue in the mitral isthmus was non-transmural, and the surviving myocardium serving as the reentry circuit in the endomyocardium was isolated from the adjacent viable epimyocardium, enabling the sustenance of macroreentry across the mitral isthmus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-transmural lesions produced by RF delivery created a barrier sufficient to interrupt the myocardial bundles located in the mitral isthmus, eliminating the mitral isthmus VT </plain></SENT>
