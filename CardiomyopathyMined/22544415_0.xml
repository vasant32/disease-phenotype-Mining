<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>Dyspnea</z:hpo> and the resulting functional impairment are a common complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between physician-perceived functional status, patient-perceived health status, and objective exercise test results has not been evaluated in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the correlation between the Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire (KCCQ) and (1) physician's perceived (NYHA class) and (2) objective measurement (cardiopulmonary exercise test) of functional capacity in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 outpatients with HCM at a single, referral center, the KCCQ instrument was administered and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of symptoms as determined by physician (NYHA classification) and patient (KCCQ instrument) was obtained before exercise test results were known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation was used to assess the independent correlation between KCCQ score and the various exercise parameters; Spearman correlation was used to assess correlation between KCCQ score and NYHA class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KCCQ results demonstrated moderate reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains, with greatest reduction in quality-of-life domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPX testing showed reduction in peak oxygen consumption (mean absolute <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> 20.5 ± 7.8 ml/kg/min and percent predicted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> 76.8 ± 4.1 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were negative correlations between NYHA class and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KCCQ components except the self-efficacy score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strongest correlations were between NYHA class and the overall summary score (r = -0.623, p = 0.001) as well as the physical limitation score (r = -0.604, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were statistically significant positive correlations between the KCCQ components and percent predicted peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The strongest correlation was between percent predicted peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> and the physical limitation score (r = 0.474, p = 0.019), but there was also correlation between percent predicted peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> and the quality-of-life score (r = 0.456, p = 0.025), the functional status score (r = 0.455, p = 0.025), and the clinical summary score (r = 0.444, p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multiple domains of the KCCQ provide data on patient-perceived health status, which correlate with physician-perceived and objective measurement of functional capacity in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity of the KCCQ to changes in functional capacity over time or in response to therapies for this condition </plain></SENT>
