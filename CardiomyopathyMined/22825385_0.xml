<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coronary microcirculation includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the vessels which contribute to provide resistance to coronary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It represents the district where coronary circulation blood flow is regulated to ensure that each structural and functional cardiac component receives the proper amount of oxygen and metabolic substrates through the capillary network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary microcirculation is fundamental for myocardial function which largely depends on the ratio between energetic metabolites received from coronary circulation and their utilization by the myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alterations in coronary microvascular circulation which limit myocardial perfusion can cause repetitive ischemic events leading to left ventricular dysfunction in several ischemic and non ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> as the idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, mechanisms underlying microvascular dysfunction are not completely understood and experimental animal models are employed to study alterations which may cause microcirculation impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These animals models are unique tools to identify new therapeutic targets, to test new drug therapies for the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction as well as its progression towards overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
