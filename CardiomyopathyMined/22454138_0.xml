<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Reduction of resting heart rate (HR) has been suggested as a novel therapeutic approach in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> because it has been shown to prolong survival and also to improve health-related quality of life (Hr-QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was to assess the prognostic impact of resting HR in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 217 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy were investigated (age 49 ± 11 years, 20.7 % were female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population was divided into two groups according to the median of the resting HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 7.4 years overall survival and health-related quality of life (Hr-QoL) were compared in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier method and Hr-QoL was assessed using the Minnesota Living with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Questionnaire (MLHFQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated resting HR was associated with poor 1-year survival (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, long-term survival was not affected by HR (p = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower HR at rest scored significantly lower on the MLHFQ (20 vs. 36, p = 0.03), indicating that higher resting HR is associated with an impairment of Hr-QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased HR might be used as a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduction of resting HR in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> might be a therapeutic option to improve Hr-QoL and therefore merits further investigation in future studies </plain></SENT>
