<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism is unknown, it is widely believed that the reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> might prevent such alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used the standardized extract of French pine bark - Pycnogenol(Â®) (PYC) with hypoglycaemic and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties in 8-9 week old rats with experimentally (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PYC was administered orally for 6 weeks in three different doses (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg b.w., resp.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental DM was manifested by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (four to six-fold increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration; p&lt;0.05) and significantly increased mean arterial blood pressure (by 19%; p&lt;0.05) measured using catheterization of carotid artery in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both abnormalities were dose-dependently reduced by PYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was associated with a significant increase in left ventricular weight to body weight ratio (by 21%; p&lt;0.05) and a significant decrease of the width of cardiomyocytes (by 23%; p&lt;0.05) indicating cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on the one side, and hypotrophy of cardiomyocytes on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these changes were not affected by PYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently to metabolic and hemodynamic alterations, significant prolongation of QT interval (by 20%; p&lt;0.05) was present in diabetic rats, however, PYC failed to correct it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusively, PYC fails to correct QT prolongation in spite of dose-dependent reduction of glycaemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
