<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> arise from mutations in many genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomere protein titin, has been insufficiently analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations because of its enormous size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed TTN in 312 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 231 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 249 controls by using next-generation or dideoxy sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated deleterious variants for cosegregation in families and assessed clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 72 unique mutations (25 nonsense, 23 frameshift, 23 splicing, and 1 large tandem insertion) that altered full-length titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among subjects studied by means of next-generation sequencing, the frequency of TTN mutations was significantly higher among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (54 of 203 [27%]) than among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (3 of 231 [1%], P=3×10(-16)) or controls (7 of 249 [3%], P=9×10(-14)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTN mutations cosegregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in families (combined lod score, 11.1) with high (&gt;95%) observed penetrance after the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were overrepresented in the titin A-band but were absent from the Z-disk and M-band regions of titin (P≤0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the rates of cardiac outcomes were similar in subjects with and those without TTN mutations, but adverse events occurred earlier in male mutation carriers than in female carriers (P=4×10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTN truncating mutations are a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, occurring in approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and in 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of sequencing approaches that detect TTN truncations into genetic testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> should substantially increase test sensitivity, thereby allowing earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Defining the functional effects of TTN truncating mutations should improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
