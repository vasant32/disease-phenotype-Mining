<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the demographic, clinical and pathological features of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in childhood with particular reference to its classification and autopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD:   The method of this study was a retrospective structured review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> paediatric autopsies performed at a single specialist centre from 1995 to 2009 inclusive, in order to determine the demographic, clinical and pathological features of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   From a total of 2229 autopsies performed at the centre during the study period on live-born infants and children, 34 confirmed cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were identified (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than half (59%) of these cases occurred in infants (less than 1 year of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart weight of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> cases was significantly greater than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts (P &lt; 0.001), and 77% had heart weights above the 95th percentile of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expected range for age, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those over 1 year age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> cases, 50% were primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 27% were primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 34 cases (35%) presented as sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> being only made at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001522'>death in infancy</z:hpo> and childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can present as sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and encompasses a range of aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heart weight above the 95th percentile at autopsy is present in most cases but heart weight may be within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in infants </plain></SENT>
