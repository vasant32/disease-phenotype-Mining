<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the hypothesis that certain patient profiles are more likely to exhibit LV recovery during LVAD support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of data from the HeartMate II bridge to transplant (BTT) and destination therapy (DT) trials was conducted, including 490 BTT, 600 DT, and 18 compassionate-use patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,108 patients, 20 (1.8%; 10 BTT, 10 DT) were explanted owing to LV recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 33 years, and 12 patients (60%) were &lt;40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was &lt;1 year for 11 patients (61%), and the primary etiology was nonischemic (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with nonischemic etiologies and &lt;1-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 13% were explanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients required LVAD reimplantation; of the remaining 17, 16 remain alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (median 510 days), the mean ejection fraction was 42% (20%-67%) and the mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 55 ± 8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the 2-year follow-up (n = 13), patients were New York Heart Association functional class I or II and overall survival rate was 85 ± 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that LV recovery is most likely to occur in young patients (&lt;40 years) with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> of &lt;1 year duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two-year postexplant survival was excellent </plain></SENT>
