<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) where some aspect of the marker channel was missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two cases were caused by the simultaneous occurrence of two distinct cardiac or device events that affected the proper delivery of markers by the telemetry system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inability of the devices to sequentially process these events resulted in incomplete transmission of telemetry data to the programmers and caused missing markers in the telemetry recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the third case, sensed atrial interference resulted in a short period of atrial asynchronous pacing, which prevented the delivery of a sensed atrial marker coincident with an atrial electrogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This atrial electrogram by virtue of its timing would have otherwise been sensed outside the atrial refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The perplexing recordings of the three patients should not be interpreted as representing true pacemaker malfunction </plain></SENT>
