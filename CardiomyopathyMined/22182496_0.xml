<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrate that women may respond more favorably to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) than do men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of gender on response to CRT and to explore potential mechanisms behind these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 846 patients from the SMART-AV trial were used to evaluate the mechanisms behind the effects of gender on CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular optimization (AVO) was performed via SmartDelay or echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline and 6-month left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVi) were fitted to a linear regression model with gender predicting change in LVESVi and adjusted for baseline covariates significantly differing by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction variable for AVO and gender was also assessed for its effect on change in LVESVi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline variables, including age, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, QRS width, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms, were comparable between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> conduction and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and exhibited greater reductions in LVESVi even after adjustment for these differences (13.4 mL/m(2) vs 8.5 mL/m(2); P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, women had greater percentages of biventricular pacing and appeared to derive greater reductions in left ventricular volume with AVO than did men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women demonstrated greater reductions in LVESVi with CRT than did men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations are not explained by differences in baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Greater degrees of biventricular pacing and enhanced response to AVO in women may partly explain the reason for the gender effect on CRT response </plain></SENT>
