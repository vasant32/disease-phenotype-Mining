<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present their clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and prognosis on the basis of a selective review of the literature, current expert opinion, and our own clinical experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pathological mechanisms that are accessible to treatment lie at the cellular and molecular levels and generally give rise to nonspecific disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific treatment is possible only on the basis of a standardized diagnostic evaluation of a biopsy specimen, rather than clinical examination alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic decisions must be based on the results of thorough myocardial biopsy studies while taking account of the individual patient's clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment can help only if a treatable cause is present (e.g., a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, an inflammatory process, or cardiodepressive antibodies), and only if the myocardium still has regenerative potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once irreversible myocardial injury has occurred-for example, if the diagnosis of post-infectious or post-inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been missed until it is too late-then the development or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in the long term can no longer be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recent studies have shown that specific treatment can help patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, inflammatory, or autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that has been precisely characterized by means of a myocardial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More randomized trials with larger patient cohorts are needed for further optimization of treatment </plain></SENT>
