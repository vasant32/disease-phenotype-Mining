<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Triggered by a physiological insult, maladaptive neurohumoral processes result in an ever-spiralling deterioration of cardiovascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are certain underlying conditions which are associated with a temporary reduction in contractile function leading to reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conditions affect a relatively small number of patients when compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> secondary to inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are two broad mechanisms responsible for reversible myocyte dysfunction: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory activation in which cytokines depress myocyte function, and toxic effects in which there is impairment of intra-cellular energetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> caused by toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects can be caused by drugs (prescribed and illicit) and by tachycardic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (tachycardiomyopathy), and are caused by abnormalities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and myocytic calcium processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathological mechanisms, clinical features and management options are discussed, illustrated by clinical case studies </plain></SENT>
