<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the condition is relatively prevalent, it is important for anesthesiologist to be aware of the pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we draw upon case reports and studies of the anesthesia management of patients with hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to enhance medical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scope of this article ranges from the preoperative period, when the severity of the obstruction needs to be assessed; the intraoperative period, with monitoring, as well as general management guidelines; and finally, the postoperative period, when it is important to minimize the sympathetic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we address the management of the obstetric patient, with particular focus on neuraxial anesthesia, and extrapolate how this type of anesthesia may be applied to the management of patients undergoing nonlaboring, noncardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
