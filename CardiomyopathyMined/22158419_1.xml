<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of the TP63 gene in 1998, many studies have demonstrated that Î”Np63, a p63 isoform of the p53 gene family, is involved in multiple functions during skin development and in adult stem/progenitor cell regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TAp63 studies have been mostly restricted to its apoptotic function and more recently as the guardian of oocyte integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TAp63 endogenous expression is barely detectable in embryos and adult (except in oocytes), presumably because of its rapid degradation and the lack of antibodies able to detect weak expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, two recent independent studies have demonstrated novel functions for TAp63 that could have potential implications to human pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first discovery is related to the protective role of TAp63 on <z:mp ids='MP_0003786'>premature aging</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAp63 controls skin homeostasis by maintaining dermal and epidermal progenitor/stem cell pool and protecting them from senescence, DNA damage and genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second study is related to the role of TAp63, expressed by the primitive endoderm, on heart development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This unexpected role for TAp63 has been discovered by manipulation of embryonic stem cells in vitro and confirmed by the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> observed in brdm2 p63-null embryonic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in both cases, TAp63 acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner on adjacent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we discuss these findings and their potential connection during development </plain></SENT>
