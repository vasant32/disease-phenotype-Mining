<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 120 children diagnosed with HCM between 1971 and 2006 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available echocardiograms (n=685) were incorporated in regression analyses adjusted for repeated measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiphase parametric models and competing risks methodology were used to define outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (peak gradient&gt;30 mm Hg) developed in 61 (50%) of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of obstructive features occurred during 2 discrete periods of risk; either during infancy (within 3 years of age), or otherwise later during early adolescence and beyond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among children with obstructive HCM, the following 2 distinct groups were apparent: (1) those with peak LVOT gradients less than 65 mm Hg showed hemodynamic improvement (p&lt;0.001) with medical strategies; and (2) those with peak gradients greater than 65 mm Hg instead had accelerated septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (p&lt;0.001) with progression of peak gradients (p&lt;0.01), and therefore underwent myectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myectomy restored the gradient (mean 57 mm Hg reduction, 95% confidence interval 25 to 88, p&lt;0.01) to nonobstructive levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, peak gradients and septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> did not progress thereafter; they instead mirrored the natural history of nonobstructive HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, in our experience, obstructive disease (or need for myectomy) did not influence late risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with children with nonobstructive HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive HCM is phenotypically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peak gradients less than 65 mm Hg respond well to nonsurgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient subset with higher gradients (&gt;65 mm Hg) instead responds poorly and early myectomy should be pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reassuringly, late survival in this cohort was not compromised by development of obstructive symptoms </plain></SENT>
