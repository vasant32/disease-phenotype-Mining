<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> due to familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (FAP) includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, thickened cardiac walls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> and cardiac denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired blood pressure variability has been documented in FAP related to the Val30Met mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To document blood pressure variability in FAP patients with various mutation types and its relationship to the severity of cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure variability was analysed in 49 consecutive FAP patients and was compared with a matched control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac evaluation included echocardiography, right heart catheterization, electrophysiological study, Holter electrocardiogram and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-dipping</z:e> pattern was found in 80% of FAP patients and in 35% of control patients (P&lt;0.0001); this was due to a significantly lower diurnal blood pressure in FAP patients (FAP group, 113 ± 21 mmHg; control group, 124 ± 8 mmHg; P&lt;0.0001), whereas nocturnal blood pressures were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among FAP patients, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-dipping</z:e> pattern was significantly associated with haemodynamic involvement, cardiac thickening or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations did not depend on the average blood pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impaired blood pressure variability was more frequent and more pronounced in patients with multiple criteria for severe cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Low blood pressure</z:hpo> variability is common in cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> due to FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-dipping</z:e> pattern was more frequently observed in FAP patients with haemodynamic impairment, cardiac thickening or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that impairment of circadian rhythm of blood pressure reflects the severity of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> due to FAP </plain></SENT>
