<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 67 otherwise healthy diabetic patients, and a control group (n = 84) in regard to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Dopplere-chocardiography, and ECG for both groups; and disease duration, HbA1C, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> for DM 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diastolic alterations [(A and E mitral waves, E/A ratio, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and E wave deceleration time (EWDT)] were found in diabetic patients, with higher prevalence among pubertal girls (13-17 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IVRT and EWDT correlated positively with BMI (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chronological age and disease duration were predictive factors for mitral A wave (p = 0.004 and 0.033, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DF alterations were detected in the group of diabetic patients, with greater prevalence among pubertal girls; disease duration and age influenced parameters of DF </plain></SENT>
