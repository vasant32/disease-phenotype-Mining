<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sarcomeric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotypic expressions, of which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> is the most feared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic diagnosis is essential to identify subjects at risk in each family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of disease-causing mutations in the Portuguese population is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven unrelated probands with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were systematically screened for mutations by PCR and sequencing of five sarcomeric genes: MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and MYL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Familial cosegregation analysis was performed in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four different mutations were identified in 41 (53%) index patients, 71% with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently involved gene was MYBPC3 (66%) with 22 different mutations (8 novel) in 27 patients, followed by MYH7 (22%), TNNT2 (12%) and TNNI3 (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients (7%), two mutations were found in MYBPC3 and/or MYH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 276 relatives were screened, leading to the identification of a mean of three other affected relatives for each pedigree with the familial form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disease-associated mutations were identified mostly in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, corroborating the idea that rarely studied genes may be implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Private mutations are the rule, MYBPC3 being the most commonly involved gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutations in MYBPC3 and MYH7 accounted for most cases of sarcomere-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple mutations in these genes may occur, which highlights the importance of screening both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The detection of novel mutations strongly suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding regions should be systematically screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genotyping in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> enables a more precise diagnosis of the disease, with implications for risk stratification and genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
