<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cardiovascular screening with resting 12-lead ECG analysis of 1220 national level athletes (800 West-Asian, 300 black and 120 Caucasian) and 135 West-Asian controls was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten per cent of athletes presented with 'uncommon' ECG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Black African descent was an independent predictor of 'uncommon' ECG changes when compared with West-Asian and Caucasian athletes (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Black athletes also demonstrated a significantly greater prevalence of lateral T-wave inversions than both West-Asian and Caucasian athletes (6.1% vs 1.6% and 0%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of 'uncommon' ECG changes between West-Asian and Caucasian athletes was comparable (7.9% vs 5.8%, p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven athletes (0.6%) were identified with a disease associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>; this prevalence was two times higher in black athletes than in West-Asian athletes (1% vs 0.5%), and no cases were reported in Caucasian athletes and West-Asian controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen West-Asian and black athletes were identified with repolarisation abnormalities suggestive of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but ultimately, none were diagnosed with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: West-Asian and Caucasian athletes demonstrate comparable rates of ECG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Black African ethnicity is positively associated with increased frequencies of 'uncommon' ECG traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future work should examine the genetic mechanisms behind ECG and myocardial adaptations in athletes of diverse ethnicity, aiding in the clinical differentiation between physiological remodelling and potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or ion channel disorders </plain></SENT>
