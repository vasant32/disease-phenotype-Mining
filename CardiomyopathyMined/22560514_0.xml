<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autopsy studies in these patients, including histochemical examinations of multiple skeletal muscles, have not yet been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe the autopsy findings of a patient with inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old man, who was a human T lymphotropic virus type 1 carrier, exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, predominantly affecting the scapular, quadriceps femoris, and forearm flexor muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His disease course was more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> than that typically observed; the patient died suddenly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> 5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy findings revealed that multiple muscles, including the respiratory muscles, were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies revealed an increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003805'>rimmed vacuoles</z:hpo> and p62/sequestosome 1- and/or TAR DNA-binding protein 43-positive deposits in autopsied muscles, although the amount of inflammatory infiltrate appeared to be decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We speculated that <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> may be more closely involved in disease progression compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis revealed a myosin binding protein C3 mutation, which is reportedly responsible for familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mutation and human T lymphotropic virus type 1 infection may have affected the skeletal muscles of this patient </plain></SENT>
