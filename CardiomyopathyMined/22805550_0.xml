<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>) develop progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In screening studies in patients with LVH, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> ranges from 0 to 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This variability is attributable to different factors like diverging inclusion and exclusion criteria, the evaluation of selected populations and suboptimal screening methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> in an unselected population of everyday clinical practice presenting LVH, defined as a maximal end-diastolic septal or posterior wall thickness ≥13mm, without exclusion of patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or valvular pathology, and using optimal screening methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In adult males, a two-tier approach was used; α-Galactosidase A (aGAL A) activity was measured using a dried bloodspot test (DBS) and diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis of the GLA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In females, mutation analysis was the primary screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 362 men and 178 women were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients were diagnosed with a genetic sequence alteration of the GLA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One man had a novel mutation, GLA p.Ala5Glu (c.44C&gt;A), presenting as classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Another man and three women had the previously described GLA p.Ala143Thr (c.427G&gt;A) mutation, which generally presents as an attenuated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One woman had a novel sequence alteration c.639+6A&gt;C, which appeared to be a polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> true Fabry patients had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AHT), and one had hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HOCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a group of unselected patients with LVH, we found a prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> of 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AHT or type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> should not be an exclusion criterion for screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
