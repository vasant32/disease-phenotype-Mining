<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over 100 amyloidogenic mutations have been identified in TTR which destabilize the TTR tetramer thereby inducing the formation of amyloid fibrils in tissues such as the heart and peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disease mainly affects peripheral nerves, causing familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (FAP) or heart, causing familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (FAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating TTR is predominantly produced by liver, and the only widely available clinical treatment for FAP is orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), whereas no treatment currently exists for FAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using second-generation antisense technology, we identified an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting TTR, ISIS-TTR(Rx), for the treatment of TTR-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When tested in a human TTR transgenic mouse model (hTTR Ile84Ser), ISIS-TTR(Rx) showed a dose-dependent reduction of human TTR (up to &gt;80%) at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cynomolgus monkeys, ISIS-TTR(Rx) treatment produced a time-dependent reduction in plasma TTR levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks of treatment in monkey, liver TTR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and plasma TTR protein levels were reduced by ~80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, treatment with ISIS-TTR(Rx) also produced a significant decrease in plasma RBP4 levels that correlated with reductions in TTR levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ISIS-TTR(Rx) treatment was well tolerated in both rodents and monkeys and produced a PK/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> profile consistent with prior experiences using this chemistry platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ISIS-TTR(Rx) is currently under evaluation in a Phase 1 clinical trial in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers, and interim results of this trial will be presented </plain></SENT>
