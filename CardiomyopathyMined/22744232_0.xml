<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the responsible mechanisms are largely unknown, it is demonstrated that DOX induces an elevation in the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase isoenzyme, lactic dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase, and troponin T in serum and reduces body/heart weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, cardiotoxicity is further confirmed by changes in ECG parameters and papillary muscle contractile force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tropisetron is an effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> drug for chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>emesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is ample evidence that tropisetron exerts immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of tropisetron pretreatment against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, DOX toxicity was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection (15 mg/kg), and in treated group, tropisetron (3 mg/kg; i.p) was administered 1 h prior to DOX injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that tropisetron potently decreased body/heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and mortality rate and also improved ECG changes as well as heart contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, tropisetron robustly counteracted the increase in the levels of serum biomarkers and alleviated the histopathological changes in rats' hearts as compared with the DOX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate that tropisetron has potent cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
