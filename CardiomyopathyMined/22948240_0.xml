<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The high and increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) represents a serious public health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New technologies are being used aiming at more accurate diagnoses in order to improve therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) uses natural myocardial markers to analyze the systolic deformation of the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the longitudinal transmural global strain (GS) of the LV through STE in patients with severe <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, comparing the results with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and with echocardiographic parameters established for the analysis of LV systolic function, validating the method in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 71 patients with severe <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (53 ± 12 years, 72% men) and 20 controls (30 ± 8 years, 45% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained LV volumes and ejection fraction by two and three-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler parameters, tissue Doppler and GS was obtained by STE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, LV volumes were higher in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group; however, LVEF and peak velocity of E wave were lower in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The myocardial performance index was higher among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocardial velocities at the tissue Doppler (S', e', a') were significantly lower and E/e' ratio was higher in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The GS was decreased in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group (-5.5% ± 2.3%) when compared to controls (-14.0% ± 1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, GS was significantly lower in patients with severe <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, bringing new perspectives for therapeutic approaches in this specific population </plain></SENT>
