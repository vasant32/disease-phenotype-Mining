<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of stressor patterns on clinical features, laboratory parameters, and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings in patients with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Methods: Of 137 patients enrolled from the TTC registry database, 14 patients had emotional triggers (E group), 96 had physical triggers (P group), and 27 had no triggers (N group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most clinical presentations and in-hospital courses were similar among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the E group had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (P = 0.006) and palpitation (P = 0.006), whereas the P group had a higher prevalence of cardiogenic shock (P = 0.040), than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P group had a significantly higher heart rate (P = 0.001); higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.006), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase MB fraction (P = 0.045), and N terminal-probrain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (P = 0.036) levels; higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (P = 0.019) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (P = 0.002); but lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E group had lesser prevalence of apical ballooning pattern (P = 0.038) than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P group required more frequent use of inotropics (P = 0.041) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (P = 0.047) and had significantly longer intensive care unit (P = 0.014) and in-hospital stays (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of TTC are different according to preceding stressor patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TTC group with preceding physical stressors was less likely to have preserved cardiovascular reserve and more likely to require hemodynamic support than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall prognosis of TTC is excellent, regardless of triggering stressors </plain></SENT>
