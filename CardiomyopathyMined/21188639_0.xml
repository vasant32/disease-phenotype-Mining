<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is based on the hypothesis that scintigraphy can be applied to calculate the myocardial 99 mTc-MIBI washout rate (WR) to diagnose and evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> severity and other left ventricular functional parameters specifically in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with IDCMP (n = 17; 52.65 ± 11.47 years) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 6; 49.67 ± 10.15 years) were intravenously administered 99 mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, early and delayed planar data were acquired (at 3.5-h intervals), and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 99 mTc-MIBI WR was calculated using early and delayed planar images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular functional parameters were also analyzed using quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In target group, myocardial WRs (29.13 ± 6.68%) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (14.17 ± 3.31%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 99 mTc-MIBI WR increased with the increasing severity of the NYHA functional class (23.16 ± 1.72% for class I, 30.25 ± 0.95% for class II, 32.60 ± 6.73% for class III, and 37.50 ± 7.77% for class IV; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The WR was positively correlated with the end-diastolic volume (EDV) index (r (2) = 0.216; β = 0.464; P = 0.02 [ml/m(2)], the end-systolic volume (ESV) index (r (2) = 0.234; β = 0.484; P = 0.01 [ml/m(2)]), the summed motion score (SMS) (r (2) = 0.544; β = 0.738; P = 0.00), and the summed thickening score (STS) (r (2) = 0.656; β = 0.810; P = 0.00); it was negatively correlated with the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r (2) = 0.679; β = -0.824; P = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy might be a valuable molecular imaging tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of myocardial damage or dysfunction severity </plain></SENT>
