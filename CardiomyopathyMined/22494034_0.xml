<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is linked to several factors including specific transthyretin mutations, geographic distribution and endemic vs. non-endemic aggregation type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The existence of exclusively or predominantly cardiac phenotypes makes the recognition of the disease very challenging since it can mimic other more common causes of left ventricular "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment of such patients should include an active search for possible red flags that can indicate the correct final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
