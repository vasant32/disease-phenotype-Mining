<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BackgroundAlthough the pathophysiology and treatment of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) are well studied, HF in children remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated adaptation plays a central role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> in HF, and these patients respond well to β-blocker (BB) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in children with HF, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a lack of efficacy of adult HF therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to these unanticipated differences in response to therapy and the paucity of data regarding the molecular adaptation of the paediatric heart, we investigated the molecular characteristics of HF in children.Methods and resultsExplanted hearts from adults and children with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and non-failing controls were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the molecular characteristics of paediatric HF are strikingly different from their adult counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences include: (i) down-regulation of β(1)- and β(2)-AR in children, whereas β(2)-AR expression is maintained in adults; (ii) up-regulation of connexin43 in children, whereas down-regulation is observed in adults; (iii) no differences in phosphatase expression, whereas up-regulation is observed in adults; (iv) no decrease in the phosphorylation of phospholamban at the Ser16 or Thr17 sites in children, which are known characteristics of adult HF.ConclusionThere is a different adaptation of β-AR and adrenergic signalling pathways in children with HF compared with adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results begin to address the disparities in cardiovascular research specific to children and suggest that age-related differences in adaptation could influence the response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings could lead to a paradigm shift in the contemporary management of children with HF </plain></SENT>
