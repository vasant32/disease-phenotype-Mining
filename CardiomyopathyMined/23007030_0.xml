<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of variants in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-response genes with phenotype severity in pediatric HCM.Methods:Eighty unrelated patients &lt;21 years old and 14 related members from 8 families with HCM were genotyped for 6 variants associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) downregulation, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF1A) upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations between risk genotypes and left ventricular (LV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, LV dysfunction, and freedom from myectomy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue expression was measured in myocardial samples from 17 HCM and 20 non-HCM patients.Results:Age at enrolment was 9±5 years (follow-up, 3.1±3.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk allele frequency was 67% VEGFA and 92% HIF1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk genotypes were associated with younger age at diagnosis (p&lt;0.001), septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (p&lt;0.01), prolonged E-wave deceleration time (p&lt;0.0001) and isovolumic relaxation time (p&lt;0.0001) and lower freedom from myectomy (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial HCM independent of the disease-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk genotypes were associated with higher myocardial HIF1A and TGFB1 expression and increased endothelial-fibroblast transformation (p&lt;0.05).Conclusions:HIF1A upregulation and/or VEGFA downregulation genotypes were associated with more severe septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and diastolic dysfunction and may provide genetic markers to improve risk prediction in HCM.Pediatric Research (2012); doi:10.1038/pr.2012.126 </plain></SENT>
