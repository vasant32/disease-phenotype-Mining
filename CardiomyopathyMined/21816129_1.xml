<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While in the older populations, SCD is most frequently caused by underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, in those aged under 40 years, the causes of SCD commonly include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>, such as inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and primary arrhythmogenic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As part of the evaluation of families in which SCD has occurred, the role of genetic testing has evolved as an important feature in both establishing an underlying diagnosis and in screening at-risk family relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in cases where no definitive cause is identified at postmortem, i.e. Sudden Unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> (SUD), the "molecular autopsy" has emerged as a key process in the investigation of the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of clinical and genetic evaluation of families in which SUD has occurred provides a platform for early initiation of therapeutic and prevention strategies, with the ultimate goal to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> among the young in our communities </plain></SENT>
