<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and myocardial injury in children with critical diseases in light of the fact that such children usually suffer from noticeable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three children with critical diseases who were admitted between March 2010 and June 2011 were enrolled to comprise a case group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum insulin, myocardial enzyme, and troponin I (CTnI) levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The children were classified into two groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR&gt;1.0; n=30) and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR≤1.0; n=33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty healthy children served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HOMA-IR, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferaseaspartate transaminase (AST), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK), isoenzymes of creating kinase (CK-MB), α-hydroxybuty rate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) and CTnI in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> group were higher than those in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the control groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> group also showed obviously higher levels in terms of LDH, AST, CK, CK-MB, α-HBDH, and CTnI than the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> group, there exists a positive correlation between HOMA-IR and such indicators as LDH, CK, CK-MB, AST, α-HBDH and CTnI (r=0.697, 0.739, 0.781, 0.642, 0.381, 0.792 respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> makes myocardial injury more serious; HOMA-IR can serve as a forecast indicator for the degree of myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
