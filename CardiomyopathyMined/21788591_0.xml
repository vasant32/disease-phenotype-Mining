<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) is the leading indication for heart transplantation after 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors by etiology at clinical presentation have not been determined separately for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and transplantation in population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competing risks analysis may inform patient prioritization for transplantation <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry enrolled 1731 children diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> from 1990 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Etiologic, demographic, and echocardiographic data collected at diagnosis were analyzed with competing risks methods stratified by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> etiology to identify predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n=1192), diagnosis after 6 years of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and lower left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening z score were independently associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and transplantation equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increased LV end-diastolic dimension z score was associated only with transplantation, whereas lower height-for-age z score was associated only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disease</z:e> (n=139), lower LV fractional shortening was associated equally with both end points, but increased LV end-diastolic dimension was associated only with transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and transplantation were increased equally for older age at diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and increased LV end-diastolic dimension among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (n=272) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and decreased LV fractional shortening among those with familial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n=79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and transplantation in children varied by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, increased LV end-diastolic dimension was associated with increased transplantation risk but not mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> was significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but not transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may present an opportunity to improve the transplantation selection algorithm </plain></SENT>
