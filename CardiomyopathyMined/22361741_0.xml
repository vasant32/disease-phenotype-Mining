<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that the mammalian heart possesses some capacity for cardiac regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This regenerative capacity is primarily documented postnatally and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or pressure overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the cell type that mediates endogenous regeneration is unclear, cardiac stem cells might be considered as potential candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the number of c-kit + cardiac resident cells under conditions of pressure overload, we evaluated specimens derived from n = 8 patients with pressure overloaded single right ventricles in comparison to n = 4 explanted hearts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and n = 14 biopsies from children after heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age of the patients ranged from 16 days to 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For quantification of cardiac stem cells, c-kit+/mast cell tryptase-/CD45- cells were counted and expressed as percent of the total nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 0.13 ± 0.09% c-kit +/mast cell tryptase-/CD45- cells were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in specimens from patients with pressure overloaded single right ventricles, the numbers of c-kit+/mast cell tryptase-/CD45- cells were significantly higher (0.41 ±0.24%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of pressure overload, the right ventricle shows an approximately three-fold increase in c-kit+/mast cell tryptase-/CD45- cardiac resident cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that this increased number of c-kit+ cells is not sufficient to prevent the failing heart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, understanding the mechanism that leads to an increase of presumably cardiac resident stem cells under conditions of pressure overload might help to develop new strategies to enhance endogenous repair </plain></SENT>
