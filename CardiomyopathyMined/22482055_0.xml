<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> are typically dose-dependent, irreversible, and cumulative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although past studies of cardiotoxicity have focused on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, more recently interest has turned to anticancer drugs that target many proteins kinases, such as tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An attractive model to explain the mechanism of this cardiotoxicity could be myocyte loss through cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transition permeability is a valuable tool to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> treatment, activation of several protein kinases, neuregulin/ErbB2 signaling, and transcriptional factors modify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> functions that determine cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival through the modulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> is also modulated by a myriad of transcriptional factors that influence cell fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several novel targeted chemotherapeutic agents have been associated with a small but worrying risk of left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agents such as trastuzumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> can lead to cardiotoxicity that is fundamentally different from that caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, whereas biological effects converge to the mitochondria as a critical target </plain></SENT>
