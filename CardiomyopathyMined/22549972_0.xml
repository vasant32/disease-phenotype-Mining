<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate if left ventricular outflow tract/aortic valve (LVOT/AO) diameter ratio measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an accurate marker for LVOT obstruction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) compared to Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 92 patients with HCM were divided into three groups based on their resting echocardiographic LVOT pressure gradient (PG): &lt;30 mmHg at rest (nonobstructive, n = 31), &lt;30 mmHg at rest, &gt;30 mmHg after provocation (latent, n = 29), and &gt;30 mmHg at rest (obstructive, n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end-systolic dimension of the LVOT on 3-chamber steady-state free precession (SSFP) CMR was divided by the end diastolic aortic valve diameter to calculate the LVOT/AO diameter ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences in the LVOT/AO diameter ratio among the three subgroups (nonobstructive 0.60 ± 0.13, latent 0.41 ± 0.16, obstructive 0.24 ± 0.09, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong linear inverse correlation between the LVOT/AO diameter ratio and the log of the LVOT pressure gradient (r = -0.84, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For detection of a resting gradient &gt;30 mmHg, the LVOT/AO diameter ratio the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For detection of a resting and/or provoked gradient &gt;30 mmHg, the LVOT/AO diameter ratio area under the ROC curve was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The LVOT/AO diameter ratio is an accurate, reproducible, noninvasive, and easy to use CMR marker to assess LVOT pressure gradients in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
