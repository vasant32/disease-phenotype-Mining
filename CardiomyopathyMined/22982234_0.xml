<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite early demonstrations of myosin binding protein C's (MyBP-C) interaction with actin, different investigators have reached different conclusions regarding the relevant and necessary domains mediating this binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishing the detailed structure-function relationships is needed to fully understand cMyBP-C's ability to impact on myofilament contraction as mutations in different domains are causative for familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined cMyBP-C's N-terminal structural domains that are necessary or sufficient to mediate interactions with actin and/or the head region of the myosin heavy chain (S2-MyHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of genetics and functional assays, we defined the actin binding site(s) present in cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that cMyBP-C's C1 and m domains productively interact with actin, while S2-MyHC interactions are restricted to the m domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using residue-specific mutagenesis, we identified the critical actin binding residues and distinguished them from the residues that were critical for S2-MyHC binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To validate the structural and functional significance of these residues, we silenced the endogenous cMyBP-C in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRC) using cMyBP-C siRNA, and replaced the endogenous cMyBP-C with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or actin binding-ablated cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Replacement with actin binding-ablated cMyBP-C showed that the mutated protein did not incorporate into the sarcomere normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Residues responsible for actin and S2-MyHC binding are partially present in overlapping domains but are unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of an actin binding-deficient cMyBP-C resulted in abnormal cytosolic distribution of the protein, indicating that interaction with actin is essential for the formation and/or maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cMyBP-C sarcomeric distribution </plain></SENT>
