<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in MYL3, encoding the essential light chain of myosin, are rare and have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both recessive and dominant patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a large family with a 38-year-old asymptomatic HCM-affected male referred because of a murmur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had HCM with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (max WT 21 mm), a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 36 mm Hg, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004063'>left atrial dilation</z:mp> (54���mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping revealed heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation, p.V79I, in MYL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was not found in 300 controls, and the patient had no mutations in 10 sarcomere genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cascade screening revealed a further nine heterozygote mutation carriers, three of whom had ECG and/or echocardiographic abnormalities but did not fulfil diagnostic criteria for HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The penetrance, if we consider this borderline HCM the phenotype of the p.V79I mutation, was 40%, but the mean age of the nonpenetrant mutation carriers is 15, while the mean age of the penetrant mutation carriers is 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation affects a conserved valine replacing it with a larger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32615">isoleucine residue</z:chebi> in the region of contact between the light chain and the myosin lever arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MYL3 mutations can present with low expressivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
