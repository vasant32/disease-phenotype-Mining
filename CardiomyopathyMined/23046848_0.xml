<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCM is a cause of disability, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, with an annual mortality varying from 1% to 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) is extremely common among patients with established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and when present may contribute to worse cardiovascular outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although patients with HCM do not necessarily have typical characteristics of patients with OSA, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and increasing age, there is recent evidence that OSA is extremely common among patients with HCM, with a prevalence ranging from 32% to 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of OSA among patients with HCM is independently associated with worse structural and functional impairment of the heart, including atrial and aorta enlargement, worse New York Heart Association functional class, and worse quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of atria <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, an independent marker of mortality among patients with HCM, is significantly higher (âˆ¼four times) in the presence of OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the recognition of OSA is a new area of research that may impact the management of patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
