<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sixteen HCM families with pathogenic mutation were studied and 46 patients with phenotype expression (Mut+/Phen+) and 47 patients without phenotype expression (Mut+/Phen-) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five control subjects, matched with the Mut+/Phen- group, were recruited for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed to evaluate conventional parameters, myocardial structural alteration by calibrated integrated backscatter (cIBS) and global and segmental longitudinal strain by speckle tracking analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 groups had similar left ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal anteroseptal cIBS was the highest in Mut+/Phen+ patients (-14.0±4.6 dB, p&lt;0.01) and was higher in Mut+/Phen- patients as compared to controls (-17.0±2.3 vs. -22.6±2.9 dB, p&lt;0.01) suggesting significant myocardial structural alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global and basal anteroseptal longitudinal strains (-8.4±4.0%, p&lt;0.01) were the most impaired in Mut+/Phen+ patients as compared to the other 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although global longitudinal strain was similar between Mut+/Phen- group and controls, basal anteroseptal strain was lower in Mut+/Phen- patients (-14.1±3.8%, p&lt;0.01) as compared to controls (-19.9±2.9%, p&lt;0.01), suggesting a subclinical segmental systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of &gt;-19.0 dB basal anteroseptal cIBS or &gt;-18.0% basal anteroseptal longitudinal strain had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 72% in differentiating Mut+/Phen- group from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of cIBS and segmental longitudinal strain can differentiate HCM Mut+/Phen- patients from controls with important clinical implications for the family screening and follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
