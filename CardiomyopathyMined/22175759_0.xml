<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To define the role of focal and reentrant mechanisms underlying nonsustained (NSVT) and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (SuVT) induced by programmed stimulation, 3-dimensional cardiac mapping was performed in 8 dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) created by multiple intracoronary microsphere embolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Continuous recording from 232 intramural sites throughout the left and right ventricles and the interventricular septum was performed during programmed stimulation in the absence and presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (Iso, 0.1 μg/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sinus beats and the last extrastimuli preceding induced VT conducted with total activation times (TA) of 51 ± 10 and 111 ± 8 milliseconds, respectively, that did not change during Iso infusion (47 ± 4 and 109 ± 5 milliseconds, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NSVT was induced in 75% of HF dogs; SuVT was induced in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, initiation and maintenance of SuVT and NSVT arose by a focal mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to NSVT, SuVT had a shorter coupling interval (CI; 150 ± 7 vs 186 ± 16, P &lt; 0.05) and a predilection for certain critical subendocardial initiation sites (that were initiation sites for only 29% of NSVT beats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 21-30 beats, acceleration of SuVT by a focal mechanism to a CI less than 120 milliseconds led to functional conduction delay (TA increasing from 111 ± 3 to 137 ± 3 milliseconds, P &lt; 0.0001), intramural reentry, and transition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, initiation of SuVT in a model of ischemic HF is due to a focal mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent acceleration of this focal mechanism can ultimately lead to functional conduction delay and development of intramural reentry </plain></SENT>
