<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an extremely rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in nonagenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> for the first time at 90 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was isolated left ventricular noncompaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography showed a trabeculated, sponge-like appearance of the left ventricular apical and inferolateral segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After medical management, the patient was asymptomatic at the 3-month follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of ventricular noncompaction is increasing within the cardiology community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who have isolated noncompaction with a limited number of involved ventricular segments can live beyond <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy without developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
