<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of chronically stabilized cardiac HIF-1α and its role in the diseased heart are not precisely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were as follows: (i) to elucidate consequences of HIF-1α stabilization in the heart; (ii) to analyse long-term effects of HIF-1α stabilization with ageing and the ability of the HIF-1α overexpressing hearts to respond to increased mechanical load; and (iii) to analyse HIF-1α protein levels in failing heart samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cardiac-specific HIF-1α transgenic mouse model, constitutive expression of HIF-1α leads to changes in capillary area and shifts the cardiac metabolism towards glycolysis with a net increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Ca(2+) handling is altered, with increased Ca(2)(+) transients and faster intracellular [Ca(2+)] decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes are associated with decreased expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a but elevated phosphorylation of phospholamban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIF-1α transgenic mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction exhibited profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CHF|chf">cardiac decompensation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was also seen in ageing transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, we found an increased stabilization of HIF-1α in heart samples of patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Changes induced with transgenic cardiac HIF-1α possibly mediate beneficial effects in the short term; however, with increased mechanical load and ageing they become detrimental for cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together with the finding of increased HIF-1α protein levels in samples from human patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, these data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HIF-1α stabilization drives autonomous pathways that add to disease progression </plain></SENT>
