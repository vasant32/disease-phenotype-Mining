<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients referred for echocardiography with moderate or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, assessed according to the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography, were included prospectively in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between October 2006 and February 2008, a total of 276 patients (157 females, 119 males; mean age 61 +/- 20 years) were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of evaluation, 67% of the patients were outpatients and the remainder were hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NYHA functional class was III-IV in 31% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main echocardiographic data were: color flow jet area 11 +/- 5 cm2, vena contracta 6.7 +/- 1.9 mm, effective regurgitant orifice area 0.46 +/- 0.28 cm2, left ventricular diastolic and systolic diameters 58 +/- 10 mm and 39 +/- 12 mm, respectively, left ventricular ejection fraction 0.55 +/- 0.19, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure 39 +/- 16 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was degenerative in 42% of patients, rheumatic in 22%, functional due to idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 18%, functional due to ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 7%, congenital in 7%, and had other causes in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among this Spanish population, the majority of the moderate or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> encountered was organic, with degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865573" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral disease</z:e> as the most common etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional regurgitation was present in a significant proportion of patients, with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> being the most frequent cause </plain></SENT>
