<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Molecular characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> now includes the not infrequent dysmorphic Noonan syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study of 6 genes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-MAPK pathway in Spanish patients is presented: the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, clinical expressivity, and diagnostic yield are investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 643 patients (and 182 family members) diagnosed by dysmorphologists, cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists from 74 tertiary hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional sequencing analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, KRAS and HRAS focused on exons carrying recurrent mutations accounting for 80% to 95% of previously described mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations were detected in 230 patients (91 women and 139 men) in 200 (31%) families (172 PTPN11+, 14 SOS1+, 9 RAF1+, 5 BRAF+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was specific reference to the heart defect suffered in 156 index cases: 103 patients had shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo>, 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> with hyperthrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 18 hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, and 14 other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathies</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was absent in 9 index cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e> had not been documented in 23 of 30 family members with positive genotype and compatible clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic yield was higher (P=.016) for samples from some centers (53%; 14/32) and even from certain professionals (64%; 9/14; P=.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Characterization rate was 18% in patients for whom clinical data were not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotyping led to a more precise diagnosis in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients (94%) with a positive genotype had known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, 79% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> and 12% hyperthrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiopathy</z:e> had not been documented in 76% of family members carrying the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Molecular study is a useful tool in these syndromes but a more rigorous clinical diagnosis should be intended as well </plain></SENT>
