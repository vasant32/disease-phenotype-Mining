<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to use genetic mutation analysis to determine the cause of sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in young (SUDY) persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> autopsy findings, and to provide relatives with an identified cardiac mutation with suitable cardiovascular prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed mutation analysis on blood samples from first-degree relatives of 25 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> autopsy findings identified in the national Swedish study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in 15- to 35-year-olds from 1992 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found three families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> through mutation screening, and the mutations were verified in two of the deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight family members were found to be mutation carriers and have been provided with suitable cardiovascular prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening also identified a number of common polymorphisms in the individuals screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical history revealed one family each with short QT syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, respectively, but no mutations were found in the family members or in the deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two SCDs each had occurred in two of the affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac/genetic evaluation of relatives long after SUDY can reveal a diagnosis in 5/25 (20%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since DNA extraction of formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples is unreliable, it is important that blood or tissue samples be stored at autopsy of such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This can facilitate establishing a diagnosis and thereby save lives in the future </plain></SENT>
