<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in patients with hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical characteristics from 5 patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> hospitalized from January 2000 to December 2010 in our hospital were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were diagnosed with left ventricular outflow tract obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with outflow pressure gradient from 36 to 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) and left atrial size 44 - 68 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another patient was diagnosed as ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with significant right-ventricular outflow tract <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (30 mm), high pressure gradient (164 mm Hg) and enlarged right atrial (56 mm × 53 mm), there was a 17 mm × 8 mm vegetation on right-ventricular outflow tract in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures were positive for streptococcus viridans in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients, and enterococcus faecium was revealed in one aortic valve vegetation culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed 2 - 4 times for each patient, the vegetations of two patients was detected only by transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve vegetation was detected in two patients, the aortic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve vegetations</z:e> were detected in one patients, mitral and tricuspid vegetations in one patient and right ventricular outflow tract vegetation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four hemodynamically stable patients were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy, one patient received urgent surgery (replacement of the aortic and mitral valve as well as septal myectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered and follow-up (1 - 6 years) was available in 4 patients and no complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> complicating hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is the highest in patients with both outflow obstruction and marked valve insufficiency, these patients should receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy during procedures that predispose to infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
