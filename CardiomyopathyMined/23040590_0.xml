<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) in long-term survivors with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 59 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who had a potential clinical and echocardiographic follow-up period of &gt;12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LVRR was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension ≤55 mm and fractional shortening ≥25% on the last echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 patients, 38 died (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 20, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in 11, and other causes in 7), 2 underwent transplantation, and 19 survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the survivors, the LV size had significantly decreased and LV fractional shortening had significantly increased on the last echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LVRR occurred in 37% of the survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 63% of the survivors still had LV dysfunction, but the LV end-systolic dimension had decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who died or underwent transplantation, the LV size significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient who died or underwent transplantation had LVRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, &gt;60% of the long-term (&gt;12 years) survivors with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> still had LV systolic dysfunction, but the LV end-systolic dimension had decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients who died or underwent transplantation had significant LV enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LVRR, even if it is not marked, is associated with a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
