<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the mostly used chemotherapeutic drugs is the highly effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical use is limited by the dose-related and cumulative cardiotoxicity and consequent dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the etiology of this toxicity is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present review aimed to analyze the promising results regarding the effect of several types of physical exercise in cardiac tolerance of animals treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX), highlighting the importance of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-related mechanisms in the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical exercise positively modulates some important cardiac defense systems to antagonize the toxic effects caused by DOX treatment, including <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity, the overexpression of heat shock proteins and other anti-apoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An important role in this protective phenotype afforded by exercise should be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> plasticity, as related adaptations could be translated into improved cardiac function in the setting of the DOX <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
