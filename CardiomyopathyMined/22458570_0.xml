<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Ser358Leu mutation in TMEM43, encoding an inner nuclear membrane protein, has been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mechanisms of this mutation are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine the frequency of TMEM43 mutations as a cause of ARVC, we screened 11 ARVC families for mutations in TMEM43 and five desmosomal genes previously implicated in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional studies were performed in COS-7 cells transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp>, mutant, and 1:2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp>:mutant TMEM43 to determine the effect of the Ser358Leu mutation on the stability and cellular localization of TMEM43 and other nuclear envelope and desmosomal proteins, assessed by solubility assays and immunofluorescence imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was assessed of genes potentially affected by dysfunction of the nuclear lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three novel mutations in previously documented desmosomal genes, but no mutations in TMEM43, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COS-7 cells transfected with mutant TMEM43 exhibited no change in desmosomal stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stability and nuclear membrane localization of mutant TMEM43 and of lamin B and emerin were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutant TMEM43 did not alter the expression of genes located on chromosome 13, previously implicated in nuclear envelope protein mutations leading to skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutant TMEM43 exhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular localization and does not disrupt integrity and localization of other nuclear envelope and desmosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic role of TMEM43 mutations in ARVC remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
