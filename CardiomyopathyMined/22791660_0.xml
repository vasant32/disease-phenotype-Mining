<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acquired chemotherapy resistance is a major contributor to treatment failure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) phenotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> to overcome <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted by poor solubility and low bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Building upon our recently developed polymer nanoparticle of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, we synthesized a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming DOX resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype and caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOX-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, prostate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression, even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (DoxilÂ®) resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as indicated by total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A composite DOX-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> nanoparticle that overcomes both <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-based DOX chemoresistance and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity holds promise for providing lasting and safe anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
