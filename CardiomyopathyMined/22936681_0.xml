<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral cardiology centre in London, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 192 patients were mainly recruited from specialist clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anderson-Fabry disease</z:e> (AFD, n=17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, n=31), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM, n=31), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS, n=66), cardiac AL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (n=27) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI, n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those for 81 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, ECV (mean (95% CI), measured in the septum) was slightly higher in women than men (0.273 (0.264 to 0.282 vs 0.233 (0.225 to 0.244), p&lt;0.001), with no change with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In disease, the ECV of AFD was the same as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other diseases (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean ECV was the same in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, HCM and AS (0.280, 0.291, 0.276 respectively), but higher in cardiac AL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and higher again in MI (0.466 and 0.585 respectively, each p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Where ECV was elevated, correlations were found with indexed left ventricular mass, end systolic volume, ejection fraction and left atrial area in apparent disease-specific patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial ECV, assessed non-invasively in the septum with equilibrium contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance, shows gender differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and disease-specific variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ECV shows early potential to be a useful biomarker in health and disease </plain></SENT>
