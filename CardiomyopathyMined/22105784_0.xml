<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many different causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic value of common electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and nonobstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 94 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (n = 17), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> (n = 20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (n = 17), AS (n = 20), and HC (n = 20), common ECG parameters were analyzed and tested for their diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stepwise approach including the Sokolow-Lyon index, corrected QT duration, and PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II to overcome P-wave abnormalities was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A corrected QT duration &lt;440 ms in combination with a PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II &lt;40 ms was 100% sensitive and 99% specific for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>, whereas a corrected QT duration &gt;440 ms and a Sokolow-Lyon index â‰¤1.5 mV were found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 100%, respectively, for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and differentiation from HC, AS, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a novel index ([PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II multiplied by corrected QT duration]/Sokolow-Lyon index) proved to be highly diagnostic for the differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (area under the curve 0.92) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (area under the curve 0.91) by receiver operator characteristic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a combined analysis of PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II, corrected QT duration, and Sokolow-Lyon index proved highly sensitive and specific in the differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and HC compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these easy-to-assess ECG parameters may be of substantial help in the diagnostic workup of these 5 conditions </plain></SENT>
