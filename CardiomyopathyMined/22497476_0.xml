<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether treatment with ANG-II type 1 receptor blocker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> medoxomil is associated with the attenuation of cardiac myosin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) through recently established new axis of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was elicited in Lewis rats by immunisation with cardiac myosin, and 28 days after immunisation, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> medoxomil (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of ACE-2, ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi>-treated group compared with those of vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">Olmesartan</z:chebi> treatment effectively suppressed the myocardial protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of inflammatory markers in comparison to the vehicle-treated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
