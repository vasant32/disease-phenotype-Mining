<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiological pathways for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control of collagen turnover, and the pathological development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> are beginning to be understood, as are their relationships to cardiac remodelling and adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emerging non-invasive imaging techniques (echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography) may allow a clearer understanding and measurement of these processes in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results are exciting, spanning valvular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and rarer diseases such as amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, such developments and research directions are explored, including the rapid developments in cardiovascular magnetic resonance T1 mapping and its use with contrast to derive extracellular volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors present a state-of-the-art assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each modality, and distil a framework to equip the reader with an understanding of the technical issues useful for the interpretation of emerging clinical studies </plain></SENT>
