<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> were defined according to phenotypical appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now, as our understanding of the pathophysiology of the different entities classified under each of the different phenotypes improves and our knowledge of the molecular and genetic basis for these entities progresses, the traditional classifications seem oversimplistic and do not reflect current understanding of this myriad of diseases and disease processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although our knowledge of the exact basis of many of the disease processes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> is still in its infancy, it is important to have a classification system that has the ability to incorporate the coming tide of molecular and genetic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper discusses how the traditional classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has evolved due to rapid advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis for many of these clinical entities </plain></SENT>
