<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T(1) mapping is a previously validated imaging technique that can quantify the burden of global and regional interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the association between MRI T(1) mapping and subtle left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in diabetic patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV ejection fraction (EF) and no underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or regional macroscopic scar on MRI delayed enhancement were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients were compared with 19 healthy controls who were frequency matched in age, sex and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in mean LV end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index and LVEF between diabetic patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients had significantly shorter global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time (425±72 ms vs. 504±34 ms, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time and LVEF (r=0.14, P=0.32) in the diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was good correlation between global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time and global longitudinal strain (r=-0.73, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time was the strongest independent determinant of global longitudinal strain on multivariate analysis (standardized β=-0.626, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was good correlation between global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time and septal E' (r=0.54, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time was also the strongest independent determinant of septal E' (standardized β=0.432, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A shorter global contrast-enhanced myocardial T(1) time was associated with more impaired longitudinal myocardial systolic and diastolic function in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
