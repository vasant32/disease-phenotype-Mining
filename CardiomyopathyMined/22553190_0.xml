<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is equivalent to surgery regarding short and intermediate term mortality, and left main PCI has emerged as a safe and effective alternate to surgical revascularization [2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, outcomes of unprotected left main PCI in patients with severely depressed LVEF have not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with left main <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> total occlusion, multivessel CAD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, in whom complete revascularization via PCI resulted in decreased left ventricular size and improved LVEF </plain></SENT>
