<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination, blood tests and echocardiographic study were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 76 patients (43 IDCM, 33 ICM) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients were younger (p&lt;0.001) and female gender was more prevalent (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NYHA class and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients had lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) but smoked more than ICM patients (p=0.023) and had higher rates of family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (p=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was similar but resting heart rate was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients presented less frequently with peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (p=0.046 and 0.020, respectively) and showed better right ventricular function on echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QRS duration was similar between groups but only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients there was a positive correlation between QRS duration and age (r=0.619, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output was similar but functional capacity assessed by the Duke Activity Status Index was better in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> (p=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> and ICM patients received similar treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> were younger, presented lower rates of right ventricular dysfunction and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo> and had better functional capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional differences in clinical and laboratory findings exist pointing to a different patient population with diverse prognosis and potential need for individualized management </plain></SENT>
