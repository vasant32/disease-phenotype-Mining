<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since its description by Sakamoto in 1976 in Japanese patients, our understanding of this entity has evolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as the gold standard for diagnosing AHC, clinical attention must be drawn to the unique electrocardiographic features that provide the initial clues to making the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, we present a 47-year-old man with AHC who presented with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, but anomalies on his electrocardiogram went unnoticed on two clinical encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was subsequently admitted to our service and rapidly diagnosed after we observed the very classical findings in the plain twelve lead electrocardiogram done at the time of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a clinical encounter involving a patient presenting with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, special attention must be focused on the electrocardiogram to decipher the unique diagnostic features it might show </plain></SENT>
