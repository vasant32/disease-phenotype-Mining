<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) and have been associated with arterial and cardiac dysfunction and reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Troponin T (cTnT) is released from cardiac myocytes under conditions of stress and is predictive of mortality across a range of renal functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of this biomarker was formerly limited by the lower limit of assay detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The introduction of a high-sensitivity assay has enabled more detailed study of myocyte stress below the previous limit of detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied the association of mediators of CKD-MBD with arterial stiffness and also of these mediators and arterial stiffness with myocardial damage in patients with CKD stages 3-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OPG and FGF-23 were measured in 200 CKD stages 3-4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>cTnT was measured using a high-sensitivity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness was assessed using aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 69 ± 11 years, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 151 ± 22/81 ± 11 mmHg and renal function was 33 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OPG, FGF-23, high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) and APWV <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlated with renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, OPG and age remained independently associated with aortic stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OPG and FGF-23 were independently associated with hs-cTnT in addition to other non-traditional risk factors (Model R(2) = 0.596) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have shown that changes in bone mediators and phosphate metabolism induced by CKD are independently associated with vascular and cardiomyocyte dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that cardiac dysfunction may be specifically associated with such abnormalities in addition to recognized increases in vascular stiffness </plain></SENT>
