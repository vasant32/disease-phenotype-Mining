<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While Ca(2+) regulation has been extensively studied, little is known about the dynamics of individual regulatory units and structural changes of individual tropomyosin molecules in relation to their mechanical properties, and how these factors are altered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this hypothesis paper, we explore how various experimental and analytical approaches could broaden our understanding of the cooperative regulation of cardiac contraction in health and disease </plain></SENT>
