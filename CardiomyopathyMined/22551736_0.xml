<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Residual platelet reactivity can be also affected by GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relation between response to dual antiplatelet therapy and GC in diabetics with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> treated with primary coronary angioplasty (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty diabetic patients were prospectively enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet reactivity (whole blood aggregation and phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>-stimulated phosphoprotein, VASP) were assessed serially before and 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after the PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;8.5 mmol/L on admission was an independent predictor of a impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> response measured with platelet reactivity index (PRI) &gt;50% on admission (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.4-17.7, p&lt;0.02) and 24 hours after PCI (OR 13.1, 95% CI 3.4-28.1, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and glycemia &gt;8.5 mmol/L on admission is related to a poorer response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no interaction between glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level or glycemia on admission and platelet reactivity measured with collagen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> or thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-induced aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies of the role of GC in the efficacy of antiplatelet agents are warranted </plain></SENT>
