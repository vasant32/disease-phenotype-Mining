<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare clinical presentation, in-hospital course, and long-term outcomes in TTC female patients with on-admission ST-segment elevation and anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive TTC patients with on-admission ST-segment elevation were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a propensity score, a matching <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> control group was put together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for a mean 1,002 ± 552 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cardiac events were defined as TTC recurrence, MI recurrence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> requiring hospitalisation, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty one TTC patients were enrolled, including 29 women with on-admission ST-segment elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 46 STEMI women with left anterior descending occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ECG at presentation showed greater ST- -segment elevation (6.0 ± 1.6 vs 2.0 ± 1.2 mm, p &lt; 0.01) in the control <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients than in the TTC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, baseline CK-MB (16.2 ± 20.6 vs 66.0 ± 125.2 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.01) and troponin-I levels (2.99 ± 5.36 vs 42.70 ± 64.79 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed higher follow-up ejection fraction in the TTC than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> group (57.0 ± 8.0 vs 49.5 ± 8.8%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, there was no significant difference in the major adverse cardiac events rate between the TTC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> groups (-24.1% vs 41.3%, p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some diversity in ECG, laboratory, and ECHO parameters, none of these patterns alone can reliably distinguish TTC from MI in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TTC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> females have similar in-hospital and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
