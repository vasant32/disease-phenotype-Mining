<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Well known predictors of CAC are age, gender, and the classical atherogenic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAC is associated with atherosclerotic plaque burden, but it is still elusive if <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-relevant cytokines and chemokines are also associated with CAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a clinical study among 455 consecutive individuals who underwent coronary calcium assessment performed by MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before MDCT, blood was drawn and subsequently analyzed for 20 different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-relevant cytokines and chemokines using a Luminex-laser-based fluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using univariate analyses, CAC patients revealed significantly higher levels of the chemokines IP-10 (P=0.047) and eotaxin (P=0.031) as compared to non-CAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses using common thresholds for calcium burden, the three cytokines interleukin-6 (P=0.028), interleukin-8 (P=0.009), and interleukin-13 (P=0.024) were associated with high coronary calcium levels after adjustment for classical variables and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large group of individuals with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and a low to intermediate likelihood for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of IL-8 and IL-13 were predictive for distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support a specific role of these cytokines in coronary calcification </plain></SENT>
