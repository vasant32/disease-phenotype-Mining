<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Color flow Doppler imaging was performed from the apical long-axis view in 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and 58 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doppler flow data obtained during IVC were analyzed offline with vector flow mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A large vortex was formed from the LV inflow toward the outflow during IVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the area of the vortex was sustained, but the flow volume decreased significantly during IVC (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant apex-to-base flow velocity gradient was shown along the outflow axis on aortic valve opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, both the area and flow volume of the vortex decreased more severely during IVC in the patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apex-to-base flow velocity gradient along the outflow axis disappeared and a reversed velocity gradient was observed at the basal-mid level on aortic valve opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, a decreased LV ejection fraction was the only independent predictor of the percentage decrease in area of the vortex during the IVC (P &lt; 0.001), and a larger QRS width (P = 0.028) and LV end-systolic long diameter (P = 0.002) were independent predictors of the percentage decrease in flow volume of the vortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vortex across the LV inflow-outflow region during IVC facilitates the ejection of blood during early systole, and an unsustained vortex may be associated with impaired cardiac function </plain></SENT>
