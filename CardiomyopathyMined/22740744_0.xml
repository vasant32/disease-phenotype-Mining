<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is a rare event that is associated with high mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis includes coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>, coronary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, vascular spasm, and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our evaluation of 2 cases over a 5-year time period has led to a hypothesis that peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is an immune-mediated event secondary to coronary endothelial sensitization by fetal antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our patients, we supplemented standard medical therapy with immunotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present our most recent case-that of a 29-year-old black woman (gravida V, para IV), 2 weeks postpartum with no relevant medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She presented with a 1-week history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial electrocardiographic and cardiac biomarkers were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006673'>reduced systolic function</z:hpo> with inferior-wall hypokinesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed diffuse disease with occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery not amenable to revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We were successful in treating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> without the use of catheter-based interventions, by modifying the immunologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases do not make a protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Yet we believe that this case and our earlier case lend credence to the hypothesis that peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> arises from sensitization by fetal antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This concept and the immune-modifying treatment protocol that we propose might also assist in understanding and treating other inflammatory-<z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of this warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
