<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Left atrial ablation has become more commonplace with the advent of catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of transseptal sheaths have been produced to enhance safe and efficient catheter manipulation in the left atrium (LA) for these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of the sheaths have been subject to recall due to partial or complete detachment of its radiopaque tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 46 year-old female diagnosed with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that presented with atypical left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During electrophysiologic study, a Swartz braided SL1 (SL-1) transseptal sheath was used to introduce the ablation catheter to the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During left atrial mapping, the radiopaque tip of the sheath detached from the rest of the sheath and was seen floating in the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After exchanging the SL-1 sheath with a deflectable sheath, the detached segment was retrieved out of the LA and eventually out of the vascular system using an angioplasty balloon advanced over a wire and inflated distal to the lumen of the detached tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The root cause of this malfunction was found to be lack of a secondary bonding process that these sheaths generally undergo during the manufacturing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a left atrial ablation procedure where a novel percutaneous method was able to successfully retrieve the detached tip of a transseptal sheath from the vascular system, thereby avoiding a potential catastrophic complication or thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method may be useful in other cases where similar circumstances may present </plain></SENT>
