<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to create a prospective registry of PPCM patients with the assistance of the internet and identify clinical factors predictive of ejection fraction (EF) recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with PPCM were identified by novel web-based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized as recovered (EF&gt;50) or nonrecovered (EF&lt;50) and compared on the basis of demographic and clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five subjects met criteria for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant association between diagnosis during third trimester and persistent systolic dysfunction (25% vs. 4.7%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and breastfeeding were significantly associated with EF recovery (48.8% vs. 16.7%, p=0.046, and 39.5% vs. 8.3%, p=0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EF normalization occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with EF(1) ≥ 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of gHTN, EF ≥ 35% at diagnosis, breastfeeding, and postpartum diagnosis were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with recovery of systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Internet recruitment may be a valuable tool for studying PPCM </plain></SENT>
