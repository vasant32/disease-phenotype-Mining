<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding the precise distribution of the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) in apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is important because the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can mimic an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to quantify the severity and distribution of RWMA in ABS, compare it to anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, and correlate with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RWMA (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> = 1, hypokinetic = 2, akinetic = 3) was quantified from the biplane left ventriculogram using a nine-segment model in 95 ABS and 17 anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients at the time of their presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional wall motion score index (RWMSI) was higher in ABS [2.1 (1.9, 2.1)] compared to anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> [2.0 (1.8, 2.0)], P = 0.024] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region that most clearly differentiated ABS from anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> was the posterolateral segment (sensitivity 81% and specificity 100%) which was hypocontractile in 81% of ABS, but none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RWMSI in ABS had a modest positive correlation with the troponin T levels (r = 0.23, P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ABS with ST-segment elevation had the highest RWMSI [2.1(2.0, 2.2)], while those with non specific changes had the lowest [1.9 (1.8, 2.1)] (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with ABS have greater and more diffuse RWMA compared to anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of systolic dysfunction in the posterolateral segment in the left anterior oblique projection of the left ventriculogram most accurately distinguishes ABS from an anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> highlighting the utility of biplane angiography for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The severity of RWMA correlates with the extent of troponin release and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
