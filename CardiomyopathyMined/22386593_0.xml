<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the first, as far as is known, cumulative experience of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> for inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, including familial hypertrophic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, cardioencephalomyopathy and Emery-Dreifuss <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 PGD cycles were performed, resulting in transfer in 15 of them, which yielded nine unaffected pregnancies and the births of seven disease- or disease predisposition-free children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) is currently an established clinical procedure in assisted reproduction and genetic practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its application has been expanding beyond traditional indications of prenatal diagnosis and currently includes common disorders with genetic predisposition, such as inherited forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This applies also to the diseases with no current prospect of treatment, which may manifest despite presymptomatic diagnosis and follow up, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> may provide the only relief for the at-risk couples to reproduce </plain></SENT>
