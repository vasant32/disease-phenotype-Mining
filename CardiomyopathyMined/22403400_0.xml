<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By atomic force microscopy, we demonstrated filament formation defects of desmin mutants, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the pathogenesis of this disease, it is essential to analyze desmin filament structures under conditions in which both healthy and mutant desmin are expressed at equimolar levels mimicking an in vivo situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied dual color photoactivation localization microscopy using photoactivatable fluorescent proteins genetically fused to desmin and characterized the heterozygous status in living cells lacking endogenous desmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer to unravel short distance structural patterns of desmin mutants in filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the first time, we present consistent high resolution data on the structural effects of five heterozygous desmin mutations on filament formation in vitro and in living cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results may contribute to the molecular understanding of the pathological filament formation defects of heterozygous DES mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
