<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) black-blood technique has been used to visualize myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and thus to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) groups have reported variable image quality, and hence the diagnostic value of STIR in routine clinical practice has been put into question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyze image quality and diagnostic performance of STIR using a set of pulse sequence parameters dedicated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> detection, and to discuss possible factors that influence image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that STIR imaging is an accurate and robust way of detecting myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in non-selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> underwent CMR (day 4.5, +/- 1.6) including STIR for the assessment of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) for quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty of these patients underwent a follow-up CMR at approximately six months (195 +/- 39 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both STIR and LGE images were evaluated separately on a segmental basis for image quality as well as for presence and extent of myocardial hyper-intensity, with both visual and semi-quantitative (threshold-based) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LGE was used as a reference standard for localization and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>) or scar (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Image quality of STIR images was rated as diagnostic in 99.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, the sensitivity and specificity of STIR to detect infarcted segments on visual assessment was 95% and 78% respectively, and on semi-quantitative assessment was 99% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>STIR differentiated acutely from chronically infarcted segments with a sensitivity of 95% by both methods and with a specificity of 99% by visual assessment and 97% by semi-quantitative assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The extent of hyper-intense areas on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> STIR images was 85% larger than those on LGE images, with a larger myocardial salvage index in reperfused than in non-reperfused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STIR with appropriate pulse sequence settings is accurate in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MI with both visual and semi-quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Due to its unique technical characteristics, STIR should be regarded as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-weighted rather than a purely T2-weighted technique </plain></SENT>
