<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous animal models of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> exist and the Doberman pinscher dog is one of the most commonly reported canine breeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the Doberman pinscher dog using a genome-wide association study for a genetic alteration(s) associated with the development of this disease in this canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association analysis identified an area of statistical significance on canine chromosome 14 (p(raw) = 9.999e-05 corrected for genome-wide significance), fine-mapping of additional SNPs flanking this region localized a signal to 23,774,190-23,781,919 (p = 0.001) and DNA sequencing identified a 16-base pair deletion in the 5' donor splice site of intron 10 of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene in affected dogs (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of myocardium from affected dogs demonstrated disorganization of the Z line, mild to moderate T tubule and <z:mp ids='MP_0004089'>sarcoplasmic reticulum dilation</z:mp>, marked pleomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> alterations with megamitochondria, scattered mitochondria with whorling and vacuolization and mild aggregates of lipofuscin granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report the identification of a splice site deletion in the PDK4 gene that is associated with the development of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the Doberman pinscher dog </plain></SENT>
