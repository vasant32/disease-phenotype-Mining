<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genetic and epigenetic factors underlying the variable penetrance of homoplasmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA mutations are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a 16-year-old patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> harboring a homoplasmic m.4277T&gt;C mutation in the mt-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29174">tRNA(Ile)</z:chebi> (MTTI) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle showed multiple respiratory chain enzyme abnormalities and a decreased steady-state level of the mutated mt-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29174">tRNA(Ile)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmitochondrial cybrids grown on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> medium demonstrated a functional effect of this mutation on cell viability, confirming pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were reproduced in transmitochondrial cybrids, harboring a previously described homoplasmic m.4300A&gt;G MTTI mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic role of the m.4277T&gt;C mutation may be ascribed to misfolding of the mt-tRNA molecule, as demonstrated by the altered electrophoretic migration of the mutated mt-tRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, structure and sequence analyses suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> at position 4277 of mt-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29174">tRNA(Ile)</z:chebi> is involved in a conserved tertiary interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> at position 4306 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mutation showed variable penetrance within family members, with skeletal muscle from the patient's clinically unaffected mother demonstrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> muscle respiratory chain activities and steady-state levels of mt-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29174">tRNA(Ile)</z:chebi>, while homoplasmic for the m.4277T&gt;C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32615">isoleucyl</z:chebi>-tRNA synthetase revealed significantly higher expression levels in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts of the unaffected mother when compared with the proband, while the transient over-expression of the IARS2 gene in patient transmitochondrial cybrids improved cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first observation that constitutively high levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2651">aminoacyl-tRNA</z:chebi> synthetases (aaRSs) in human tissues prevent the phenotypic expression of a homoplasmic mt-tRNA point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings extend previous observations on aaRSs therapeutic effects in yeast and human </plain></SENT>
