<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to determine risk factors for maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in pregnancy complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The subjects were 29 patients diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> before conception or during the first 7 months of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was defined as left ventricle end-diastolic dimension (LVDd)≥48 mm and/or fractional shortening (%FS)≤30% on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed until at least 1 year after delivery and were categorized into a poor prognosis group (n=6; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or end stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV) and a good prognosis group (n=23; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was initially diagnosed during pregnancy in 6/6 and 8/23 patients in the poor and good prognosis groups, respectively (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The %FS of the first test during pregnancy was 17.5±6.2 and 27.4±9.3% in the respective groups (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight abortion cases with %FS 15.2±3.1%, %FS, cardiac function and NYHA class were maintained until 20 months after abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between LVDd and maternal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> during pregnancy and decreased %FS are risk factors for a poor maternal outcome in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abortion prevents further deterioration of cardiac function in patients with a very low %FS </plain></SENT>
