<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, estimates of the associated risk of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> have been derived from short-term studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to ascertain the long-term risk of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> therapy for multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2002 and 2010, 50 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> at a single centre using a standard protocol (12 mg/m(2) body surface area monthly for 6 months as tolerated to a maximum of 72 mg/m(2) body surface area) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up haematologic and echocardiographic data were collected in March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (30%) were excluded from analysis either because of lack of follow-up data, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to non-cardiac and non-haematologic causes, or comorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 35 patients (70%) were followed for a median of 75 months (range: 9-103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> dose given was 72 mg/m(2) body surface area (range: 24-123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, no patients had developed therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered an asymptomatic drop in left ventricular ejection fraction from 55 to 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series of patients followed for up to 8.5 years suggests that the risk of either therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> therapy for multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> is low when patients are treated within standard protocol </plain></SENT>
