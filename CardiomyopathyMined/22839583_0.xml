<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1993 to 2011 we examined 176 children - 117 boys (66,5%) and 59 girls (33,5%) - with manifesting type of WPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at first examination was 12.5+/-3.2 ( 0.1 18 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 66.5% of children WPW phenomenon was present in the age from 10 to 18  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hundred fifty nine children (104 [65.4%] boys and 55 [34.6%] girls) were followed up for 0.5-17 years (mean 7.4+/-4.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up spontaneous attacs of atrioventricular reciprocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> appeared in 13 children (8.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-13.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous disappearance of signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular pre-excitation</z:hpo> on electrocardiogram and transition to intermittent form of WPW were registered in 14(8.8%, 95%CI 4.9-14.3%) and 12 children (7.5%, 95% CI 3.9-12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short lasting syncopal states were observed in 15 children (8.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 of them <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with high rate of venricular rhytm was induced during transesophageal electrophysiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two (1.3%) children had history of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one of them WPW phenomenon was combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This child died at the age of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One (0.6%) boy with WPW phenomenon died suddenly in 3 years after initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, children with WPW phenomenon are at risk of development of life threatening states and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stratification of risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> is necessary at examination of such children </plain></SENT>
