<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As each human heart is uniquely dependent upon mitochondria to generate massive amounts of ATP that fuel its approximately 38million contractions per year, it seems odd that cardiac myocytes are the sole exception to the general rule that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dynamism is important to function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, I briefly review the mechanisms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion and fission and examine current data that dispel the previous notion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion is dispensable in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rare and generally overlooked examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> linked either to naturally-occurring mutations or to experimentally-induced mutagenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion/fission genes are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New findings from genetically targeted Drosophila and mouse models wherein <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fusion deficiency has specifically been induced in cardiac myocytes are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> dynamics and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
