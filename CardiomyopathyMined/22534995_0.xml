<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to identify echocardiographic parameters associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> in CC and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> of other etiologies, such as non-CC (NCC), and to compare pulmonary venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between the two entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 130 consecutive patients with CC and NCC, with similar echocardiographic characteristics, were assessed using Doppler echocardiography and chest radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary venous vessel abnormalities were graded using a previously described <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> score, and this score was compared with Doppler echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NCC patients were older than CC patients (62.4 ± 13.5 × 47.8 ± 11.2, p = 0.00), and there were more male subjects in the CC group (66.2% × 58.5%, p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 41 patients in the CC group (63.1%) and in 63 (96.9%) in the NCC group (p = 0.0), the mean lung <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> score being 3.2 ± 2.3 and 5.9 ± 2.6 (p = 0.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On linear regression multivariate analysis, the E/e' ratio (β = 0.13; p = 0.0), LV diastolic diameter (β = 0.06; p = 0.06), left atrial diameter (β = 0.51; p = 0.08), and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic diameter (β = 0.02; p = 0.48) were the variables that correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>Pulmonary congestion</z:mp> was less significant in patients with CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of LV of systolic and diastolic dysfunction and the RV diameter correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The E/e' ratio was the hallmark of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
