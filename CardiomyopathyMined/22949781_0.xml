<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine years earlier, he had been diagnosed with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and nonsustainable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time, he had received a single-chamber implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, which was upgraded to a dual-chamber implanted cardioverter-defibrillator 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the course of the current admission, routine device interrogation during exchange of the patient's implanted cardioverter-defibrillator generator revealed 150 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in the preceding 7 months, 137 of which had been successfully treated by antitachycardia pacing therapy without shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings show the remarkable effectiveness of antitachycar-dia pacing in terminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> while preventing the delivery of shocks, minimizing patient discomfort, and avoiding implanted cardioverter-defibrillator battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
