<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise pathophysiology of these syndromes remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a unique series of patients with both ABS and PRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective study of 224 consecutive patients diagnosed with ABS between 2002 and 2010, 6 (2.7%) were also diagnosed with PRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were female with a mean age of 63.7 ± 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preceding medical comorbidities and physical stress triggers that precipitated ABS and PRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean peak troponin T levels and left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation were 0.47 ± 0.48 mg/dL and 31.5 ± 8.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristic left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (regional wall motion score index 2.22 ± 0.37) were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was significant for vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, predominantly in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered left ventricular (ejection fraction at follow-up 60.2 ± 6.0%) and neurologic function with supportive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had recurrence of ABS and 1 of PRES during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ABS and PRES can occur simultaneously during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with ABS who develop neurologic dysfunction should be evaluated for PRES and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because transient sympathetic overactivity and microvascular dysfunction have been observed in both reversible syndromes, we speculate that they may represent the shared pathophysiologic mechanism </plain></SENT>
