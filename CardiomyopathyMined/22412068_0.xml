<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this evaluation were to validate the prognostic value of GLS as a new index of LV systolic function in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to determine the incremental value of GLS to predict long-term outcome over other strong and well-established prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1060 patients underwent baseline clinical evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 66.9 years (interquartile range, 58.4, 74.2 years); 739 (70%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration for the entire patient population was 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 270 patients died and 309 patients reached the combined end point (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with survivors, patients who died (270, [25%]) had larger LV volumes (P&lt;0.05), lower LV ejection fraction (P=0.004), higher wall motion score index (P=0.001), and greater impairment of LV GLS (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After dichotomizing the population on the basis of the median value of LV GLS (-11.5%), patients with an LV GLS ≤-11.5% had superior outcome compared with patients with an LV GLS &gt;-11.5% (log-rank χ(2), 13.86 and 14.16 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and combined end point, respectively, P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, GLS was independently related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (hazard ratio per 5% increase, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.15; P&lt;0.001) and combined end point (1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.04; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of LV GLS with speckle-tracking echocardiography is significantly related to long-term outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
