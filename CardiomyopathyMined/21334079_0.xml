<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: IL-6 is known to be an important mediator in immune response and is now suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of IL-6 in β(1)-adrenergic receptor induced autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice and fifty-one <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> C57BL/6J (WT) mice were immunized with a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the β(1) (β(1)AR ECII) at 0, 1, 5, 9, 13 weeks and observed until 25 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another forty-one WT mice and twenty IL-6(-/-) mice were used as controls receiving vehicle in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with IL-6(-/-) immunized and control mice, WT immunized mice showed increased end-systolic left ventricular dimension and end-diastolic left ventricular dimension as well as decreased fractional shortening and circumferential fiber shortening in the end of the experiment, which was accompanied by significantly increased antibody level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoding for β(1)-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2), B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) and β(1) adrenergic receptor (Adrb1) in heart tissues from WT immunized group were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation among end-diastolic left ventricular dimension, autoantibody titer and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of BNP, Adrb1 and GRK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that immunization with β1AR ECII was unable to induce an early stage phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in IL-6(-/-) mice, being different from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was observed, suggesting that IL-6 plays a key role in the regulation of β(1)AR induced autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> possibly through its enhanced antibody production </plain></SENT>
