<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in GH as an etiologic factor in many cardiovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>Acromegaly</z:hpo>, a state of endogenous GH excess, results in <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> and decreased cardiac performance with increased cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional insight into the role of excess GH on the cardiovascular system has been gained from data collected in athletes doping with GH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, GH deficiency is associated with increased mortality, possibly from the associated increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, further research is required to clarify the benefit of GH treatment in both deficient states and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
