<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">Alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> (ALA), a naturally occurring compound, exerts powerful protective effects in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in protecting against Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the effects of ALA on cardiac dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (MOS), extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and interrelated signaling pathways in a diabetic rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced in rats by I.V. injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) at 45 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> groups with or without ALA treatment, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> groups with or without ALA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were carried out 11 weeks after induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization was performed to evaluate cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative biochemical parameters were measured by spectophotometeric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extracellular matrix content (total collagen, type I and III collagen) was assessed by staining with Sirius Red </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gelatinolytic activity of Pro- and active matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels were analyzed by a zymogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac fibroblasts differentiation to myofibroblasts was evaluated by Western blot measuring smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Key components of underlying signaling pathways including the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK and ERK were also assayed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was successfully induced by the injection of STZ as evidenced by abnormal heart mass and cardiac function, as well as the imbalance of ECM homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After administration of ALA, left ventricular dysfunction greatly improved; interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> also notably ameliorated indicated by decreased collagen deposition, ECM synthesis as well as enhanced ECM degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To further assess the underlying mechanism of improved <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> by ALA, redox status and cardiac remodeling associated signaling pathway components were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It was shown that redox homeostasis was disturbed and MAPK signaling pathway components activated in STZ-induced <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While ALA treatment favorably shifted redox homeostasis and suppressed JNK and p38 MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results, coupled with the excellent safety and tolerability profile of ALA in humans, demonstrate that ALA may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> by attenuating MOS, ECM remodeling and JNK, p38 MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
