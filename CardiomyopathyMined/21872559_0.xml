<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated local voltage potentials indicating conduction impairment and block in the sinus beats preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>) originating in the ventricular outflow tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that impairment of impulse conduction would also lead to changes in the contractile performance of sinus beats preceding ventricular ectopy using Tissue Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> were examined in the apical 4-chamber view with a frame rate of 150 Hz (GE VIVID VII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had no structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 5 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, 2 had arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ectopy originated in the ventricular outflow tracts in 15 patients and in the left ventricle 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the patients underwent radiofrequency ablation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tissue Doppler imaging demonstrated a highly statistically significant decrease in myocardial performance in the last sinus beat before the <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPB</z:mp> compared to earlier sinus beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ejection time (time to peak end-systolic contraction) and peak systolic velocity shortened significantly (P &lt;.001 for both) with a subsequent reduction in systolic shortening (end-systolic displacement; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ventricular ectopy is preceded by a significant decrease in myocardial performance in the last sinus beat preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> as observed in consecutive patients with a broad variety of heart conditions pointing to a mutual underlying electrical mechanism (ie, localized conduction block confined to an area surrounding the ectopic pacemaker) </plain></SENT>
