<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) are a promising source of cells for regenerating myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several issues, especially the large-scale preparation of hiPS-CMs and elimination of undifferentiated iPS cells, must be resolved before hiPS cells can be used clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell-sheet technique is one of the useful methods for transplanting large numbers of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that hiPS-CM-sheet transplantation would be feasible, safe, and therapeutically effective for the treatment of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Human iPS cells were established by infecting human dermal fibroblasts with a retrovirus carrying Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyogenic differentiation was induced by WNT signaling molecules, yielding hiPS-CMs that were almost 90% positive for Î±-actinin, Nkx2.5, and cardiac troponin T. hiPS-CM sheets were created using thermoresponsive dishes and transplanted over the myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a porcine model of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> induced by ameroid constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n=6 for the iPS group receiving sheet transplantation and the sham-operated group; both groups received tacrolimus daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantation significantly improved cardiac performance and attenuated left ventricular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hiPS-CMs were detectable 8 weeks after transplantation, but very few survived long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> formation was observed in animals that received hiPS-CM sheets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The culture system used yields a large number of highly pure hiPS-CMs, and hiPS-CM sheets could improve cardiac function after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This newly developed culture system and the hiPS-CM sheets may provide a basis for the clinical use of hiPS cells in cardiac regeneration therapy </plain></SENT>
