<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The treatment of severe biventricular (BV) contractile failure using mechanical circulatory support is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed our center's results following implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organ available at time of BVAD implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BV failure (group 1), whereas the other 24 suffered from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indication for BVAD implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degree of end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37±17 years) than those in group 2 (51±12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of support in group 1 was 137±109 days, and 65±61 days in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 1, 33% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42%) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> group were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 1's mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2 (13% vs 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year compared with four in group 2 (73% vs 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By contrast, BVAD implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BV failure without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, even if they are in cardiogenic shock upon admission </plain></SENT>
