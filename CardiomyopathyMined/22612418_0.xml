<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the Ren-2 rat model, we sought to investigate the effect of FT23 on the structural and functional changes associated with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous Ren-2 rats were rendered diabetic with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> by tail vein injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were then treated with FT23 (200 mg/kg per day by gavage twice daily) or vehicle from Week 8 to Week 16 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed to assess heart function before the rats were killed and their hearts collected for histological and molecular biological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antifibrotic effect of FT23 was compared with that of tranilast in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts when stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (5 ng/mL) at 30, 50 and 100 umol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FT23 exhibited greater inhibition of TGF-β-induced collagen production in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, as measured by a [(3) H]-proline incorporation assay, compared with its parental compound tranilast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, FT23 significantly attenuated the <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weight</z:mp> : bodyweight ratio in FT23-treated diabetic Ren-2 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction, as measured by mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio and MV deceleration time, was also significantly attenuated by FT23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Picrosirius red-stained heart sections revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> in the diabetic rats was reduced by FT23 compared with that in vehicle-treated rats, with a concomitant reduction in collagen I immunostaining and infiltration of macrophages, as demonstrated by ED1 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that FT23 inhibits the activity of TGF-β and attenuates structural and functional manifestations of diastolic dysfunction observed in a model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
