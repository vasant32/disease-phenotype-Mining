<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 14 cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenoma</z:hpo> complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, treated with resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pituitary tumor</z:e>, in <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> General Hospital, from 2005 to 2011, were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of cardiac function were made in these patients before and after the surgery, also with the postoperative recovery status, using echocardiography and other noninvasive detection means to detect the growth hormone (GH), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), septal thickness (ST), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pituitary tumor</z:e>, the LVEDD, ST, LVPWT, LVEF levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly better than that before the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before the surgery the GH, ST, LVPWT, LVEF levels were 93.89 µg/L, 11.13 mm, 43.92% and 10.53 mm, while those after the surgery were 5.16 µg/L, 10.64 mm, 49.28% and 8.87 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference of the GH level before and after the surgery was correlated with the difference of ST, LVEDD and LVEF in a linear manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pituitary tumor</z:e> can significantly improve the cardiac function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenoma</z:hpo> complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and the cardiac function improving level is correlated with the difference of GH levels before and after the surgery </plain></SENT>
