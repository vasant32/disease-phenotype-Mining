<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of short-term exercise training on cardiac function and metabolism during rest and physical exercise in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n=15, age 58±2 years, NYHA class I-III) were studied before and after 8 weeks of cycle exercise for 20 min, five times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiac volumes, function and high energy phosphate metabolism were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance during rest and 7 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> physical exercise (leg-raising) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, average left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 38±3%, which did not alter during 7 min of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks of home exercise training, there was a 16% improvement in resting LVEF to 44±3% (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Training caused a further 20% improvement in LVEF (p&lt;0.05) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> physical exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between subjects' baseline level of exercise and change in LVEF (r=-0.67, p&lt;0.05), with sedentary patients having the greatest improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP ratio did not change during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> physical exercise or after exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise training improves resting LVEF and LVEF with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> physical exercise with sedentary patients having the greatest improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in cardiac PCr to ATP, before or after exercise training, suggesting that the improved cardiac function was not caused by improved energetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, peripheral factors likely underlie the improved cardiac function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> after short-term exercise </plain></SENT>
