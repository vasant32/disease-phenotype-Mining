<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aims and objectives.  The aim of this study was to measure quality of life (QoL) in asymptomatic children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) before and after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Background.  <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a disease with a 50% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children at risk for serious complications can be diagnosed early with family screening, but before embarking on a screening programme, it is important to evaluate the psychosocial consequences of such screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design.  Prospective case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods.  Quality of life was measured using a questionnaire by Lindström incorporating both objective and subjective aspects of the three spheres: external, interpersonal and personal, before and two years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 13 children/adolescents (11 boys), median age 11 (5-18) years, with HCM diagnosed at family screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> filled out a questionnaire before diagnosis and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>41 healthy children/adolescents (22 boys), median age 11 (2-19) years with a first-degree relative diagnosed with HCM served as controls; 15/41 also completed follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results.  The total QoL score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spheres was similar in both groups at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the interpersonal sphere, it was more common that children diagnosed with HCM had no siblings both at baseline (p = 0·002) and follow-up (p = 0·005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The family situation, social support and life events were unchanged from baseline to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children with HCM had significantly more psychosomatic symptoms compared with controls at baseline (p &lt; 0·05) but not at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Self-esteem, peer acceptance and satisfaction with school were unchanged and similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion.  Family screening for HCM does not appear to negatively influence QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Relevance to clinical practice.  This study indicates that family screening of asymptomatic children and adolescents had no significant detrimental effects on QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the benefits of finding symptomatic individuals at risk for serious complications outweigh concerns about screening asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
