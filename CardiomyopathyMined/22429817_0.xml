<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the cardio-protective effects and potential mechanisms of fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, on diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were investigated in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was induced by a single tail vein injection of 60 mg/kg STZ, rats were administered long-term fasudil or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> as a control over a four-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, fasudil treatment significantly protected against STZ-induced hemodynamic, histopathologic changes and decreased serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fasudil significantly down-regulated ROCK I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and ROCK activity, reduced cardiac collagen deposition, and decreased the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, fasudil potently elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity and suppressed the extent of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in sera and hearts of diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that long-term treatment with fasudil could improve cardiac dysfunction, attenuate myocardial injury and prevent pathological changes in a rat model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects could be attributed to regulation of antioxidative activities, suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and subsequent cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results may help to expand the clinical application of fasudil for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
