<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of benznidazole on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> cardiac prognosis using an experimental dog model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 28 dogs were divided into three groups: 10 were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and treated benznidazole during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, 10 were infected but untreated, and 8 were non-infected/healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trypanocidal efficacy was measured by parasite kDNA detection in blood and cardiac tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of benznidazole in ameliorating the cardiac systolic function were evaluated by echodopplercardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The benznidazole initially induced a potent suppression of parasitaemia in treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 12 months post-treatment, the parasite kDNA detections were similar between infected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the baseline echocardiographic parameters there was no variation among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 1 month post-treatment there was no significant difference among healthy and infected animals with regard to systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months post-treatment, an increase in cardiac chamber size related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> was detected among treated and untreated animals, but not in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in spite of both groups of infected animals developing a decrease in their systolic cardiac function, this decline was slightly less in the treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î± and interleukin-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytokine profiles were similar between infected animal groups and correlated with alterations in cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The temporary suppression of the T. cruzi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection induced</z:e> by benznidazole treatment was efficient in reducing systolic cardiac function alterations, but not in preventing the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
