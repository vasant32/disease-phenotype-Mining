<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While awaiting transplantation, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> decompensated to such a degree that left ventricular assist device support was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He did well on device support until a pump-pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6827">methicillin</z:chebi>-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci) developed at 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At that time, echocardiograms showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart size and an ejection fraction of 0.45 to 0.49 without pump support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pump was, therefore, explanted emergently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient has remained clinically stable with preserved ventricular function nearly 13 years after the explantation procedure </plain></SENT>
