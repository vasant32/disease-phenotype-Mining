<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and the mechanisms involved in the development of cardiac and digestive forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is growing evidence that differences in susceptibility in endemic areas may be attributable to host genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this overview was to analyze the genetic susceptibility to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e>, particularly that of single nucleotide polymorphisms of cytokine genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature was conducted on the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The search strategy included using the following terms: "Cytokines", "Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms" and "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas Disease</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After screening 25 citations from the databases, 19 studies were selected for the overview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A critical analysis of the data presented in the articles suggests that genetic susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is highly influenced by the complexity of the immune response of the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies based on other populations where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> is endemic (with distinct ethnic and genetic backgrounds) need to be conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These should use a large sample population so as to establish what cytokine genes are involved in susceptibility to and/or progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
