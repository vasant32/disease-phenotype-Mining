<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo>, which developed after the implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in a 31-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LVAD is an accepted bridging treatment to heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the patient under general anesthesia, we made landmarks around the LVAD and a drive-line to prevent injury by trocar insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first port was inserted in the umbilicus and because the subxyphoid space was occupied, the second trocar was inserted in the left flank and the other two trocars were inserted in the right subcostal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation time was 160 min and the estimated blood loss was 430 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had an uneventful postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, concomitant cholecystectomy should be considered when installing an LVAD system if the patient has biliary abnormalities </plain></SENT>
