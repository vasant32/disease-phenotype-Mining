<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The utility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> in the clinic is compromised by the risk of cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been calculated that approximately 10% of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> or its derivatives will develop cardiac complications up to 10 years after the cessation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> has been established as the primary cause of cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, interventions reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> have not been successful at reducing the incidence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New insights into the cardiomyocyte response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> demonstrate that underlying differences between in vitro and in vivo toxicities may modulate the response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals and related compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has led to potentially new uses for pre-existing drugs and new avenues of exploration to find better pharmacotherapies and interventions for the prevention of cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, much work still must be done to validate the clinical utility of these new approaches and proposed mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, the authors have reviewed the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced cardiotoxicity and propose potential pharmacological interventions and treatment options to prevent or reverse this specific type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
