<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize morphometric features, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in Maine Coon cats with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body weight, body condition score (BCS), head length and width, and abdominal circumference were measured in Maine Coon cats &gt;2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and thoracic radiography (for measurement of humerus length, and fourth and twelfth vertebrae length) were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected for biochemistry profile, DNA testing, insulin and IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 63 cats had HCM [myosin binding protein C (MYBPC)(+), n = 3 and MYBPC(-), n = 13] and 47/63 were echocardiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (MYBPC(+), n = 17 and MYBPC(-), n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in any measured parameter between MYBPC(+) and MYBPC(-) cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cats with HCM were significantly older (P &lt; 0.001), heavier (P = 0.006), more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (P = 0.008), and had longer humeri (P = 0.02) compared with the HCM(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cats with HCM also had higher serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.01), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and IGF-1 (P = 0.01) concentrations were from smaller litters (P = 0.04), and were larger at 6 months (P = 0.02) and at 1 year of age (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that age (P &lt; 0.001), BCS (P = 0.03) and HOMA (P = 0.047) remained significantly associated with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that early growth and nutrition, larger body size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be environmental modifiers of genetic predisposition to HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of early nutrition on the phenotypic expression of HCM </plain></SENT>
