<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that intracardiac electrogram T-wave alternans (IE-TWA) is greater prior to spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) than for baseline recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate IE-TWA just prior to VTA episodes and at baseline and compare these with microvolt TWA (M-TWA) measured during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed right ventricular ring-can electrogram recordings just prior to VTA episodes and compared T-wave pattern and degree of variation to baseline recordings from 3 patients (2 with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) who were enrolled in the Japan Intracardiac Electrogram TWA Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> Recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a stable state, we measured the M-TWA of the surface electrocardiogram during treadmill exercise in these 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 3 patterns of IE-TWA among these 3 patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator immediately prior to spontaneous VTAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 1 had AB pattern of IE-TWA, case 2 ABC pattern, and case 3 nonspecific pattern but great T-wave amplitude variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These IE-TWA amplitudes and the distribution of T-amplitude difference were greater than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 1 had a positive outcome in regard to the M-TWA determination, whereas cases 2 and 3 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We indicate different patterns of IE-TWA prior to spontaneous VTAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The phenomena of IE-TWA correspond to outcomes of M-TWA measured during exercise in the surface electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
