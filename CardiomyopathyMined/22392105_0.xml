<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMR images from 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 11 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each subject, equivalent mid-papillary level short-axis cine steady-state free precession and MT slices from the same examination were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time to peak circumferential strain and magnitude of the peak strain were calculated for 6 matched left ventricular segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from 24 slices (n = 144 segments) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean difference between techniques in magnitude of peak strain and time to peak strain was 1 ± 9% and 1 ± 58 ms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean difference in the standard deviation of time to peak strain within a slice was 0 ± 19 ms (mean cardiac cycle duration 1,013 ± 204 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analysis showed closer agreement in time to peak strain than peak strain magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements of segmental time to peak strain by TT and MT were in close agreement; agreement for the magnitude of peak segmental strain was more modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TT approach does not add to CMR examination time and may be a useful tool for the assessment of ventricular synchrony </plain></SENT>
