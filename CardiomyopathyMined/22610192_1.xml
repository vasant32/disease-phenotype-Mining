<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Teaching hospital research laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Cecal ligation and puncture in mice was performed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice that underwent cecal ligation and puncture were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg) or vehicle 1 mL <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> 0.9% subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck directly after surgery and at 16, 24, and 40 hrs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Forty-eight hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, cardiac performance was established using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity was evaluated with electron microscopy, and changes in gene expression were evaluated with microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival at 48 hrs was just under 50% and comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myocardial contractile function significantly improved after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi>-treated mice developed focal areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, whereas vehicle-treated mice developed significant, diffuse myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed widespread <z:mp ids='MP_0011632'>swollen mitochondria</z:mp> with ruptured outer membranes, autophagosomes, and vacuolation of the internal compartment, which were significantly attenuated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased cardiac expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment resulted in upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator gene set containing genes known to be regulated by this transcriptional coactivator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> modulates bioenergy metabolism, substrate utilization, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and detoxification pathways associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and cardiac pathological conditions, but does not alter mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The salutary effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> on cecal ligation and puncture-induced myocardial dysfunction are associated with increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a abundance and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preservation of myocardial energy production capacity, prevention of secondary injury, mitigation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>-induced myocardial remodeling are likely to underlie its beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This however, does not result in improved survival </plain></SENT>
