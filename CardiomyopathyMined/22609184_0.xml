<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) remains the gold standard for detecting rejection episodes in orthotopic heart transplant (OTH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up protocols vary widely between transplant centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At our center, we have implemented a conservative strategy protocol and here we report our outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from 2 cohorts were used for comparison analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OHT recipients from 1990 to 1995 comprised the standard strategy group, and those from 2004 to 2009 comprised the conservative strategy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival outcomes and rejection episodes were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at OHT was 56 ± 10 years in the standard strategy group and 53 ± 10 years in the conservative strategy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups were predominantly composed of white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in more than 50% of the patients in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From 6 to 12 months after OHT, we found that the number of episodes of rejection/total number of EMBs was 4.9% (8/163) in the standard group vs 2.0% (1/50) in the conservative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From 12 to 24 months after transplant, the rate was 2.5% (8/320) in the standard group vs 11.9% (5/42) in the conservative group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance EMB after 6 months post-OHT in patients receiving contemporary immunosuppression is associated with a low yield of EMB-confirmed rejection in the absence of a clinical indication or echocardiographic findings that support clinical rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most episodes of cellular rejection are mild and do not warrant treatment or a change in immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EMBs did not correlate with an increased risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
