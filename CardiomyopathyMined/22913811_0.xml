<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of the mononuclear infiltrate is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using experimentally infected fish, we investigated localization of the causative agent, piscine <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> virus (PMCV), within the heart and characterized the cell population associated with myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular and transcriptional characteristics in the lesions were compared with adjacent non-infiltrated tissues using laser capture microdissection, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that PMCV is almost exclusively present in myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory infiltrate comprises a variety of leucocyte populations, including T cells, B cells, MHC class II(+) and CD83(+) cells, most likely of the macrophage line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation analyses demonstrated co-ordinated leucocyte activity at the site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular proliferation and/or DNA repair was demonstrated within the myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Different cell populations, mainly myocytes, stained positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Densities of endothelial cells and fibroblasts were not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence of PMCV and various inflammatory cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myocardial lesions analysed may indicate that both <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic and immunopathological effects may contribute to the pathogenesis of CMS </plain></SENT>
