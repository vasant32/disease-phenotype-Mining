<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, under different biological phenotypes, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the members of a gene set will participate in a biological process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is useful to construct a discriminative classifier by focusing on the core members (subset) of a highly informative gene set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such analyses can reveal which of those subsets from the same gene set correspond to different biological phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we propose Gene Set Top Scoring Pairs (GSTSP) approach that exploits the simple yet powerful relative expression reversal concept at the gene set levels to achieve these goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the usefulness of GSTSP, we applied this method to five different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> gene expression data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We take advantage of the direct data integration feature in the GSTSP approach to combine two data sets, identify a discriminative gene set from &gt;190 predefined gene sets, and evaluate the predictive power of the GSTSP classifier derived from this informative gene set on three independent test sets (79.31% in test accuracy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discriminative gene pairs identified in this study may provide new biological understanding on the disturbed pathways that are involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GSTSP methodology is general in purpose and is applicable to a variety of phenotypic classification problems using gene expression data </plain></SENT>
