<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This prospective double-blinded randomized study tested the hypothesis that preoperative treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> would attenuate inflammatory priming of the myocardium, reduce the systemic inflammatory reaction upon cardiac operation, and provide organ protection in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty neonates (age, 8 to 21 days) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> scheduled for arterial switch operation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg body weight) 4 hours before cardiopulmonary bypass, and 11 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26708">natrium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied intramyocardial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), as well as IL-10 and expression of TNF-α on protein level in right atrial tissue taken before institution of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> binding protein, and cardiac troponin T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokine expression was related to postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> led to a significant decrease in myocardial expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and to a decrease in protein synthesis of TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of IL-6 were significantly lower and those of IL-10 significantly higher in pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with lower cardiac troponin T values and lower dobutamine requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> binding protein were significantly higher postoperatively in pretreated neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> administration before arterial switch operation leads to a shift in the myocardial and systemic cytokine expression profile in neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>, with downregulation of proinflammatory and upregulation of antiinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower myocardial cell damage and lower <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> requirement suggest myocardial protection in treated patients </plain></SENT>
