<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We evaluated ambulatory patients with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> from the cardiovascular standpoint and studied the correlation between the results of electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin T and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) levels and patients' North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients of ages 6-12 (8.9 ± 2.8) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac evaluation included electrocardiography, echocardiography and cardiac enzyme tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: North Star scores ranged from 6/34 to 34/34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (56%) had ECG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequently seen <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005165'>short PR interval</z:hpo> (14%, n= 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (16%, n= 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> (10%, n= 5), prominent Q wave (10%, n= 5) and T wave inversion (44%, n= 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (20%), LVEF was below 55%, troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated (P= 0.003 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When North Star scores were compared to patients' age, enzyme levels, ECG and echocardiographic results, we discovered negative correlation with age (P &lt; 0.001) and troponin T levels (P= 0.02) and positive correlation with LVEF (P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with North Star scores of ≤16 are more at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Troponin T is a cardiac index that can be used for evaluating myopathic patients and it seems to be correlated with the proBNP levels and LVEF values </plain></SENT>
