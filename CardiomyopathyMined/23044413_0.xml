<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its application during concomitant cardiogenic shock has been discussed controversially, and still <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is used with reserve when haemodynamic parameters are impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> improves force development in isolated human myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> could beneficially affect cardiac function in patients during cardiogenic shock METHODS: 14 Patients, admitted to Intensive Care Unit for cardiogenic shock under inotropic support, were enrolled and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (33Â°C) was induced for either one (n=5,short-term) or twenty-four (n=9, mid-term) hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 12 patients suffered from ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 2 were female, and 6 were included after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was controlled by an intravascular cooling device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> consistently <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp>, and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, cardiac index and cardiac power output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic and electrocardiographic parametersremained constant during cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved cardiac function persisted during mid-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, but was reversed during rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse side effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> is safe and feasable in patients during cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> improved parameters of cardiac function, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> might be considered as a positive inotropic intervention rather than a risk for patients during cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
