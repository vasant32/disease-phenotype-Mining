<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, it was believed that patients with FAP, caused by the TTR V30M mutation, shared the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have clearly shown that the V30M mutation in Sweden occurred spontaneously later in time than that in Portugal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Swedish FAP-population's phenotype differs between various areas within northern Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is in average 20 years earlier in Skellefteå than in Piteå areas, a distance of only 60 km </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> appears also to have an impact on complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> cases often develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, especially male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> haplotype distribution has been noted to differ between early- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late- onset</z:hpo> patients in the Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function is one possible factor contributing to the differences seen both between and within populations </plain></SENT>
