<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HOCM) is characterised by asymmetric <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp>, which is most pronounced in the interventricular septum (IVS) and is responsible for the dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful alcohol septal ablation (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) of the IVS allows to reduce the thickness of the parabasal part of the IVS myocardium and, in most cases, to permanently reduce the gradient in the LVOT.〈/p〉 Aim: To assess, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the impact of gradient reduction in the LVOT on the type and severity of left ventricular (LV) remodelling.〈/p〉 Methods: The study included 30 patients (aged 56.9 ± 11.9 years) with HOCM and the mean peak gradient (PG) in the LVOT of 123 ± 33 mm Hg who underwent <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed before and at 6 months after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and TTE measurements were performed before, at 3 months and at 6 months after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>.〈/p〉 Results: PG in the LVOT decreased to an average of 52 ± 37 mm Hg (p 〈 0.0001) at 3 months after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and to 37 ± 28 mm Hg (p 〈 0.0001) at 6 months after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TTE revealed a decrease in IVS thickness outside the scar following <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> from 23.6 ± 3.5 mm to 19.3 ± 4.0 mm (p 〈 0.0001) and 19.4 ± 0.4 mm (p 〈 0.0001) at 3 and 6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also a decrease in lateral wall (PW) thickness from 15.9 ± 3.2 mm to 14.9 ± 2.9 mm (p = 0.046) and 14.16 ± 2.00 (p = 0.0065) at 3 and 6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a decrease in IVS thickness from 23.7 ± 2.8 mm to 18.04 ± 4.00 mm (p = 0.0001) at 6 months following <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a regression of the PW <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> from 13.2 ± 3.35 mm to 12.18 ± 2.4 mm (p = 0.0225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease in IVS mass from 108.9 ± 20 g to 91.5 ± 29 g (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a decreased LV mass and LV mass excluding IVS mass at 6 months.〈/p〉 Conclusions: A significant decrease in PG in the LVOT is associated with a decrease in LV mass and with regression of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> outside the scar after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>.〈/p〉 </plain></SENT>
