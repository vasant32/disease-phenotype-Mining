<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associated with ventricular dysfunction, LVNC can present in isolation or in conjunction with structural heart defects (i.e., "nonisolated" LVNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it was once considered to be difficult and unreliable, successful detection of this condition by way of fetal echocardiography has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present what is to our knowledge the first prenatal diagnosis of LVNC in monochorionic-monozygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonisolated LVNC was identified in twins A and B at 23Â weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A noncompaction-to-compaction ratio &gt;2 was documented in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was observed in the twins: Twin A presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo> with an intact ventricular septum, critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0010446'>tricuspid stenosis</z:hpo>, and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010422'>right-ventricular hypoplasia</z:mp>, whereas twin B presented with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000286'>mitral valve dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite an initially complicated postnatal course for twin A, this case shows that it is feasible to achieve good outcomes with accurate prenatal detection and aggressive postnatal management </plain></SENT>
