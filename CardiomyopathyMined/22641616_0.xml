<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">Imatinib</z:chebi> has been reported to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and left ventricular contractile dysfunction in patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in rodents, findings proposed to be associated with its pharmacological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the specific role of Abelson oncogene 1 (c-Abl) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-induced cardiac toxicity, we performed targeted gene inhibition of c-Abl by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference in neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suppression of c-Abl did not lead to cytotoxicity or induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further dis associate c-Abl from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-induced cardiac toxicity, we designed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> structural analogs that do not have appreciable c-Abl inhibition in NCMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The c-Abl inactive analogs induced cytotoxicity and ER stress, at similar or greater potencies and magnitudes as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, combining c-Abl gene silencing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> and analogs treatment did not significantly shift the cytotoxicity dose response curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">Imatinib</z:chebi> and analogs were shown to accumulate in lysosomes, likely due to their physicochemical properties, and disrupt autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The toxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> and analogs can be rescued by bafilomycin A pretreatment, demonstrating the involvement of lysosomal accumulation in cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results from our studies strongly suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction through disruption of autophagy and induction of ER stress, independent of c-Abl inhibition </plain></SENT>
