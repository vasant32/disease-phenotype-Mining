<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence and function of serum autoantibodies against calcium channels (CC-AAbs) in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcium-channel AAbs were detected in 80 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and 80 controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcium-channel AAbs were further purified by affinity chromatography for characterization by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Voltage-clamp experiments were performed to identify the function of CC-AAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of CC-AAbs was shown effectively by ELISA, and CC-AAbs were able specifically to bind to the calcium channel on the myocyte, confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calcium currents were enhanced by CC-AAbs on Xenopus oocytes expressing human Ca(V)1.2 channels, which suggested CC-AAbs in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-like </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest there are novel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-like CC-AAbs in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcium-channel AAbs might play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
