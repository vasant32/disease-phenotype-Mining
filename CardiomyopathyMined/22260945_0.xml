<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> carries a poor prognosis secondary to a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> previously attributed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of conduction abnormalities in this population and their relationship to life-threatening events has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> diagnosed between April 1994 and May 2011 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, cardiac, and ECG characteristics and the mechanisms of serious arrhythmic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic compromise thought to be secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (1-17 years of age) were reviewed, with 5 sudden cardiac events noted, including 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were caused by development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>; another patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> had intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> and survived as the result of pacing features of an implanted defibrillator system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median PR interval (222 versus 144 ms; P&lt;0.01) and the QRS duration (111 versus 74; P=0.01) were significantly longer in those who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age at presentation was associated with sudden cardiac events (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other functional or echocardiographic variables were associated with a sudden cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, and, in this cohort, bradycardic events represented a significant portion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aggressive ECG monitoring strategies looking for conduction system disease should be ongoing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Implantation of a defibrillator/pacemaker should be considered as prophylactic management </plain></SENT>
