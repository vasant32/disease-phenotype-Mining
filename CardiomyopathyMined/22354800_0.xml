<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These can be accompanied by a reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF, systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) or by a preserved function (HFPEF, diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of both entities is distinct and involves impairment of myocardial metabolism and coronary circulation alike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> often coincide, the management of these patients particularly with respect to the specific benefits or possible hazards of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment is vague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, from a pathophysiological as well as clinical viewpoint, 1) diabetic patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> have to be differentiated regarding systolic as well as diastolic left ventricular function by echocardiography and tissue doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> in diabetic patients needs similar attention due to a prognosis and interactions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">Antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication has to be specifically adapted for both entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As prospective, controlled studies are scarce, future interventional studies should specifically focus on clinical outcome in diabetic patients with different entities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
