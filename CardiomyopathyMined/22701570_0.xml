<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RT-qPCR was used to quantify <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and immunoblotting to confirm protein expression in left-ventricular myocardium from patients with HF (n = 36) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> of ischaemic (ICM, n = 16) or dilated (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, n = 20) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> aetiology, and non-diseased donors (CTL, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of genes regulating FA uptake (CD36) and intracellular transport (Heart-FA-Binding Protein (HFABP)) were observed in HF patients vs CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significance was maintained in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and confirmed at protein level, but not in ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was higher in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> than ICM for peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-alpha (PPARA), PPAR-gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC1A) and CD36, and confirmed at the protein level for PPARA and CD36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcript and protein expression of Ca(2+)-handling genes (Two-Pore-Channel 1 (TPCN1), Two-Pore-Channel 2 (TPCN2), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">Inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> Receptor type-1 (IP3R1)) increased in HF patients relative to CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases remained significant for TPCN2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups but for TPCN1 only in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were correlations between FA metabolism and Ca(2+)-handling genes expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ICM there were six correlations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distinct from those found in CTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> there were also six (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> also different from those found in CTL): three were common to and three distinct from ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-specific increases were found in expression of several genes that regulate FA metabolism, which might help in the design of aetiology-specific metabolic therapies in HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)-handling genes TPCN1 and TPCN2 also showed increased expression in HF, while HF- and CM-specific positive correlations were found among several FA and Ca(2+)-handling genes </plain></SENT>
