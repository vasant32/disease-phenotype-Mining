<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent guidelines provide recommendations for cardiac screening and genetic testing in at-risk relatives, but the uptake and impact of these measures in the United States is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a single institution retrospective study that characterizes the uptake of cardiac screening and genetic testing for relatives of a cohort of 57 probands with hypertrophic (HCM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) who underwent both clinical evaluation and genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac screening was indicated for 302 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-three (57 %) completed cardiac screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty of the 57 probands were mutation positive and genetic testing was indicated for 213 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four (39 %) completed genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The uptake of cardiac surveillance was greater than the uptake of genetic testing (p &lt; 0.0001) among relatives of mutation positive probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the group of at-risk, asymptomatic relatives of probands, cardiac screening and genetic testing were positive in 25 % and 40 % of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the important role and utility of cascade cardiac screening and genetic testing in the care of patients and families with HCM or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The approach to cardiac screening and genetic testing should be family-specific and requires expertise in the genetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
