<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Naxos and Carvajal syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> forms of ARVC/D, are characterised by involvement of the right and/or left ventricle in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000982'>palmoplantar keratoderma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002224'>woolly hair</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study has been to screen for mutations in the desmosomal protein genes of two unrelated patients with Naxos-Carvajal syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Desmosomal protein genes were screened for mutations by polymerase chain reaction as well as direct sequencing approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient we identified a single heterozygous de novo mutation in the desmoplakin gene DSP, p.Leu583Pro and p.Thr564Ile, leading to severe combined cardiac/dermatological and cardiac/dermatological/dental phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DSP missense mutations are localised in the N terminal domain of desmoplakin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The identified variations in DSP involve highly conserved residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the variations are de novo mutations and they are localised in critical protein domains that appear to be mutation hot spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assume that these heterozygous variations are causal for the mixed Naxos-Carvajal syndrome phenotype in the screened patients </plain></SENT>
