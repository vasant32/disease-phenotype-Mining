<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, they have been widely investigated for their association with diseases, such as, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To facilitate further studies of S100 proteins, we reported a simple and efficient method for the expression and purification of human S100A4 and S100A11 proteins in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since S100 proteins share many common physical and chemical characteristics, we expect that this approach can be extended to the production of most S100 proteins </plain></SENT>
