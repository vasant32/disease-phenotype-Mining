<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It usually occurs after physical or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e>, predominantly in postmenopausal women, although it also can affect younger age groups and males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It often presents as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> and mild elevation of cardiac enzymes suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography excludes obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, and imaging reveals ventricular apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002304'>akinesia</z:hpo> and compensatory hypercontractility of the basal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for the syndrome, such as occult atherosclerotic disease, multivessel spasm and/or microvascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the most widely accepted hypothesis at present is an excess of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> causing calcium overload in cardiac myocytes, leading to disruption of contraction and ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment is essentially supportive, with spontaneous and complete reversal of the changes within days or weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of complications and comorbidities may predict a more adverse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As much is still unknown about <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the number of reported cases is growing, we present a literature review </plain></SENT>
