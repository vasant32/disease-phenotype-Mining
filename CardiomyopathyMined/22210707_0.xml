<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The patho-<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with a history of ABS are more likely to develop left ventricular (LV) mid-cavity or outflow tract obstruction, or have a greater regional LV contractile response to an adrenergic stimulus compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients who had recovered from ABS and 15 age-and sex-matched controls had dobutamine stress echocardiography with incremental doses up to 20 µg/kg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On average ABS subjects had slightly greater basal LV interventricular septal (1.1 ± 0.24 cm vs. 0.93 ± 0.12, P = 0.03) and posterior wall (1.04 ± 0.16 vs. 0.91 ± 0.11 cm, P = 0.02) diameters compared with controls but LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and LV ejection fraction were similar both at rest and after dobutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional and global LV contractility, measured with the strain rate and tissue velocity imaging were also similar during the dobutamine infusion up to 10 µg/kg/min in ABS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mid-LV or LV outflow tract obstruction was not present at rest in any subjects, but was common during peak dobutamine infusion both in the ABS (45%) and controls (53%, P = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic LV obstruction with dobutamine is common in those with and without prior ABS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this study did not identify a greater individual predisposition to LV obstruction, or a different regional or global LV contractile response to dobutamine in patients with a history of ABS compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
