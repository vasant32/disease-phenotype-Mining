<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated which parameters have an independent relationship with N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) levels in HCM patients using echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 103 patients with HCM (82 men, age 53 Â± 12 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic evaluations included left atrial volume index (LAVI) and early diastolic mitral inflow E velocity to early annular Ea velocity ratio (E/Ea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LVMI, maximal wall thickness and LV volumetric parameters were measured using CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median value of NT-proBNP level was 387.0 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean NT-proBNP level in patients with non-apical HCM (n = 69; 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001670'>asymmetric septal hypertrophy</z:hpo>, 11 with diffuse, and 22 with mixed type) was significantly higher than in those with apical HCM (n = 34, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP level was negatively correlated with LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (r = -0.263, P = 0.007) and positively with LVMI (r = 0.225, P = 0.022) and maximal wall thickness (r = 0.495, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the echocardiographic variables, LAVI (r = 0.492, P &lt; 0.001) and E/Ea (r = 0.432, P &lt; 0.001) were correlated with NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, non-apical HCM, increased maximal wall thickness and LAVI were independently related with NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severity of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and diastolic parameters might be important in the elevation of NT-proBNP level in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further evaluation of these parameters in HCM might be warranted </plain></SENT>
