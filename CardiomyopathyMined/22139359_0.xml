<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of preoperative percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) on long-term survival following implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, we used implantable (n=12) and paracorporeal (n=91) LVADs in 103 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients as a bridge to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to LVAD implantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received inotropes, and 25 patients (24%) received PCPS because of cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there were no early mortalities within 30 days after surgery, and patients survived on LVAD for 560±391 days, of whom 9 patients recovered and 32 underwent heart transplantation after 711±360 days of LVAD support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients with preoperative PCPS required nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> inhalation and prolonged inotropic support to maintain adequate LVAD flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level at 1 month after LVAD implantation was significantly higher in patients with preoperative PCPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified preoperative PCPS support as the only significant predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after LVAD implantation and overall survival was significantly better in patients without preoperative PCPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite adequate hemodynamic support after LVAD implantation, patients with preoperative PCPS had significantly worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVAD should be used for patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, before PCPS is required for hemodynamic support </plain></SENT>
