<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a child with BTHS who had an "undulating cardiac phenotype" and ultimately developed decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> requiring mechanical circulatory support with a ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His course was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury requiring placement of an in-line oxygenator to maintain end-organ function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not only was his course complicated by cardiac and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> but his BTHS associated comorbidities complicated the management of his therapy using mechanical assist device support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was successfully supported and subsequently was transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we discuss the management of a child with BTHS using mechanical circulatory support and describe the use of an in-line oxygenator, Quadrox, with the Berlin Excor device </plain></SENT>
