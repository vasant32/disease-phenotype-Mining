<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the preventive role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (Dox)-induced myocardial toxicity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiotoxicity was produced by cumulative administration of Dox (15 mg/kg for two weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg, po) was administered as pretreatment for two weeks and then for two alternate weeks with Dox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The general observations, mortality, histopathology, biomarker enzymes like <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase (CPK), biochemical parameters such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were monitored after three weeks of last dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The repeated administration of Dox induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated with an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> deficit and increased level biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> significantly protected myocardium from the toxic effects of Dox by reducing the elevated level of biomarker enzymes like LDH and CPK and biochemical parameters such as AST, ALT and ALP back to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> increased the reduced level of GSH, SOD and CAT and decreased the elevated level of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The biochemical and histopathology reports support the cardioprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> which could be attributed to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
