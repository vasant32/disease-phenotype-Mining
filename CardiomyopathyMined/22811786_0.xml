<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron Overload</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (IOC) is the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> (TM) patients but conventional Echocardiography fails to predict early cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> is able to demonstrate regional myocardial dysfunction and stress test may reveal abnormalities which are not evident at rest, we wondered if echocardiographic parameters may reveal abnormalities when applied first at rest and then after a physical effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 46 consecutive beta-TM patients and 39 control subjects without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>; two echocardiograms, at baseline and at the end of maximal exercise on supine bicycle ergometer, were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> TM patients had a liver iron assessment by SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and a cardiac iron one by MRI (T2*) evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 38 TM patients had no evidence of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas TM patients did not shown diastolic dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them presented a good global response to exercise, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> detected a reduced increase of the S' waves of left ventricle basal segment during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding seems to have some weak but interesting relations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAPs</z:mp>) values were greater than in control subjects both at rest and after exercise CONCLUSIONS: in our study, exercise stress <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>-echocardiography was able to demonstrate subtle systolic abnormalities that were missed by Conventional Echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine the meaning and the clinical impact of these results </plain></SENT>
