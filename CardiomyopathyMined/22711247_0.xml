<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the opportunity to determine functional parameters and myocardial mass precisely as well as to detect structural changes of the cardiac muscle simultaneously, cardiac MRI is the most precise imaging method for quantifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> as well as determining the cause and the exact characterization of the myocardial changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is mandatory, however, to create a flexible, individually adapted examination protocol </plain></SENT>
