<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether allelic variants in eight sarcomere genes are associated with cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function in the community, we sequenced 3,600 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e>) and Jackson Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JHS</z:e>) cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of the total, 11.2% of individuals had one or more rare nonsynonymous sarcomere variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of likely pathogenic sarcomere variants was 0.6%, twice the previous estimates; however, only four of the 22 individuals had clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rare sarcomere variants were associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 2.3) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e> cohort, suggesting that cardiovascular risk assessment in the general population can benefit from rare variant analysis </plain></SENT>
