<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its identification is of critical importance as it is a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the young and can lead to considerable morbidity, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are several conditions that can mimic the phenotypic appearance of HCM on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography remains an invaluable tool in both initial diagnosis and regular surveillance of patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no single echocardiographic parameter is ideal, a structured and comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function will provide invaluable clues to the diagnosis and often hint towards an alternate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to reassess the typical echocardiographic features of HCM and to highlight echocardiographic features that may help to distinguish other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) </plain></SENT>
