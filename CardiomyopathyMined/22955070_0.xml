<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are several published studies on the evolution and prognosis of patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, reports on the therapeutic management in clinical practice are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze coronary revascularization (CR) performance in patients with ICM and suitable coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> according to myocardial perfusion stress-rest gated SPECT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 62.4 y; 20 women), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> suitable for CR, and without previous CR, were evaluated by means of stress-rest gated SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients had scintigraphic criteria of viability and 62.1% showed scintigraphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in stress-rest gated SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-five percent of patients were revascularized, and the remainder received medical treatment only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coronary revascularization was more frequent in patients with scintigraphic viability (P = 0.012), in those with scintigraphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P = 0.007), and in those with low left ventricular end-systolic volume (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified multivessel disease [hazard ratio (HR), 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4-7.8], summed difference score greater than 4 (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.5-9.8), and left ventricular end-systolic volume less than 120 mL (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-8.2) as the best independent predictors of CR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ICM and suitable coronary arteries who are able to perform a stress myocardial perfusion-gated SPECT, the presence of multivessel disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and the absence of severely increased left ventricular volume were associated to a decision of CR </plain></SENT>
