<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (PEX), echocardiographic assessment can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are little data on the impact of the chest deformity on echocardiographic findings and comparison of data obtained by echocardiography (echo) with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in PEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo> in PEX were analysed by echo and compared with CMR in consecutive patients with PEX referred for echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If they agreed to participate, the patients were referred for CMR and included if the pectus index was ≥3.0 by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, clinical data and electrocardiogram tracings were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 18 patients (13 females; 72%), with a mean age of 53±16 years; mean pectus index was 4.7 (range: 3-7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echo showed haemodynamically insignificant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> in six patients (33%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> in five (28%), right ventricular (RV) localized wall motion anomalies (WMA) in five (28%) and diminished RV systolic function in two (11%); no patient had RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMR demonstrated cardiac displacement to the left in 9 patients (50%); minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> was seen in 10 patients (56%; P value=0.13 compared with echo), RV localized WMA in 6 (44%; P value=1.0), diminished RV systolic function in 8 (44%; P=0.07), and RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 5 (28%; P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac examination was found in six patients by echo (33%) and in 2 (11%) using CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although some signs of arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) were present, no patient fulfilled the ARVC criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In severe PEX, haemodynamically insignificant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> and other RV anomalies possibly due to RV displacement are frequent as demonstrated by both CMR and echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cardiac assessment by echo and CMR did show discrepancies; however, they were not significant </plain></SENT>
