<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In pediatric settings, pure HCM has an estimated incidence of 4.7 per million children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease is often sub-clinical and goes unrecognized mainly because most patients with HCM have only mild symptoms, if any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, the most dramatic clinical occurrence and the primary concern for patients and physicians alike, may be the first manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of compound heterozygosity in the MYBPC3 gene (p.Glu258Lys and IVS25-1G&gt;A) associated with biventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, atrial enlargement and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> 33 days postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other studies have reported compound and/or double heterozygosis in the same or different sarcomeric genes during childhood and adulthood, and neonatal presentations have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations show that the combination of a missense (p.Glu258Lys) and a splice-site mutation (IVS25-1G&gt;A) profoundly affects the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In families in which parental mutations are known, preimplantation (where ethically and legally feasible) or prenatal genetic screening should be adopted because: (1) neonatal HCM in genetic heterozygosity is potentially lethal and (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> is the most common developmental malformation and the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
