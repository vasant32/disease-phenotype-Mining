<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">Mannose</z:chebi> binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule in innate immunity, while macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a constitutive element of the host defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible association between polymorphisms of MBL2 and MIF genes and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> in Turkish children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-children with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> and 30 healthy controls were analyzed for codon 54 A/B polymorphism in MBL, and -173 G/C polymorphism in MIF genes by using PCR-RFLP methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between genotypes and alleles of MBL2 gene codon 54 A/B polymorphism in patients and controls (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels was found higher in dilated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> patients with AA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of MIF -173 CC genotype was significantly higher in patients (p&lt;0.05), and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels were higher in patients with MIF -173 CC genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to investigate the MBL and MIF gene polymorphisms in Turkish children with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CC genotype of MIF (-173) polymorphism may be a risk factor for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further studies with larger samples are needed to address the exact role of this polymorphism in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
