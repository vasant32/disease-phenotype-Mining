<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNDC">Alpers syndrome</z:e> is one of the most common phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disorders in early childhood and has been associated with pathogenic mutations in POLG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the phenotypic-genotypic correlations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNDC">Alpers syndrome</z:e> and to identify potential differences among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNDC">Alpers syndrome</z:e> with or without pathogenic POLG1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNDC">Alpers syndrome</z:e> who were referred to our pediatric hospital during 1984-2007 and were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> encephalomyopathy underwent further biochemical, morphological and genetic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were included in the study, of whom six had pathogenic POLG1 mutations including a novel mutation (c.907 G&gt;A, p.Gly303Arg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete mtDNA sequencing in the subgroup without POLG1 mutations showed 5 novel and 5 very rare mtDNA variants considered as rare polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to POLG1(-) patients, the POLG1(+) patients more frequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, which often became refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> were much more common, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> were encountered almost solely in the POLG1(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatic and ophthalmological involvement developed in 79% and 88% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients in both groups had predominant deficiency of complex I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to the major degenerative changes in the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, thalamus and white matter were also involved to variable extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205710" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNDC">Alpers syndrome</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> syndrome that should be considered in patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> progressive cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> regardless of liver involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The phenotype is different depending on the presence or absence of POLG1 mutations </plain></SENT>
