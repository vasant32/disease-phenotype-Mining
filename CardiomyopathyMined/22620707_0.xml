<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: 6 adult cats with severe naturally occurring HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: Each cat was anesthetized twice (once for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> treatment and once for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> treatment; treatment order was randomized) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> was induced by increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary data, including measurement of plasma concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), were obtained before anesthesia, 20 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and 20 minutes after each incremental infusion of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg/min) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ± SD end-tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> concentration for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was 2.44 ± 0.05% and 2.48 ± 0.04%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac index and tissue oxygen delivery were significantly increased after administration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, compared with results after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic vascular resistance index was significantly increased after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, compared with results after administration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oxygen consumption remained unchanged for both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures were increased after administration of both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acid-base status and blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration did not change and were not different between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cTnI concentration increased during anesthesia and infusion of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> but did not differ significantly between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> induced dose-dependent increases in systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, but only <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003394'>increased cardiac output</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> and infusions of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> caused significant increases in cTnI concentrations </plain></SENT>
