<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively correlated gross, histologic, and clinical findings pertaining to hearts explanted in a 5-year period from patients with a clinical diagnosis of nonischemic CM and also correlated left ventricular diameter with preoperative echocardiographic reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 64 patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DC), 42 were men (age, 51 ± 13 y) and 22 were women (age, 42 ± 18 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathologic diagnosis was idiopathic (dilated) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DC) in 55 patients (86%) and features of specific CM in 9 patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnoses were fibrofatty change consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (n=2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (n=1), none of which were suspected clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 55 hearts with idiopathic DC had a mean heart weight of 508 (range, 220 to 980) g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathologic subsets of the DC group included 4 hearts without enlargement, cavity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, or significant histologic findings (minimal DC); 3 hearts with histologic evidence of healed <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>; and 5 hearts with mildly noncompacted left ventricle with hypertrabeculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had prior mitral or tricuspid valve replacement/repairs to manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 7 postpartum DC cases, 1 with a histologic pattern of healed <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and 1 alcoholism-associated DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Familial DC comprised 16% (9 of 55) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients without prior assist device placement, pathologic left ventricular cavity diameter correlated with echocardiographic end-diastolic volume (r , 0.8, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, DC is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Areas of fibrofatty change and features of noncompaction are not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular measurement at explant correlates well with echocardiographic findings, with a relatively consistent underestimation of the diameter </plain></SENT>
