<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical use is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that results in irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>, a pirarubicin liposome powder (L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> and free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> (F-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> as compared to F-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> can be greatly ameliorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the preliminary efficacy study of L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> was evaluated in the approach of in vitro cytotoxicity on A549 cells by high content screening (HCS) analysis, and L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> was found to exhibit better therapeutic index against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
