<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) is a sensitive biomarker of left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of cardiac injury in HIV-infected and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients with or without antiretroviral (ARV) therapy by comparing BNP serum levels in the groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty HIV-infected patients (65 men, 15 women, mean age 40 years; 29 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1698259" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HCV coinfection</z:e>, 48 on combined ARV therapy) were included in the cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BNP serum levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BNP cut-off level for possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was 42 fmol/l as in an immunocompetent population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight (97.5%) patients studied had a BNP concentration above 42 fmol/l; seven patients (8.7%) had a concentration above 168 fmol/l associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the mean BNP serum levels in ARV-treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the mean BNP serum level was significantly higher in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients in comparison with HIV-monoinfected patients (160.0±130.9 vs. 81.9±37.2 fmol/l; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between BNP serum levels and HIV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, CD4 cell count, sex, age, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2360">abacavir</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1698259" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HCV coinfection</z:e> and BNP serum level in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1698259" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HCV coinfection</z:e> possibly enhances the risk of left ventricular dysfunction development in this vulnerable population </plain></SENT>
