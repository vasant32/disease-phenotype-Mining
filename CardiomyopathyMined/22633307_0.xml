<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the changes in plasma matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that occur early after the clinical presentation of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients with SIC were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of the 6 major MMPs (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 TIMPs (1, 2, 3, and 4) were analyzed and compared with data from 15 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours of the clinical presentation, SIC patients had lower MMP-1 levels (0.41 ± 0.13 vs 0.70 ± 0.13 pg/mL; P = .048) and MMP-8 levels (1.61 ± 0.34 vs 4.84 ± 1.38 pg/mL; P = .001) and higher TIMP-4 levels (3.06 ± 0.40 vs 2.16 ± 0.18 pg/mL; P = .05) compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of 9 SIC patients had elevated LV end-diastolic pressures, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV end-diastolic dimensions and volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients afflicted with SIC had MMP and TIMP profiles similar to those described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> and diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and different from the profiles following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings uncovered a unique biomolecular profile in SIC during the first 24 hours of presentation </plain></SENT>
