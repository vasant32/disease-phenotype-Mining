<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a 3-arm case-control study to assess differences in demographic and co-morbid predictors of SC compared to orthopedic controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) controls to characterize (1) population-level predictors of SC generally and (2) differences and similarities in determinants of SC compared to MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discharges of patients diagnosed with SC from the 2008 to 2009 National Inpatient Samples and randomly selected 1-to-1 age-matched controls from patients hospitalized with MI and patients hospitalized with joint injuries after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used McNemar tests to assess differences in demographic characteristics and co-morbidities between patients with SC and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 24,701 patients with SC in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients with SC, 89.0% were women compared to 38.9% of patients with MI and 55.7% of orthopedic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SC were more likely to be white and to reside in wealthier ZIP codes compared to MI and orthopedic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SC were less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> compared to MI and orthopedic controls but were more likely to have had histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">disorders, mood</z:e> disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, demographic and co-morbid predictors of SC differ substantially from those of MI and may be of interest to providers when diagnosing SC </plain></SENT>
