<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study hypothesized that time-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy will reduce the risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias among patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICM) enrolled in the MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy exerts antiarrhythmic properties among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on arrhythmic risk among patients with NICM are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, evaluated as a time-dependent covariate, on the risk of appropriate defibrillator therapy for fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) (defined as a rate faster than 180 beats/min)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (primary endpoint) and appropriate defibrillator shocks (secondary endpoint) among 821 patients with NICM enrolled in the MADIT-CRT trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> users (n = 499) were older and had a higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> yet were less frequently smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that time-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy was independently associated with a significant 77% reduction in the risk of fast VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) and with a significant 46% reduction in the risk of appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, the cumulative probability of fast VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 4 years of follow-up was significantly lower among patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (11%) as compared with study patients who were not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (19%; p = 0.006 for the overall difference during follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias among patients with NICM </plain></SENT>
