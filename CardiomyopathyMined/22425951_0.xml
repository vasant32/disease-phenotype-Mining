<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous microRNA (miRNA) array results have shown that the expression of miR-27b is upregulated in heart tissues from human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and pressure-overloaded hypertrophic mouse model, implying that miR-27b might play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the in vivo function of miR-27b, we generated a transgenic mouse line overexpressing miR-27b under the control of the 5.5 kb promoter of a-myosin heavy chain (a-MHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR results demonstrated that miR-27b precursor and mature miR-27b were significantly increased in the heart tissues of miR-27b transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>miR-27b transgenic mice not only displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, but also exhibited significant <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further study showed that matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), a key regulator involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, was the target of miR-27b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP13 was decreased and the expression of Col I and III was increased in miR-27b transgenic mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, defects in ultrastructral architecture were also found in miR-27b trans-genic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above results demonstrated that miR-27b might promote <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> through inhibiting MMP13 </plain></SENT>
