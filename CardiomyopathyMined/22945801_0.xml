<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher eukaryotes have two isoforms, CAP1 and CAP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the in vivo function of CAP2, we generated mice in which the CAP2 gene was inactivated by a gene-trap approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice showed a decrease in body weight and had a <z:mp ids='MP_0008770'>decreased survival rate</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, they developed a severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> marked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) associated with drastic reduction in basal heart rate and prolongations in atrial and ventricular conduction times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CAP2-deficient myofibrils exhibited reduced cooperativity of calcium-regulated force development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the microscopic level, we observed disarrayed sarcomeres with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed CAP2's role in actin assembly and found that it sequesters G-actin and efficiently fragments filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This activity resides completely in its WASP homology domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus CAP2 is an essential component of the myocardial sarcomere and is essential for physiological functioning of the cardiac system, and a deficiency leads to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and various <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
