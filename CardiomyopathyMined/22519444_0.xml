<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zing dependent endo-peptidases found in most living organisms and act mainly by degrading ECM components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most MMPs are formed as inactive proenzymes and are activated by proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This process depends and is regulated by other proteases and endogenous MMP inhibitors (TIMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMPs and TIMPs play a major role not only in ECM degradation but also in mediating cell migration, proliferation, tissue remodeling; acting as a signal for the production and secretion of growth factors and cytokines </plain></SENT>
