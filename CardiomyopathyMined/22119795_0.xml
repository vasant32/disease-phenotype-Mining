<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the role of this isoform, we have produced a new knockout mouse line that lacks Cox7a1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that homozygous and heterozygous Cox7a1 knockout mice, although viable, have reduced Cox activity and develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at 6 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> improves and stabilizes by 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox7a1 knockout mice incorporate more of the "liver-type" isoform Cox7a2 into the cardiac Cox holoenzyme and, also surprisingly, have higher tissue ATP levels </plain></SENT>
