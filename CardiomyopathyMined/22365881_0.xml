<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate LV systolic dyssynchrony in pediatric patients with HF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among a total of 68 patients, 22 had HF and 46 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doppler tissue imaging, M-mode echocardiography, and pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular dyssynchrony using the maximal difference in time to peak myocardial systolic contraction (Ts), the standard deviation of Ts of 12 LV segments, septal-to-posterior wall motion delay, and interventricular dyssynchrony by measuring aortic and pulmonary pre-ejection delays were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximal difference in Ts (patients with HF, 91.27 ± 31.18 msec; controls, 45.93 ± 21.29 msec; P &lt; .001), the standard deviation of Ts (patients with HF, 31.05 ± 10.68 msec; controls, 15.60 ± 7.70 msec; P &lt; .001), septal-to-posterior wall motion delay (patients with HF, 117.14 ± 45.18 msec; controls, 48.69 ± 16.63 msec; P &lt; .001) and interventricular dyssynchrony (patients with HF, 21.60 ± 16.27 msec; controls, 11.56 ± 9.38 msec; P = .03) were significantly prolonged in the HF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defining systolic dyssynchrony as a standard deviation of Ts &gt; 31 msec (+2 standard deviations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) and a maximal difference in Ts &gt; 89 msec in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 18 patients with HF due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was included for analysis of systolic dyssynchrony; it was present in three (6.5%) and two (4.3%) controls and in nine (50%) and 10 (55%) patients with HF due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low ejection fraction, elevated LV end-diastolic volume, and elevated LV end-systolic volume had significant correlations with systolic dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QRS duration was not significantly correlated with measures of dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systolic mechanical dyssynchrony is common in pediatric patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>QRS duration is not a determinant of systolic dyssynchrony in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic measurements of systolic dyssynchrony are feasible in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
