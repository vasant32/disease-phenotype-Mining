<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) is usually associated with marked diastolic dysfunction, characterized by impaired myocardial relaxation and increased myocardial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The noninvasive evaluation of diastolic function in these patients remains a challenge since usual methods have shown a modest correlation with invasive measurements of left ventricular (LV) relaxation and filling pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with obstructive HCM who underwent cardiac catheterization and echocardiography performed within 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard echocardiographic diastolic parameters and systolic and diastolic myocardial mechanics (including longitudinal and circumferential strain [S] and strain rate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33324">[Sr]</z:chebi>), LV rotation, and early reverse rotation rate (fraction of early apical reverse rotation [FEARR]) were correlated with diastolic hemodynamic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated LA pressure by echo and the LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or the LV pre-A pressure did not correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal strain was low and circumferential strain was abnormally higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FEARR and negative dp/dt inversely correlated (R =-0.57, P = 0.0001), and early diastolic Sr to systolic Sr ratio (SrE/SrS) correlated with the LVEDP (r = 0.61, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a SrE to SrS ratio ≥0.79 had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 75% for predicting elevated LVEDP (≥15 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average circumferential strain rate during atrial contraction and LV pre-A pressure (r =-0.62, P &lt; 0.001) inversely correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: FEARR is decreased in HCM and appears to be a good measure of diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myocardial mechanics can be used to assess LV relaxation and filling pressures in patients with obstructive HCM </plain></SENT>
