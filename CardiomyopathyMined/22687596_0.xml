<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed data from septal myectomy results as published from 1980 to 2011, most of which come from specialized tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also performed a retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients who underwent HCM surgery at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 4.2 Â± 3.2 years (range, 3 days to 14.2 years), there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within 30 days of surgery for our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the course of 15 years, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in older patients, both of whom had surgery for HCM along with additional cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, the presence of comorbidities, and concomitant cardiac procedures were not statistically significant risk factors for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was excellent: 99%, 99%, and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical myectomy has been proven to be a safe and effective procedure for symptomatic obstructive HCM, and it confers excellent survival similar to that of the healthy population </plain></SENT>
