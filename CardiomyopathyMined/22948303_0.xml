<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is attributed to the intricate interaction between the anterior mitral leaflet, the interventricular septum and altered flow vectors generated in left ventricle along with changes in outflow tract geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in varying degrees is found with or without association with structural deformities of the valve apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exercise echocardiogram evidences latent obstruction easily induced by exercise in 60 to 75% of non-obstructive forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The determination of the gradient under this condition must be considered in routine investigation of patients with mild or no obstruction at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> incorporates methods based on the ultrasound image, which, along with MRI, allow recognizing ventricular obstruction generating mechanisms, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of obstructive and latent obstructive forms </plain></SENT>
