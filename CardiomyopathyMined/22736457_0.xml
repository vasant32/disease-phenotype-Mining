<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FRDA is caused by impaired expression of the FXN gene coding for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein frataxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the past ten years, the development of mouse models of FRDA has allowed better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the mouse models of FRDA, the liver conditional mouse model pointed to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor activity of frataxin leading to the hypothesis that individuals with FRDA might be predisposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we investigated the presence and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the largest FRDA patient cohorts from the USA, Australia and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As no predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> could be observed in both cohorts, we revisited the phenotype of the liver conditional mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that frataxin-deficient livers developed early mitochondriopathy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30408">iron-sulfur cluster</z:chebi> deficits and intramitochondrial dense deposits, classical hallmarks observed in frataxin-deficient tissues and cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With age, a minority of mice developed structures similar to the ones previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these peripheral structures contained dying, frataxin-deficient hepatocytes, whereas the inner liver structure was composed of a pool of frataxin-positive cells, due to inefficient Cre-mediated recombination of the Fxn gene, that contributed to regeneration of a functional liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data demonstrate that frataxin deficiency and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> are not associated </plain></SENT>
