<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is an important clinical manifestation of this disorder, the mechanisms of heart damage are poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the in vitro effects of Phyt on important parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in heart of young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phyt significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances levels (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> formation (P &lt; 0.01), indicating that this fatty acid induces <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and protein oxidative damage, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Phyt did not alter sulfhydryl oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phyt also decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) concentrations (P &lt; 0.05), an important non-enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Phyt increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin oxidation (DCFH) (P &lt; 0.01), reflecting increased reactive species generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that the induced <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and protein oxidative damage, as well as the decreased GSH levels and increased DCFH oxidation provoked by this fatty acid were prevented or attenuated by the reactive oxygen species scavengers <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, trolox, and GSH, but not by the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> inhibitor N: (Ï‰)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-L: -arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, suggesting that reactive oxygen species were involved in these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, we verified that Phyt strongly inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (complex I-III) activity (P &lt; 0.001) in heart supernatants, and decreased membrane potential and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> pool in heart mitochondria, indicating that Phyt acts as a metabolic inhibitor and as an uncoupler of the electron transport chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it can be presumed that disturbance of cellular energy and redox homeostasis induced by Phyt may possibly contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> found in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HMSN4">Refsum disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
