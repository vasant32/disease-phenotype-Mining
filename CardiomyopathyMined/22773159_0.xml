<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge enrichment analysis for tissue specific (TS) and housekeeping (HK) genes may help identify their roles in biological process or diseases and gain new biological insights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we performed the knowledge enrichment analysis for 17,343 genes in 84 human tissues using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Hypergeometric Analysis (HA) against three biological ontologies: Gene Ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>), KEGG pathways and Disease Ontology (DO) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyses results demonstrated that the functions of most gene groups are consistent with their tissue origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile three interesting new associations for HK genes and the skeletal muscle tissue genes are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Firstly, Hypergeometric analysis against KEGG database for HK genes disclosed that three disease terms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>) are intensively enriched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, Hypergeometric analysis against the KEGG database for Skeletal Muscle tissue genes shows that two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM)" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC)" are heavily enriched, which are also considered as no relationship with skeletal functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, "<z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate cancer</z:hpo>" is intensively enriched in Hypergeometric analysis against the disease ontology (DO) for the Skeletal Muscle tissue genes, which is a much unexpected phenomenon </plain></SENT>
