<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> with MVO and elevated intraventricular pressure gradients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Briefly, this case presents an unusual clinical scenario where a young pregnant woman suffering from hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> hemodynamic compromise related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> illustrating hemodynamic challenges created by pregnancy and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that simple measures such as communication between the cardiology and obstetric teams, understanding of the hemodynamic changes, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> planning, and monitoring were paramount for the success in our patient </plain></SENT>
