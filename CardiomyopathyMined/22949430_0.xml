<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -Sarcomere mutations cause both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), however the steps leading from mutation to disease are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By studying mutation carriers before a clinical diagnosis develops, we characterize the early manifestations of sarcomere mutations in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and investigate how these manifestations differ from sarcomere mutations associated with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -Sixty-two genotyped individuals in families with sarcomeric <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> underwent clinical evaluation including strain echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group included 12 subclinical <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutation carriers with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac dimensions and ejection fraction (LVEFâ‰¥55%), 21 overt <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> subjects, and 29 related mutation (-) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared to a previously characterized cohort of 60 subclinical HCM subjects (sarcomere mutation carriers without LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic myocardial tissue velocity, longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain, and longitudinal and radial strain rate were reduced by 10-23% in subclinical <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutation carriers compared to controls (p&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons), after adjusting for age and family relations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in diastolic parameters were identified comparing the subclinical and control cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The opposite pattern of contractile abnormalities with reduced diastolic but preserved systolic function was seen in subclinical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Subtle abnormalities in systolic function are present in subclinical <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutation carriers, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV size and EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, impaired relaxation and preserved systolic function appear to be the predominant early manifestations of sarcomere mutations that lead to HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the theory that the mutation's intrinsic impact on sarcomere function influences whether a dilated or hypertrophic phenotype develops </plain></SENT>
