<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Indications for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) are based on left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), although LVEF has limited ability to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that strain echocardiography can predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether strain echocardiography may help in the risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four patients with nonischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By speckle-tracking strain echocardiography, global longitudinal strain was calculated as the average of peak longitudinal strain from a 16-segment LV model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time interval from electrocardiographic peak R to peak negative strain was assessed in each LV segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dispersion was defined as the standard deviation of time to peak negative strain from 16 LV segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median of 22 months of follow-up (range, 1-46 months), 12 patients (13%) had experienced arrhythmic events, defined as sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVEF and global longitudinal strain were reduced in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with arrhythmic events compared with those without (28 ± 10% vs 38 ± 13%, P = .01, and -6.4 ± 3.3% vs -12.3 ± 5.2%, P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Global longitudinal strain showed greater area under the curve than LVEF to identify arrhythmic events in receiver operating characteristic curve analyses (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with arrhythmic events had increased mechanical dispersion (98 ± 43 vs 56 ± 18 ms, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dispersion predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> independently of LVEF (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.49; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Global longitudinal strain is a promising marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dispersion predicted arrhythmic events in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> independently of LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Strain echocardiography may help in the risk stratification of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> not fulfilling current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications </plain></SENT>
