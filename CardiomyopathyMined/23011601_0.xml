<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past years, mutations in desmosomal genes have been identified as disease-causative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and variable phenotypic expression alongside with diverse disease progression still render the evaluation of its prognostic implication difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ARVC was initially entered into the canon of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> of the World Health Organization in 1995, and international efforts have resulted in the 2010 modified diagnostic criteria for ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> additional insights into pathophysiology, clinical management, and modern risk stratification, under-/misdiagnosing of ARVC remains a problem and hampers reliable statements on the incidence, prevalence, and natural course of the disease.This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ARVC and sheds some light on potential new developments in these areas </plain></SENT>
