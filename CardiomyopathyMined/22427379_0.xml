<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the implication of microRNAs (miRNAs) in HF, we investigated their regulation and potential role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>miRNA expression profiles were measured in left ventricle biopsies from 10 diabetic HF (D-HF) and 19 nondiabetic HF (ND-HF) patients affected by non-end stage dilated ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HF groups were compared with each other and with 16 matched nondiabetic, non-HF control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 miRNAs were modulated in D-HF and/or ND-HF patients when compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>miR-216a, strongly increased in both D-HF and ND-HF patients, negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six miRNAs were differently expressed when comparing D-HF and ND-HF patients: miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-199b, miR-210, miR-650, and miR-223 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic analysis of their modulated targets showed the enrichment of cardiac dysfunctions and HF categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor pathway was activated in the noninfarcted, vital myocardium of D-HF compared with ND-HF patients, indicating a dysregulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> response mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, miR-199a, miR-199b, and miR-210 were modulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells cultured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings show a dysregulation of miRNAs in HF, shedding light on the specific disease mechanisms differentiating diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
