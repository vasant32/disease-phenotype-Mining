<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the clinical and molecular characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> in patients with mutations affecting genes coding for proteins with role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 2002 and 2011, 101 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> and a molecularly confirmed RASopathy were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital heart defects</z:hpo> within the spectrum of complete or partial (including cleft mitral valve) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> were diagnosed in 8/101 (8%) patients, including seven with a PTPN11 gene mutation, and one single subject with a RAF1 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only recurrent mutation was the missense PTPN11 c.124â€‰A&gt;G change (T42A) in PTPN11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011577'>Partial atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> was found in six cases, complete in one, cleft mitral valve in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four subjects the defect was associated with other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subvalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, mitral valve anomaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary valve stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal segregation of PTPN11 and RAF1 gene mutations occurred in two and one patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital heart defects</z:hpo> in the affected relatives were discordant in the families with PTPN11 mutations, and concordant in that with RAF1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data confirm previous reports indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> represents a relatively common feature in Noonan syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among RASopathies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> was observed to occur with higher prevalence among subjects with PTPN11 mutations, even though this association was not significant possibly because of low statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Familial segregation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> should be considered in the genetic counselling of families with RASopathies.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 11 July 2012; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.145 </plain></SENT>
