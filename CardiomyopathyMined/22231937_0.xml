<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Novel imaging methods have shown that stress-induced cavity dilation and myocardial wall abnormalities can be a reflection of underlying previous exaggerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive episodes</z:e> due to sympathetic overdrive, which results in microvascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
