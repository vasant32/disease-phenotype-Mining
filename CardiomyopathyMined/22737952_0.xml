<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of signs and symptoms is very wide, the usual non-invasive tests lack specificity and the myocardial biopsy is only performed in a minority of cases to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to its unique ability to directly image <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is now considered the primary tool for noninvasive assessment of patients with suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMR is also useful for monitoring disease activity under treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>Myocarditis</z:mp> has been associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; CMR could play a role in the follow-up of such cases to detect the progression toward a dilatative phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Precise mapping of myocardial lesions with cardiac MRI is invaluable to guide myocardial biopsy and increase its diagnostic yield by improving sensitivity </plain></SENT>
