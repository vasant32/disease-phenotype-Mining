<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, the high resulting afterload can lead to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with percutaneous balloon atrioseptostomy used in this circumstance to discharge the left heart and prevent worsening <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2002 and December 2009, 5 patients, with a mean age of 39 years, who were under peripheral ECLS underwent percutaneous balloon atrioseptostomy for refractory worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> as determined by clinical, radiological, and echocardiographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial dysfunction was related to drug poisoning in 2 cases and to <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> in the 3 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrioseptostomy successfully improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> and echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients were eventually discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient died in hospital due to multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, percutaneous balloon atrioseptostomy appeared to be a rapid, effective, and minimally invasive technique for offloading the left heart of patients with a reversible cardiac dysfunction under ECLS and suffering from refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
