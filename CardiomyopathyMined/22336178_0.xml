<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, GLA mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> lysosomal storage disorder, may also present with isolated HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As HCM genetic testing panels are increasingly being used clinically, variants of unknown significance (VUS) are encountered, leading to challenges in interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present an illustrative case: a 10-year-old girl with isolated HCM who, on testing with a HCM multi-gene panel, was found to carry a maternally inherited p.W24R variant in GLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attempts to evaluate the significance of this variant, by direct biochemical testing of patient specimens, gave inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent in vitro protein expression studies suggested that the variant is unlikely to be pathogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case highlights diagnostic dilemmas that can be provoked by VUS in general, and specifically raises a question whether GLA sequencing should be included in first-line diagnostic testing for female children with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
