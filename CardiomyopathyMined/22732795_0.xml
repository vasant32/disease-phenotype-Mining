<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a multifactorial disease that includes both hereditary and acquired forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that around 20-35% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> have hereditary forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is the third most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and the most common cause of heart transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can be a secondary condition of many diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>, ingestion of toxic substances (alcohol, cocaine), ingestion of chemotherapeutic drugs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, we aimed to describe the changes of myocardial cells and interstitial connective tissue in patients clinically diagnosed with alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The material studied consisted of heart fragments sampled from the left ventricle (LV) during necropsy from a total of 28 patients, aged between 58 and 73 years, with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, hospitalized in the Cardiology Center of the Emergency County Hospital of Craiova in 2009 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, myocardial muscle fibers appeared slightly elongated or wavy, with hypochromatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, vacuolar sarcoplasm, by a decrease of myofibril numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lipofuscin granules were frequently seen in the sarcoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nuclear changes were consistent with sarcoplasmic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes of the interstitial connective tissue were sometimes extensive and sometimes barely noticeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common alteration of this structure was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and development of a mainly perivascular collagen fibrillogenetic process </plain></SENT>
