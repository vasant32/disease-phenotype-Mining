<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 20 years ago, mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins were identified as the cause of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are limitations to current clinical application, genetic testing can identify the specific gene mutation responsible for causing HCM in patients and their family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This provides a definitive means to identify at-risk relatives, as well as new opportunities to study pathogenesis, and developing novel strategies for disease prevention and modification </plain></SENT>
