<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In accordance to several studies, it appears to be the most effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotic drug</z:chebi> for treatment-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> appears to be particularly beneficial in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> who are suicidal and in those with comorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038586" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="AODD">substance use disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, despite its efficacy, the general use of <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> in clinical practice is somewhat limited because of the risk of several serious adverse effects such as <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the FDA and the drug's manufacturer have strengthened warnings to include that a potentially fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> may occur when taking <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present paper the literature on <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi>-related myocardis will be reviewed and practical advice will be given concerning the diagnosis and management of such potentially fatal adverse effect </plain></SENT>
