<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that an elevated heart rate would herald <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective case-control study was performed with 55 DMD boys and 150 age-matched control boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variables were age, heart rate, shortening fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was defined as a shortening fraction less than 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DMD boys had a higher initial heart rate with no baseline echocardiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control subjects showed a statistically significant age-related decline in heart rate (p = 0.001) but not the DMD boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> developed in 17 of the 55 DMD boys over a period of 4.6 ± 1.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DMD upper and lower heart rate groups were similar in age, follow-up time, and initial shortening fraction, yet <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> developed in 14 (42%) of 33 upper quartile boys but only 3 (14%) of 22 lower quartile DMD boys (odds ratio, 6.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-18.92; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control subjects, the DMD boys had a higher resting heart rate and a lack of age-related heart rate decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DMD boys in the upper heart rate quartile were more likely to progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> than those in the lower quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study establishes heart rate elevation as a statistically significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies may define heart rate cutoffs for early pharmacologic intervention for incipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
