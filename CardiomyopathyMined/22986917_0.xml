<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>If we look at myocardial dysfunction from the perspective of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patient, there are a few questions to be asked: What causes myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What is the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Is there something that could be done to prevent the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of these questions is interrelated and the answers will be more easily addressed if we continue to understand the basic mechanisms that are implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The principal mechanisms proposed for the pathogenesis of myocardial dysfunction support a prominent role for functional rather than anatomical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, attempts to reduce the high mortality in septic patients by manipulating the functional alterations have provided limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the concept of septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has evolved, which implies alterations in the myocardial phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review includes an overview on the activation of the immune system and therapeutic approaches in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, myocardial structural changes in the human septic heart, experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and cellular, molecular and functional myocardial changes seen in a variety of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abnormal parameters discussed may emerge as therapeutic targets, for which modulation might provide beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcome and mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in the future </plain></SENT>
