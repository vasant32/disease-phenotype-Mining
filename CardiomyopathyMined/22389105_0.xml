<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their clearance relies on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and their concentration increases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of NT-proBNP and BNP in 248 patients with AL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> with different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to GFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 comprised 109 patients with GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , Group 2, 77 subjects with GFR &lt;60 and ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , and Group 3, 62 patients with GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to detect heart involvement and to predict survival in the three groups was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreasing eGFR required higher cutoffs of both NT-proBNP and BNP for detecting heart involvement and predicting survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were independent prognostic markers in Groups 1 and 2, whereas in Group 3 only BNP independently predicted survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are powerful and useful markers of cardiac dysfunction and prognosis, provided that eGFR is considered in interpreting their clinical meaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BNP should be preferred in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
