<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> provoke changes in ECG and echocardiography (echo) at an early stage when clinical symptoms are absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ECG and echo data and their relationship to fitness peculiar to top handball players have never been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 291 male first league handball players (32 Olympians/47 national players) (25.3±4.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Check up consisted of ECG, spiroergometry and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None had T-wave inversions, 3.1% showed early repolarisation abnormalities in the precordial leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sokolow-Lyon voltage criterion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was positive in 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spiroergometry showed a maximum oxygen uptake (peakVO2) of 50.3±7.7 ml/min/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVmass was increased in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between peakVO2 and LVindex (p&lt;0.001, r=0.341), (LVmass/peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> p=0.053, r=0.125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A relationship between cardiac dimensions and peakVO2 could not be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In professional handball players early repolarisation abnormalities were less frequent and LVmass was increased when compared with soccer players </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The need for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for different types of sports is crucial to guarantee a proper evaluation of athletes </plain></SENT>
