<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To establish quicker <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and less myocardial distension injury during heart procurement, we combined St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thomas and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solutions for donor heart preservation since June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2008 to March 2010, we enrolled 31 heart transplantation (HT) patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During heart procurement we initially infused 1,000 mL cold St Thomas cardioplegic solution to achieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After procurement, a further 2,000 mL of cold HTK solution was infused at low perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 1,000 mL cold HTK solution was perfused before donor heart implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined donor age, recipient preoperative characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time, hospital stay, postoperative graft function, major cardiac events, and transplant vasculopathy (TCAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (71.0%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 7 (23.3%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 23 (76.7%) male donors, and the mean donor age was 38.4 ± 13.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent a redo sternotomy, 1 patient needed a third-do sternotomy, and 1 a seventh sternotomy (third HT) for repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time was 224.9 ± 71.0 minutes and the postoperative hospital stay was 57.7 ± 47.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The surgical mortality (3.2%) was not accompanied by hospital or follow-up mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient left ventricular ejection fraction postoperative was 59.6 ± 2.3% with good functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Major cardiac events occurred in 8 patients (26.7%) without major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were two subjects with TCAD but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> graft function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time and hospital stay was insignificant (r = 0.21; P = .26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Donor heart preservation combining St Thomas cardioplegic arest and low-pressure perfusion with HTK solution seemed to be safe with </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>short-term survival similar to other approaches </plain></SENT>
