<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> has been reported in up to 25-39% of patients and is responsible for up to 85% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to the disease, often due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An established diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> (CS) portends an ominous prognosis, with an estimated five year-survival of 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case that was initially diagnosed as arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVD/C), but extra-cardiac biopsies later on were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> and a final diagnosis of CS was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) with a subcutaneous lead array implant for high defibrillation threshold (DFT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusive right ventricular (RV) involvement is atypical for CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant RV involvement based on echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and right precordial electrocardiogram changes can lead to misdiagnosis as ARVD/C based on the modified task force criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> is an under-diagnosed disease and the delay in its diagnosis and appropriate therapy can lead to a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High defibrillation thresholds have not been previously reported in patients with CS, but given the natural progression of the disease and the limitations in current pharmacotherapy, implanters who diagnose and treat such patients must be prepared to deal with this issue </plain></SENT>
