<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of morphological cardiac changes depends on a variety of factors, namely body size, gender, type of sport, ethnicity and, likely, genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of male athletes engaged in intense endurance sports, such as cycling and rowing, develops a more substantial increase in left ventricular dimensions that may overlap with the phenotypic expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A common clinical challenge in sports cardiology is the differential diagnosis between physiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (i.e., "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e>") and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which is one of the most common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in young athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review describes the physiological determinants, characteristics and upper limits of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> in athletes, and analyzes the criteria that can be useful in the differential diagnosis between "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e>" and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
