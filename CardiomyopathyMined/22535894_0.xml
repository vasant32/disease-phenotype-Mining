<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When released to the matrix, matricellular proteins associate with growth factors, cytokines, and other bioactive effectors and bind to cell surface receptors transducing signaling cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Matricellular proteins are upregulated in the injured and remodeling heart and play an important role in regulation of inflammatory, reparative, fibrotic and angiogenic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombospondin (TSP)-1, -2, and -4 as well as tenascin-C and -X secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), osteopontin, periostin, and members of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="15862">CCN</z:chebi> family (including CCN1 and CCN2/connective tissue growth factor) are involved in a variety of cardiac pathophysiological conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, aging-associated myocardial remodeling, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the properties and characteristics of the matricellular proteins and presents our current knowledge on their role in cardiac adaptation and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Understanding the role of matricellular proteins in myocardial pathophysiology and identification of the functional domains responsible for their actions may lead to design of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with therapeutic potential for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
