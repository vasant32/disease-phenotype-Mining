<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the associations among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, ventricular geometry, and physiologic measures of myocardial performance remain to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of patients with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IC (LV ejection fraction ≤50%) who underwent CMR imaging from 2004 to 2010 and had plasma B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) measured within 14 days of the CMR study was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 patients met the criteria (mean age 66 ± 10 years; 31 men [82%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of IC was 67 ± 69 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CMR characteristics included LV dilation (LV end-diastolic dimension 62 ± 8 mm) and severe systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction 28 ± 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average quantitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> was 20 ± 12% of the LV mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stratified by fibrotic mass, increased myocardial scar size was associated with increased LV cavity size (p = 0.007), lower LV ejection fraction (p = 0.04), and higher BNP (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, when stratified by median BNP (475 pg/ml), an elevated BNP level was associated, not only with LV size, function, and degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, but also with increased meridional wall stress (p = 0.002) and worse New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IC, quantitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is associated with CMR structural and functional <z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>LV abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated BNP levels are related to high-risk structural and functional CMR abnormalities and wall stress and functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> appears to be related to plasma BNP through the processes of ventricular remodeling </plain></SENT>
