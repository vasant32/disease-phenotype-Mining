<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T-wave inversion on a 12-lead ECG is usually dismissed in young people as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persistence of the juvenile pattern of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, T-wave inversion is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which are leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed the prevalence, age relation, and underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> of T-wave inversion in children undergoing preparticipation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 2765 consecutive Italian children (1914 male participants; mean age, 13.9±2.2 years; range 8-18 years) undergoing preparticipation screening including an ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 229 children (8%) who underwent further evaluation because of positive findings at initial preparticipation screening, 33 (1.2%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-wave inversion was recorded in 158 children (5.7%) and was localized in the right precordial leads in 131 (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of right precordial T-wave inversion decreased significantly with increasing age (8.4% in children &lt;14 years of age versus 1.7% in those ≥14 years; P&lt;0.001), pubertal development (9.5% of children with incomplete versus 1.6% with complete development; P&lt;0.001), and body mass index below the 10th percentile (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incomplete pubertal development was the only independent predictor for right precordial T-wave inversion (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.8; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 158 children with T-wave inversion, 4 (2.5%) had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T-wave inversion decreases significantly after puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic investigation of children with postpubertal persistence of T-wave inversion at preparticipation screening is warranted because it may lead to presymptomatic diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> during sports </plain></SENT>
