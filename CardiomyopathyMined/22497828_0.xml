<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanism for alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiac effects of alcohol were examined in mice feeding with alcohol or isocaloric control diet for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signaling pathways of alcohol-induced cardiac cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were examined in H9c2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, hearts from alcohol-fed mice exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp>, along with significant nitrative damage, demonstrated by 3-nitrotyrosine abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcohol exposure to H9c2 cells induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, accompanied by 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> oxidase (NOX) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation of H9c2 cells with urate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> scavenger), N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>(III) tetrakis(1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-pyridyl)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> (a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase mimetic), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> (NOX inhibitor) abrogated alcohol-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, alcohol exposure significantly increased the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and its type 1 receptor (AT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A protein kinase C (PKC)-α/β1 inhibitor or PKC-β1 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and an AT1 blocker prevented alcohol-induced activation of NOX, and the AT1 blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the expression of PKC-β1, indicating that alcohol-induced activation of NOX is mediated by PKC-β1 via AT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To define the role of AT1-mediated PKC/NOX-derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation in alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity, mice with knockout of the AT1 gene and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were simultaneously treated with alcohol for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The knockout AT1 gene completely prevented cardiac nitrative damage, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, remodeling, and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More importantly, pharmacological treatment of alcoholic mice with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase mimetic also significantly prevented cardiac nitrative damage, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-induced nitrative stress and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which are mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> interaction with AT1 and subsequent activation of a PKC-β1-dependent NOX pathway, are a causal factor in the development of alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
