<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings and determine the prognostic variables in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMR imaging was performed in 91 patients (58% men, mean age 43 ± 18 years, and mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose of 276 ± 82 mg/m(2)) with a reduced ejection fraction after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, and admission for decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients presented a median of 88 months (interquartile range 37 to 138) after chemotherapy and were followed for 27 months (interquartile range 22 to 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was an uncommon finding (5 patients, 6%) despite a reduced ejection fraction (36 ± 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An inverse association was found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose and the indexed left ventricular (LV) mass by CMR (r = -0.67, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 52 adverse cardiac events occurred (event rate of 22%/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of a major adverse cardiovascular event, the indexed LV mass and glomerular filtration rate were lower and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose was greater among the patients who experienced an adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, the indexed LV mass demonstrated the strongest association with major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.89, chi-square 26, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, myocardial scar by late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement-CMR is infrequent in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> despite a reduced ejection fraction, the event rate in patients with established <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-cardiotoxicity is high, and indexed LV mass by CMR imaging is a predictor of adverse cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
