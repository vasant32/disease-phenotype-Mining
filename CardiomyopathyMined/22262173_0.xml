<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively little attention has been paid to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> processes in mammals although a decline of differentiated functions and acquisition of immature, "embryonic" properties is seen in various disease processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Dedifferentiation</z:e> of parenchymal cells in mammals might serve multiple purposes including (1) facilitation of tissue regeneration by generation of progenitor-like cells and (2) protection of cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> by reduction of ATP consumption due to changes in energy metabolism and/or inactivation of energy-intensive "specialized" functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently found that an inflammatory cytokine of the interleukin 6 family, oncostatin M (OSM), initiates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> of cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, activation of the OSM signaling pathway protects the heart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> but has a negative impact when continuously activated thereby promoting dilative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strong presence of the OSM receptor on cardiomyocytes and the unique features of the OSM signaling circuit suggest a major role of OSM for cardiac protection and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that continuous activation or malfunctions of the cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> machinery might contribute to different disease conditions </plain></SENT>
