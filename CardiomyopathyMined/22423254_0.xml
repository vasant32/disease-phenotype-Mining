<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on native <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp>, its relation with left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling and the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs).Methods and resultsIn this prospective study, we included 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> in sinus rhythm (25 male; 16 with ischaemic aetiology; aged 62.7 ± 9.5 years; New York Heart Association class II-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters and <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after implantation of CRT device combined with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-wave amplitude variability was determined by a 20-min high-resolution electrocardiogram Holter recording during native conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> assessment, patients were monitored for 15.7 ± 5.2 months for the occurrence of VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decrease in median <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> [from 40.45 μV (24.75-56.00) to 28.15 μV (20.93-37.95), P = 0.004] was observed after 6 months of CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, decrease of median <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> was only noticed in patients with LV reverse remodelling [46.9 μV (27.5-70.0) to 25.8 μV (20.2-32.4), P &lt; 0.001] and in patients without VTs [40.5 μV (27.5-55.9) to 24.4 μV (17.1-31.5), P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Native median <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> &gt; 35.4 µV after 6 months of CRT had an 83% sensitivity and 93% specificity for predicting the occurrence of VTs.ConclusionsDecrease of <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> after CRT is associated with LV reverse remodelling and indicates a reduction of the intrinsic arrhythmogenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median <z:mp ids='MP_0010594'>TAV</z:mp> after CRT had a good predicting value for VT occurrence in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
