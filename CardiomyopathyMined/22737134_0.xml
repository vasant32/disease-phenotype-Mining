<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardinal manifestations are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and seldom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins and their interaction partners have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVC and it is now widely accepted that ARVC is a disease caused by abnormal cell-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) by which mutations in desmosomal proteins lead to fibro-fatty replacement remains to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this aim over the last 10â€‰years different transgenic and targeted mouse models have been developed, these models and what they have taught us will be discussed in this review </plain></SENT>
