<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the geometric pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (HT) in patients with asymmetrical septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and to test the hypothesis that at least in some patients, the HT follows a longitudinal spiral pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotypic expression of HCM is a well-known phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CMR has emerged as a robust 3-dimensional (3D) tomographic imaging technique that is increasingly used to explore phenotypic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Short-axis cine CMR was used to study the 3D extent of HT (i.e., radial, circumferential, and longitudinal extent, as well as the relation between circumferential and longitudinal extent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were septal wall thickness (WT) ≥15 mm and septal to free wall WT ratio &gt;1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CMR was performed in 132 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal WT was 22 ± 5 mm, with a circumferential extent of 131 ± 51°, and a longitudinal extent of 64 ± 19%, resulting in a hypertrophied left ventricular (LV) surface of 26 ± 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis showed in 86% of patients a consistent course of HT along the longitudinal direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HT invariably started at the basal anteroseptum and rotated, except in 2 patients, in a counterclockwise direction (CC-spiral patients) with a mean global rotation of 116 ± 68° (range 5° to 350°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the CC-spiral patients were divided according to magnitude of rotation quartiles (Q1: 5° to 70°, Q2: 75° to 105°, Q3: 110° to 150°, and Q4: 155° to 350°), Q4 patients were significantly older and had more LV outflow tract obstruction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than patients without the spiraling pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients, continuation of HT into an apical form of HCM was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using 3D analysis, we found that the majority of patients with asymmetrical septal HCM in fact showed a spiral pattern of HT following a counterclockwise (or "left-handed") spiral trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The variation in magnitude of rotation among patients, however, was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted to better understand the significance of the current findings, in particular to relate them to the genetic and morphological substrate, hemodynamic consequences, and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
