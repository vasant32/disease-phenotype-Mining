<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> remains unclear, improving cardiac muscle Ca(2+) sensitivity through either pharmacological or genetic approaches shows promise of alleviating the disease-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to its central role as the Ca(2+) sensor for cardiac muscle contraction, troponin C (TnC) stands out as an obvious and versatile target to reset disease-associated myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity back to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that aberrant myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and its related function can be corrected through rationally engineered TnC constructs, three thin filament protein modifications representing different proteins (troponin I or troponin T), modifications (missense mutation, deletion, or truncation), and disease subtypes (familial or acquired) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fluorescent TnC was utilized to measure Ca(2+) binding to TnC in the physiologically relevant biochemical model system of reconstituted thin filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the pathophysiology, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutation, troponin I R192H, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced truncation of troponin I (residues 1-192) increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of TnC on the thin filament, whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> mutation, troponin T Î”K210, decreased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of TnC on the thin filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rationally engineered TnC constructs corrected the abnormal Ca(2+) sensitivities of the thin filament, reconstituted actomyosin ATPase activity, and force generation in skinned trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present study provides a novel and versatile therapeutic strategy to restore diseased cardiac muscle Ca(2+) sensitivity </plain></SENT>
