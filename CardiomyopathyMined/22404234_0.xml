<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This paper aims to review the case of a girl who presented with a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo>, in addition to unusual skin, nail and hair conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tragically an undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case is discussed with reference to a number of dermatological and oral conditions which were considered as possible diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: AW had been under long term dental care for prepubertal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">root resorption</z:e> of primary teeth, soft tissue and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo>, and angular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separately she had also been seen by several dermatologists with respect to palmar plantar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001065'>striae</z:hpo> keratoderma, wiry hair and abnormal finger nails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tragically the patient suffered a sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the subsequent post mortem identified an undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most likely diagnosis is that this case is a variant of Carvajal Syndrome with additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To date we have been unable to identify mutations in the desoplakin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We aim to emphasise the importance of recognising these dental and dermatological signs when they present together as a potential risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
