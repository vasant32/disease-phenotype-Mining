<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic etiology in ARVC patients is most commonly caused by dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though histological examinations of ARVC-affected human myocardium reveals fibrolipomatous replacement, the molecular mechanisms leading to loss of cardiomyocytes are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore analyzed the transcriptomes of six ARVC hearts and compared our findings to six nonfailing donor hearts (NF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To characterize the ARVC-specific transcriptome, we compared our findings to samples from seven patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myocardial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and ARVC samples were prepared from hearts explanted during an orthotopic heart transplantation representing myocardium from end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients (NYHA IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From each heart, left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial samples were analyzed by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, adding up to six sample groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised cluster analyses of the groups revealed a clear separation of NF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to the other samples, the analyses revealed no distinct expression pattern in LV and RV of myocardial ARVC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further identified differentially expressed transcripts using t-tests and found transcripts separating diseased and NF ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of note, in failing myocardium only ~15-16% of the genes are commonly regulated compared with NF samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> are clearly distinct on the transcriptome level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the expression patterns between the failing RV and LV using a paired t-test revealed a lack of major differences between LV and RV gene expression in ARVC hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first analysis of specific ARVC-related RV and LV gene expression patterns in terminal failing human hearts </plain></SENT>
