<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, myocardial metabolism is 60-80% reliant on the oxidation of fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This can be modified by conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or poisoning with specific drugs, with the myocardium becoming more dependent on carbohydrate metabolism for energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> poisoning with cardiotoxic drugs may be complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> that is at present usually treated by inotropic drugs and vasopressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, changes in metabolic processes in poisoning may offer an opportunity for novel therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CURRENT EVIDENCE: The scientific evidence obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion models and the preservation of myocardial metabolism when myocardial blood flow is restored after a brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> (a theory known as "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e>") support this concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generalized or localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e> may develop in patients who do not present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, a condition referred to as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is characterized by the preservation of myocardial blood flow, associated with a depressed myocardial contractility, lasting from hours to weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS: Several factors have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>:- excessive sympathetic stimulation, either from exogenous or endogenous origin; drug poisoning or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The metabolism of both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fatty acids appears to be reduced in the hypocontractile areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the hypotheses is that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-mediated myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> may be responsible for reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the drugs taken in overdose, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> and beta-blockers have been shown to influence myocardial metabolism, with a shift from fatty acids to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the rationale for the administration of insulin in order to stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> myocardial uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin at high doses seems also to have inotropic effects, which are independent from its effects on myocardial substrate handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Better understanding of the relationship between the receptor interactions of myocardial toxins and their effects on myocardial metabolism is likely to result in the development of new targeted therapies aimed specifically at optimising metabolic processes in poisoning </plain></SENT>
