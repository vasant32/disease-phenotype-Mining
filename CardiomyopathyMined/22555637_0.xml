<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features and long-term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TIC) have not been well described in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at our institution of patients with a diagnosis of TIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with pure TIC and 12 patients with impure TIC were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DCMO), pure TIC patients were less symptomatic, as judged by NYHA class (p = 0.02), they had fewer clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (p = 0.007) and were more likely to report <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> (p = 0.007) at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographically, pure TIC patients had fewer Q waves (p = 0.002), less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) (p = 0.004) and repolarisation abnormalities (p = 0.048), and shorter QRS durations (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographically, pure TIC patients had significantly smaller left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd) ( p &lt; 0.001), ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) (p = 0.001) and left atrial dimensions (p = 0.048) at presentation compared to DCMO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with pure TIC had a trend towards increased residual LVIDd dimensions compared to a control group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiograms, indicating a persistence of adverse LV remodelling late after control of the causative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> occurred in three patients, which resulted in a precipitous decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare features of pure and impure TIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with pure TIC had shorter QRS durations, fewer Q waves, and less LVH and repolarisation abnormalities at presentation compared to DCMO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TIC patients tended to have smaller LVIDd dimensions at presentation and have persistence of adverse LV remodelling, as characterised by persistent enlargement of LVIDd dimensions, at late follow up </plain></SENT>
