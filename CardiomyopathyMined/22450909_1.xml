<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These molecules, apparently together with some specific cytoskeletal proteins, are components of (or interact with) composite junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Composite junctions contain the amalgamated fusion products of the molecules that, in other cell types and tissues, occur in distinct separate junctions, i.e. desmosomes and adherens junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the pertinent literature is still in an expanding phase and is obviously becoming important for various groups of researchers in basic cell and molecular biology, developmental biology, histology, <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, cardiology, pathology and genetics, the relevant references so far recognized have been collected and are presented here in the following order: desmocollin-2 (Dsc2, DSC2), desmoglein-2 (Dsg2, DSG2), desmoplakin (DP, DSP), plakoglobin (PG, JUP), plakophilin-2 (Pkp2, PKP2) and some non-desmosomal proteins such as transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2 (RYR2), desmin, lamins A and C, striatin, titin and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGFβ3), followed by a collection of animal models and of reviews, commentaries, collections and comparative studies </plain></SENT>
