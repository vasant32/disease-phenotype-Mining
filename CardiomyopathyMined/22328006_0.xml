<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports on single cardiomyocyte experiments suggested that out of two enantiomers, RR and SS, that constitute a racemic mixture of fenoterol, only RR-enantiomer is an active component that might be a promising new drug for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the RR enantiomer of fenoterol with efficacy of racemic fenoterol, and SS, an inactive enantiomer, in whole animal experimental models of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two weeks after induction of MI by permanent ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery early cardiac remodeling and MI size were assessed via echocardiography and rats were divided into treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment (placebo, racemic fenoterol, RR- or SS-enantiomers of fenoterol) continued for 6 months while progression of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was followed by serial echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with untreated rats, rats treated with racemic fenoterol demonstrated previously described attenuation of LV remodeling, functional decline and the arrest of the MI expansion during the first 2 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the treatment with either RR-, or with SS-enantiomers of fenoterol was completely ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The conclusion drawn on the basis of previous experiments with single cardiomyocytes that RR-enantiomer of fenoterol represents an active component of racemic fenoterol and can be further investigated as a new drug for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was not confirmed in the whole animal model of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
