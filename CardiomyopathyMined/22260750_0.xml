<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of congenitally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> in patients having cardiac transplantation (CT) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 243 explanted hearts in patients having CT at Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas from June 1997 through November 2011 to determine the frequency of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 243 explanted hearts, 7 (2.9%) were found to have a congenitally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>: 3 had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> and before CT had had the aortic valve replaced; the other 4 had normally functioning bicuspid valves and underwent CT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ischemic in 1, idiopathic in 2, and hypertrophic in 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Review of previously published reports of CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> disclosed that 4 patients had had aortic valve replacement (AVR) from 2 to 8 years before CT, 3 had AVR or aortic valve repair of the donor heart at the time of CT, and 4 had AVR or transcatheter aortic valve implantation from 1 to 14 years after CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these aortic valve replacements, before, at the time of, or after CT were in patients with congenitally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, congenitally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> were found in 7 of 243 explanted hearts in patients having CT at a single medical center in a 14-year period: 4 had functioned normally and 3 were severely stenotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous reports of patients having AVR or repair before, during, and after CT were reviewed </plain></SENT>
