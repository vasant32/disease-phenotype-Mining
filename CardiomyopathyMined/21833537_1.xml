<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CYP2E1 activity and markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and cardiac cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during the development of alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ACM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in left ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were evaluated in 4 groups of chronically instrumented dogs (control; alcohol-receiving; and alcohol-receiving plus treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>) after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CYP2E1 and calpain-1 protein expression were determined by Western blotting, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> evaluated by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25134,50650">Malonyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38124">dialdehyde</z:chebi> levels were assessed as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase levels were evaluated as markers of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of CYP2E1 was increased in the alcohol-receiving group compared with controls (P&lt;0.05) and was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, expression of Bad and calpain-1 protein was increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcohol exposure, while Bcl-xL protein expression remained at a low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bad and calpain-1 protein expressions were significantly inhibited by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>, while expression of Bcl-xL protein was increased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results indicate a possibly significant role for CYP2E1 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resulting increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is accompanied by cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and may ultimately contribute to tissue remodeling and ACM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these alcohol-induced effects may be abrogated by means such as angiotensin 1 receptor blockade or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
