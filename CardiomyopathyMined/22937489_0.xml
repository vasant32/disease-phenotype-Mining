<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously we have characterized the molecular and functional signature of heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>Cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> during pregnancy is a complex process that involves many changes including in the signalling pathways, composition of extracellular matrix as well as the levels of sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review summarises the recent advances and the new frontiers in the context of heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular we focus on structural and extracellular matrix remodelling as well as signalling pathways in pregnancy-induced physiological heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence shows that various microRNAs modulate key components of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, therefore the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in pregnancy induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> is also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also review the role of ubiquitin proteasome system, the major machinery for the degradation of damaged and misfolded proteins, in heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of sex hormones in particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in cardiac remodeling during pregnancy is also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also review pregnancy-induced cardiovascular complications such as peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and how the knowledge from the animal studies may help us to develop new therapeutic strategies for better treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis has to be given to the guidelines on disease management in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
