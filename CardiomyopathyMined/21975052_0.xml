<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This leads to diastolic dysfunction with relative preservation of systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although short axis systolic function is usually preserved in RCM, the long axis systolic function may be severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of diagnosis and information regarding aetiology, extent of myocardial damage, and response to treatment requires imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, differentiation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002563'>constrictive pericarditis</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>) is needed, as only the latter is managed surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is the initial cardiac imaging technique but cannot reliably suggest a tissue diagnosis; although recent advances, especially tissue Doppler imaging and spectral tracking, have improved its ability to differentiate RCM from <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization is the reference standard, but is invasive, two-dimensional, and does not aid myocardial characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a versatile technique providing anatomical, morphological and functional information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In recent years, it has been shown to provide important information regarding disease mechanisms, and also been found useful to guide treatment, assess its outcome and predict patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review describes the CMR features of RCM, appearances in various diseases, its overall role in patient management, and how it compares with other imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
