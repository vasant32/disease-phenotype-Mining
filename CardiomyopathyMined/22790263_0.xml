<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> transfusion therapy causes a progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> that damages many organs including the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that L-type calcium channels play an important role in iron uptake by cardiomyocytes under conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given that beta-adrenergic stimulation significantly enhances L-type calcium current, we hypothesised that beta-adrenergic blocking drugs could reduce the deleterious effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> on the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron overload</z:e> was generated by intraperitoneal injections of iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (1g/kg) administered once a week for 8 weeks in male C57bl/6 mice, while <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> was administered in drinking water at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function and ventricular remodelling were evaluated by echocardiography and histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared to placebo, iron injection caused cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, myocardial function and ventricular geometry in the iron-treated mice resulted unchanged as compared to those in the placebo-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> increased cardiac performance in iron-overloaded mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, as compared to the values in the iron-overloaded group, in iron-overloaded animals treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> left ventricular fractional shortening increased (from 31.6% to 44.2%, P=0.01) whereas left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased (from 4.1±0.1 mm to 3.5±0.1 mm, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">Propranolol</z:chebi> did not alter cardiac systolic function or left ventricular sizes in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that C57bl/6 mice are resistant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>-induced myocardial injury and that treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> is able to increase cardiac performance in iron-overloaded mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, since C57bl/6 mice were resistant to iron-induced injury, it remains to be evaluated further whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> could prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron-overload</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
