<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, numerous mutations are known in more than 40 genes, which account for around 20% of familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structured evaluation of family history with recording of a family tree is an obligatory part of the initial diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By evaluation of family members other persons at risk can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the lamin A/C gene (LMNA), genetic testing does not allow risk stratification </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This applies with some restrictions for asymptomatic patients in NYHA class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients should receive optimal drug therapy for 3-12 months before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
