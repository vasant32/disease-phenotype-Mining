<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the most severe presentations of the disease are those in families heterozygous for the mutation R403Q in β-cardiac myosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice heterozygous for this mutation in the α-cardiac myosin isoform display typical familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we study cardiomyocytes from heterozygous 403/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of the R403Q mutation on force-generating capabilities and dynamics of cardiomyocytes were investigated using a dual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50814">carbon nanofiber</z:chebi> technique to measure single-cell parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the Frank-Starling effect at the single cardiomyocyte level by showing that cell stretch causes an increase in amplitude of contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant 403/+ cardiomyocytes exhibit higher end-diastolic and end-systolic stiffness than +/+ cardiomyocytes, whereas active force generation capabilities remain unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 403/+ cardiomyocytes show slowed relaxation dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes are consistent with increased end-diastolic and end-systolic chamber elastance, as well as diastolic dysfunction seen at the level of the whole heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that these functional effects of the R403Q mutation are cell-intrinsic, a property that may be a general phenomenon in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
