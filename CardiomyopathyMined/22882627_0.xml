<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Great Danes (GD) are predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), but little is known about progression, clinical manifestations, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> in dogs in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For echocardiographic screening, breed-specific reference intervals (RI) are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in UK GD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish RI for Doppler echocardiography (ECHO) in GD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: One hundred and seven client-owned GDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiographic screening study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dogs were scored on ECHO and ECG variables and classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (NORM), equivocal (EQUIV), or affected (AFX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty NORM dogs were used to determine RI for ECHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pedigrees from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in this population, based on score, was 35.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in M mode left ventricular dimensions (MMLVD) were identified between male and female dogs (P &lt; .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RI for MMLVD and transformed MMLVD (allometric scaling) were lower than previously suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When dogs were reclassified using amended RI for MMLVD, prevalence increased to 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>End-systolic volume index more reliably identified AFX dogs than other systolic function indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) were commonly identified, with the highest prevalence in AFX dogs (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis suggested an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in UK GD is higher than previously reported and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> is likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Sex or body weight-dependent RI should be used for ECHO in GD and current RI might underestimate ESVI in GD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>VA might play an important role in GD with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
