<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> and apical left ventricular dysfunction that resolved after surgical resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo>, to review the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> on myocyte function and the concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TC) is caused by excess <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, and to illustrate the difficulty in the management of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) during a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100735'>hypertensive crisis</z:hpo> attributable to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present the clinical history, physical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies in a 60-year-old man with an ACS, TC, and an incidentaloma later diagnosed to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association with TC and the pertinent literature are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 60-year-old man was suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> on the basis of symptoms of paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> extending to the left shoulder, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001064'>diaphoresis</z:hpo>, ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram, and elevated serial levels of cardiac enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography did not reveal substantial coronary artery obstruction but detected ballooning of the apical, anterior, and inferior cardiac walls, consistent with TC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had a history of labile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> of 3 months' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342500" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal mass</z:e> detected on a prior computed tomographic scan and increased 24-hour urine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels were consistent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with phenoxybenzamine was initiated, and he underwent a right adrenalectomy, which confirmed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> and dramatically improved the patient's condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>Pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> manifest with labile blood pressures and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case also supports the concept that TC is caused by excess <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
