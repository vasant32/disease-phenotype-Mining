<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>, in addition to lowering blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, provides cardioprotection for diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycolysis is essential to cardiac metabolism and its reduction may contribute to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK), rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, are downregulated in cardiac muscle from diabetic subjects, playing a central role on the decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in the heart of diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> modulates heart HK and PFK from diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection on male Swiss mice, which were treated for three consecutive days with 250 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> before evaluating HK and PFK activity, expression, and intracellular distribution on the heart of these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> abrogates the downregulation of HK and PFK in the heart of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is not correlated to alteration on the enzymes' transcription and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the intracellular distribution of both enzymes is altered in diabetic hearts that show increased activity of the soluble fraction when compared to the particulate fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this pattern is reversed upon the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, which is correlated with the effects of the drug on the enzymes activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our results support evidences that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alter the intracellular localization of HK and PFK augmenting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization by diabetic hearts and, thus, conferring cardiac protection to diabetic subjects.
