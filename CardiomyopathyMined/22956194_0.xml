<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Management of HCM in general and HOCM in particular encompasses (1) activity restriction with avoidance of volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, (2) prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, (3) control of symptoms, and (4) screening of relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) should be offered an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic treatment of symptoms in patients with HOCM consists of negative inotropic drugs, namely beta blockers, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">disopyramide</z:chebi>; a nondihydropyridine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> (CCB), usually <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, may be used in patients with noncardiac side-effects of beta blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who have a dual-chamber pacemaker (PM) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> should undergo a trial of pacing with short atrioventricular (AV) delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with intolerable symptoms despite optimal conservative therapy, septal reduction therapy (SRT) should be considered and should be performed by experienced operators in institutions with multidisciplinary HCM programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Younger patients with extreme <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> are usually offered septal myectomy, while older patients, and those with important comorbidities are usually directed to alcohol septal ablation (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients for whom either therapy is appropriate, there should be a balanced discussion with the patients of the benefits and risks of the 2 procedures </plain></SENT>
