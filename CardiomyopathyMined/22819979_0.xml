<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Zinc (Zn) supplementation of animals and humans has been shown to ameliorate <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of Zn in the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by diabetic cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the preventive role of Zn in diabetic cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e> by both in vivo and in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo study revealed a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> ions, and oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and an increase in reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in the developing heart at embryonic days (E) 13.5 and 15.5 in the Zn-supplemented diabetic group when compared to the diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, significantly down-regulated protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of metallothionein (MT) in the developing heart of embryos from diabetic group was rescued by Zn supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the nuclear microscopy results showed that trace elements such as <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, calcium, and Zn levels were significantly increased (P&lt;0.001), whereas the iron level was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) in the developing heart of embryos from the Zn-supplemented diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro study showed a significant increase in cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H9c2 (rat embryonic cardiomyoblast) cells exposed to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supplementation with Zn significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> and reduced the levels of ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>maternal diabetes</z:hpo> could play a role in the development and progression of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e>, and Zn supplementation could be a potential therapy for diabetic cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
