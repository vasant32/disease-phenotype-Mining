<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002108'>spontaneous pneumothorax</z:hpo> was confirmed by chest radiography, a chest tube was inserted into the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persistent air bubbles escaping through the water seal of the drainage in synchrony with respiration indicated a bronchopleural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A physical examination revealed orbital and subconjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skull and chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed further massive cervical, thoracic and pulmonary subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> which are increased subcutaneous amounts of gas which can disperse along the fasciae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardinal sign is the sensation of air under the skin known as subcutaneous crepitation (similiar to touching rice crispies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditions causing subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> are trauma, medical treatment and intracutaneous gas production by bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, large amounts of air leaked out of the pleural space through the incision made for the chest tube into the subcutaneous tissue, mediastinum and retroperitoneum causing subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From there, ascending air spread along the fascial planes of the mediastinum and cervical area through the inferior orbital fissure to the orbits and eyelids causing orbital and subconjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysemas</z:hpo> and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, a second chest tube was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the signs and symptoms disappeared completely </plain></SENT>
