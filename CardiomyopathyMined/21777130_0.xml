<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis utilizing the Florida hospital discharge data linked to vital statistics for 1998 to 2007 (N = 1 738 860) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence rates and trend statistics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression models were used to generate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in pregnancy increased from 8.5/100 000 births to 32.7/100 000 (p for trend &lt;0.0001), representing an absolute increase of 24% and a relative increase of 300% over the decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infants born to women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were at higher risk for feto-infant morbidities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (AOR = 3.49, 95% CI: 2.97-4.11), very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (AOR = 4.43, 95% CI: 2.98-6.60), preterm birth (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI: 2.88-3.85), very preterm birth (AOR = 5.22, 95% CI: 3.92-6.97) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.26-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> during pregnancy over the decade is of concern, as it is related to elevated risk for feto-infant morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a need to delineate risk factors for this condition and to formulate appropriate preconception counseling for women with elevated risk for this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
