<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance allows for the noninvasive assessment of function, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of inflammatory pathways may play an important role in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and may also be involved in the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of our study was to assess the incidence of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> as a marker for myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with nonischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 31 consecutive patients ( mean age, 57 ± 12 years) with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with 39 controls matched for gender and age (mean age, 53 ± 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parameters of left ventricular function and volumes, and electrocardiogram-triggered, T2-weighted, fast spin echo triple inversion recovery sequences were applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables between patients and controls were compared using t tests for quantitative and χ2 tests for categorical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ejection fraction (EF) was 40.3 ± 7.8% in patients and 62.6 ± 5.0% in controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In T2-weighted images, patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> had a significantly higher normalized global signal intensity ratio compared to controls (2.2 ± 0.6 and 1.8 ± 0.3, respectively, P = 0.0006), consistent with global myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant but moderate negative correlation between signal intensity ratio in T2-weighted images and EF (-0.39, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence shows that myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is associated with idiopathic nonischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess the clinical and prognostic impact of these findings </plain></SENT>
