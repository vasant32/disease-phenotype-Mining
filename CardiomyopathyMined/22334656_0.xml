<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nearly 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the known cTnT mutations that cause familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> fall within the TNT1 region that is critical to cTn-Tm binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high resolution structure of this domain has not been determined, and this lack of information has hindered structure-function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, a coupled computational experimental approach was employed to correlate changes in cTnT dynamics to basic function using the regulated in vitro motility assay (R-IVM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An in silico approach to calculate forces in terms of a bending coordinate was used to precisely identify decreases in bending forces at residues 105 and 106 within the proposed cTnT "hinge" region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant functional changes were observed in multiple functional properties, including a decrease in the cooperativity of calcium activation, the calcium sensitivity of sliding speed, and maximum sliding speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the computational and experimental findings revealed an association between TNT1 flexibility and the cooperativity of thin filament calcium activation where an increase in flexibility led to a decrease in cooperativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the primary sequence of the TNT1 region revealed a unique pattern of conserved charged TNT1 residues altered by the R92W and R92L mutations and may represent the underlying "structure" modulating this central functional domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide a framework for further integrated in silico/in vitro approaches that may be extended into a high-throughput predictive screen to overcome the current structural limitations in linking molecular phenotype to genotype in thin filament <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
