<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Field studies and chemical analyses identified the predominant toxic plant as western aster (Symphyotrichum ascendens, previously Aster ascendens), which contained over 4,000 ppm Se (dry weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several dead animals that were necropsied had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and myocyte swelling, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypereosinophilia</z:e>, clumping, and coagulation of myocardial proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole blood from 36 surviving steers was collected and analyzed, and 10 steers with elevated Se concentrations were selected for close monitoring and clinical evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each steer was weighed, and serum, blood, liver, skeletal muscle, and hair were regularly collected after removal from the Se-contaminated range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One animal that died 18 days after exposure was necropsied and exhibited severe multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> with extensive hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, degeneration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 180 days postexposure, 2 of the 10 steers were euthanized, and tissue samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both steers had rare, small fibrotic foci in their hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Se elimination half-lives from serum, whole blood, liver, and muscle of the recovering steers were 40.5 ± 8.2, 115.6 ± 25.1, 38.2 ± 5.0, and 98.5 ± 19.1 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Se concentration in hair reached a peak of 11.5 ± 5.3 ppm at 22 days postexposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that cattle are sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Se <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302332" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxicosis</z:e> caused by ingestion of Se-accumulator plants, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some poisoned animals may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> weeks after the toxic exposure, and in the current study, Se was slowly excreted requiring a relatively long withdrawal time </plain></SENT>
