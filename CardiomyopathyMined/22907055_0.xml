<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole heart energetics and contractile reserve are compromised in transgenic mice bearing missense mutations at R92 within the tropomyosin-binding domain of cTnT, despite being distal to the ATP hydrolysis domain of myosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations are associated with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (FHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we test the hypothesis that genetically replacing murine αα-MyHC with murine ββ-MyHC in hearts bearing the R92Q cTnT mutation, a particularly lethal FHC-associated mutation, leads to sufficiently large perturbations in sarcomere function to rescue whole heart energetics and decrease the cost of contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By comparing R92Q cTnT and R92L cTnT mutant hearts, we also test whether any rescue is mutation-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined the energetic state of the isolated perfused heart using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> NMR spectroscopy while simultaneously measuring contractile performance at four work states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the cost of increasing contraction in intact mouse hearts with R92Q cTnT depends on the type of myosin present in the thick filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that the salutary effect of this maneuver is mutation-specific, demonstrating the major regulatory role of cTnT on sarcomere function at the whole heart level </plain></SENT>
