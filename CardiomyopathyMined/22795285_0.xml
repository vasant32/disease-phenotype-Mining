<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: About 4% of African Americans possess the isoleucine 122 (V122I) variant of transthyretin, associated with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> beyond ages of 55 to 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthyretin <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> associated with variant V122I (ATTR V122I) is likely to be an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in Afro-Caribbean populations, but the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) and lack of awareness of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> pose diagnostic hurdles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the electrocardiographic (ECG) features of ATTR V122I in the largest clinical series to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with ATTR V122I were identified in collaboration with the UK National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ECG at presentation was assessed for cardiac rhythm, axis, and voltage complex size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We include 64 patients with ATTR V122I, with a median age of 74 years (range, 57-88 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> or increased ECG voltage was present in 44.3% of patients, and overall 25% met the criteria for LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation between voltage complex size and duration of illness was seen (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> was evident in 56% of patients in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (n = 17; median, 28 months), 50% of patients with initial first-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> required pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic voltages meet the criteria for LVH in one quarter of patients with ATTR V122I cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The widely held belief that cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is associated with low-voltage complexes is likely to contribute to underdiagnosis of ATTR V122I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> is common at diagnosis and identifies patients at high risk for subsequent pacing requirement </plain></SENT>
