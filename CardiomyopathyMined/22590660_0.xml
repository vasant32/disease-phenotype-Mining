<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) levels have been shown to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> severity in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, NO produced via inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS/NOS2) is proposed to play a role in Trypanosoma cruzi control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the participation of iNOS/NOS2 and NO in T. cruzi control and heart injury has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, using chronically infected rhesus monkeys and iNOS/NOS2-deficient (Nos2(-/-)) mice we explored the participation of iNOS/NOS2-derived NO in heart injury in T. cruzi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Rhesus monkeys and C57BL/6 and Nos2(-/-) mice were infected with the Colombian T. cruzi strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parasite DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, T. cruzi antigens and iNOS/NOS2(+) cells were immunohistochemically detected in heart sections and NO levels in serum were determined by Griess reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart injury was assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase heart isoenzyme (CK-MB) activity levels in serum and connexin 43 (Cx43) expression in the cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chronically infected monkeys presented conduction abnormalities, <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>cardiac inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, which resembled the spectrum of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> was associated with parasite persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Cx43 loss and increased CK-MB activity levels were primarily correlated with iNOS/NOS2(+) cells infiltrating the cardiac tissue and NO levels in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies in Nos2(-/-) mice reinforced that the iNOS/NOS2-NO pathway plays a pivotal role in T. cruzi-elicited cardiomyocyte injury and in conduction abnormalities that were associated with Cx43 loss in the cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T. cruzi-infected rhesus monkeys reproduce features of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data support that in T. cruzi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> persistent parasite-triggered iNOS/NOS2 in the cardiac tissue and NO overproduction might contribute to <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> severity, mainly disturbing of the molecular pathway involved in electrical synchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings open a new avenue for therapeutic tools in Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
