<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: More than four decades have passed since the first clinical use of an (IABP) to improve the clinical scenario for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The original IAB catheter size was 15 French (Fr), requiring an open surgical insertion and removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This therapy has now become the most widely used mechanical device for failure of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The introduction of an 8 Fr fibre-optic IAB catheter with a 50 cc diastolic blood volume displacement has further increased the potential clinical impact of this technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This new catheter can be used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over 162 cm in height, allowing a broader spectrum of patients to benefit from increased diastolic blood volume displacement and fibre-optic pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The catheter has been designed on an 8 Fr shaft platform, potentially reducing the incidence of vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present our case report on the world's first implant of this 50cc 8 Fr IAB catheter.Case Report:Cardiac investigations on a 53-year-old man showed the patient to have ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An 8 Fr 50cc Sensation PlusTM IAB catheter was inserted pre-operatively, prior to coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The world's first insertion of this 8 Fr 50 cc IAB catheter was a complete success, with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient's pre-, peri- and post-operative courses were as we expected and event free, underpinned by IABP support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This new 50 cc, 8 Fr IAB expands the patient group that can benefit from greater diastolic blood volume delivery, improved distal perfusion, more accurate monitoring, subsequent better beat-per-beat support and, finally, the reduced complication rates associated with an 8 Fr shaft </plain></SENT>
