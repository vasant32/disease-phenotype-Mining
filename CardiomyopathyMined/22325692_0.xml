<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Infant heart transplant (HT) recipients have the best long-term survival of any age group, but the small donor pool and high early mortality limit the therapeutic effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the relationship between pre-HT diagnosis and early HT outcome to better define the mortality risk associated with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) and to examine differences between early and current HT eras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (PHTS) database was used to identify 739 infant HT recipients at age â‰¤ 6 months between 1993 and 2008 divided into the following etiologic groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CM), 18%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004383'>hypoplastic left heart</z:hpo> syndrome (HLHS) without surgery, 41%; HLHS with surgery, 9%; other CHD without surgery, 16%; and other CHD with surgery, 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of illness at HT, post-HT survival, and era effects were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1 year after HT, survival was 89% for the CM group, which was the best, 79% for CHD without surgery, 82% for CHD with surgery, 79% for HLHS without surgery, and 70% for HLHS with surgery, which was the worst outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard function analysis demonstrated the difference occurred within the first 3 months after HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for illness severity, differences in mortality risk persisted across etiologic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HT survival was similar in the current surgical era for HLHS with surgery, 71% (1993-1998) vs 70% (1999-2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infant HT recipients with different pre-HT diagnoses have significantly different post-HT outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLHS infants with surgery have the lowest survival and their outcome is unchanged in the current era </plain></SENT>
