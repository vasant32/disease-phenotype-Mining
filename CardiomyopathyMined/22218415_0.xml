<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent to which cardiac autonomic and mechanical ventricular functions are altered and whether they are associated in asymptomatic chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 13 patients with asymptomatic chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (control group) were evaluated and the autonomic modulation of heart rate variability for five minutes, in the temporal and spectral domains, in the supine and orthostatic positions, as well as ventricular function based on morphological-functional variables obtained by Doppler echocardiography were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both positions, the temporal index (p = 0.0004 to 0.01) and total (p = 0.0007-0.005) and absolute spectral areas, of low and high frequencies (p = 0.0001 to 0.002), were lower in the chagasic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vagal-sympathetic balance was similar in both positions (p = 0.43 to 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic variables did not differ between groups (p = 0.13 to 0.82), except the left ventricular end-systolic diameter, which was larger (p = 0.04) and correlated directly with reduced rates of global (p = 0.01 to 0.04) and parasympathetic (p = 0.002 to 0.01) autonomic modulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> in the orthostatic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> with preserved balance were associated with only one ventricular dysfunction indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> may precede and be independently more severe than ventricular dysfunction, with no causal association between both disorders in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
