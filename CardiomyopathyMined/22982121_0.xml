<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the individual importance of each enzyme in the reduction and to provide deeper insight into the binding at atomic level we performed molecular docking and dynamics simulations of DAUN and DOX into the active sites of human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> reductase 1 (CBR1) and human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> reductase (AKR1A1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such simulations evidenced a different behavior between the reductases with respect to DAUN and DOX suggesting major contribution of CBR1 in the reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results are in agreement with available experimental data and for each enzyme and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> pair provided the identification of key residues involved in the interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structural models that we have derived could serve as a useful tool for structure-guided drug design studies </plain></SENT>
