<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many factors may contribute to the development of idiopathic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> in K. breviceps, including genetics, infectious agents, contaminants, biotoxins, and dietary intake (e.g. <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, mercury, and pro-oxidants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed trace elements in K. breviceps at various stages of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> progression using fresh frozen liver and heart samples collected from individuals that stranded along US Atlantic and Gulf coasts between 1993 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard addition calibration and collision cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were employed for total Se analysis and pyrolysis atomic absorption (AA) was utilized for total Hg analysis to examine if the Se/Hg detoxification pathway inhibits the bioavailability of Se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double spike speciated isotope dilution gas chromatography ICP-MS was utilized to measure <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> Hg and inorganic Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot detection and colorimetric assays were used to assess protein oxidation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data collected on trace elements, selenoproteins, and oxidative status were evaluated in the context of animal life history and other complementary histological information to gain insight into the biochemical pathways contributing to the development of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> in K. breviceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was only observed in adult pygmy sperm whales, predominantly in male animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both Hg:Se molar ratios and overall protein oxidation were greater in males than females and increased with progression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
