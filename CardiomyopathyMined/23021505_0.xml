<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The clinical analyses and prognoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> diseases with A3243G mutation are rarely documented in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study investigated the clinical phenotypes and the outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disease and the A3243G mutation of mtDNA in a Taiwanese population, and compared these with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 22 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disease and the A3243G mutation of mtDNA in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1988 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a detailed demographic registration, neurological examinations, a muscle biopsy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin scale, the presence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, critical medical complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were monitored during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> were found in 12 (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visceral involvement, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, were noted in five patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (92%) and a younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> (21.3±7.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox-regression model showed a marked deterioration in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after 7 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> are the most important predictive values for a poor outcome in patients with the mtA3243G mutation of mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo> and visceral organ involvement had no prominent influence on the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some medical complications could be well controlled or even reversed after management </plain></SENT>
