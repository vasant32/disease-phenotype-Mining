<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There are limited data on whether differences exist in left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony indices derived from stress versus rest gated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stress/rest (82)Rb gated PET was performed in consecutive patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MPI between 2006 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 [LV ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 55% and QRS &lt; 120 ms] and group 2 (LVEF ≤35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were acquired on a dedicated PET scanner prior to and on a hybrid PET/CT system after November 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV dyssynchrony indices [phase standard deviation (SD)° and SD (ms)] were derived from stress and rest gated images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 91 patients in group 1 (age 61 ± 13, LVEF 66 ± 8%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QRS) and 126 in group 2 (age 66 ± 12, LVEF 25 ± 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stress derived LVEF were significantly higher than rest for either group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> had significantly higher dyssynchrony indices compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEF (rest SD° 49.2 ± 21.5° vs 16.8 ± 7.8° and stress SD° 42.5 ± 19.4° vs 12.4 ± 3.7°, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dyssynchrony indices derived from rest gated images were significantly higher than those derived from stress in both groups (p &lt; 0.001 by unpaired and paired t test) and irrespective of the type of PET scanner utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, 20/87 (23%) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEF and 27/66 (41%) of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> but without dyssynchrony based on stress indices were recategorized as having significant dyssynchrony given their resting indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LV mechanical dyssynchrony indices by phase analysis are smaller when derived from peak stress versus rest gated PET imaging in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MPI, irrespective of the resting LVEF </plain></SENT>
