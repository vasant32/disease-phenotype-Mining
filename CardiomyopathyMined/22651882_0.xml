<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Definition of the diurnal hourly pattern of TTC events may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of this complex entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively enrolled 186 consecutive patients with TTC (68 ± 14 years old, 95% women) and, for comparison, 2,975 patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) at the Minneapolis Heart Institute over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circadian periodicity was analyzed for hourly occurrence of events throughout the day and for days of the week and months of the year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of TTC showed a nonuniform distribution with a distinctive afternoon peak from 12:00 (noon) to 4:00 p.m., comprising 28% (n = 52) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events, and with the nadir at 12 to 4 a.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(chi-square 25.6, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with events within the peak were older (73 ± 13 years) than other patients (66 ± 13 years, p = 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Events were uniformly distributed over days of the week and months (p = 0.2 and 0.47, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> showed peak occurrence in the early morning hours, 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., comprising 24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events (chi-square 248, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TTC events occurred in a circadian pattern with a peak in the afternoon hours, distinctive from the predilection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> for morning hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This timing of TTC events is most consistent with mechanisms underlying stressful life situations that usually trigger this condition </plain></SENT>
