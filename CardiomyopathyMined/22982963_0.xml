<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We read with great interest the article by Kalra et al.(1) titled "Antitachycardia pacing reduces appropriate and inappropriate shocks in children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> patients" recently published in HeartRhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, authors retrospectively reviewed the efficacy of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in children and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> (CHD), primary electrical diseases and selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although authors did not report the generalized estimated equation-adjusted efficacy of ATP (as usually performed in such studies), the unadjusted efficacy was as high as 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regarding the programming, 8-pulses burst at 88% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle length with multiple sequences were programmed (from 2 to 6 sequences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, authors report that the majority of episodes were terminated with one or 2 attempts, but that 3 episodes were terminated by the 4(th), the 5(th) and the 8(th) sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite delaying the successful therapy, those episodes were not symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study findings raise some key points regarding adequate number of ATP sequences to program in this selected population, which led us to write this letter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recently published a study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of programming more than the usual 1 or 2 ATP attempts (10 sequences programmed in our study) for patients implanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery diseases</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of episodes were terminated by the first or the second attempt, a high proportion of patients had at least one episode treated by three or more ATP attempts, and would have experienced painful shocks if less sequences would have been programmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The benefit of such strategy was clear up to the 5(th) attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although our study focused in adult patients with ischemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, we would like to emphasize the fact that in a selected pediatric population with CHD, overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, and for those with a secondary prevention indication, one should not be frightened of programming more than the usual 1 or 2 ATP attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with primary electrical diseases had 0% ATP efficacy in the Kalra et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>study(1), and should not be considered as good candidates for aggressive ATP programming </plain></SENT>
