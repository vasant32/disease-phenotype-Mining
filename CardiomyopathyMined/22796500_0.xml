<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we developed a simple cell-based, nonradioactive method for functional screening of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stable cell lines expressing human SGLT1 and SGLT2 were established by transfecting HEK293 cells with vectors (pCMV6-Neo) having full-length human SGLT1 and SGLT2 and selecting the positive clones following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the gene expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to analyze the function of SGLTs, we incubated stable cell lines with 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> or fluorescent d-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> analog (2-NBDG) and performed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant (P&lt;0.001) increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was observed in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in both cell lines was completely inhibited when treated with nonspecific SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> (100μM), but not when treated with nonspecific <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-independent facilitative <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (GLUT) inhibitors (100μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that cell-based methods developed for screening SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8113">phlorizin</z:chebi> sensitive and specific for respective <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This assay provides a simple and rapid method for identifying novel and selective SGLT inhibitors </plain></SENT>
