<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if premature complexes independent of "dyssynchrony" resulted in increased left ventricular (LV) dimensions and decreased LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Ten mongrel dogs underwent the implantation of a pacemaker and were randomized to a control group (n = 5) or a paced group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the paced group, the pacemaker was connected to two endocardial atrial leads, one inserted into the atrial port and the other one into the ventricular port with an atrioventricular delay adjusted to ensure the presence of coupled pacing simulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262382" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial bigeminy</z:e> with conducted beats in the absence of aberrancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters of LV size (LV end-diastolic diameter [LV-EDD], LV end-systolic diameter [LV-ESD]), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of monitoring (control group) or pacing (paced group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results:  In the control group, LV size decreased with no significant changes in LVEF: 55% at baseline versus 70% at 4 weeks (P = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the paced group, LV-EDD decreased with no significant change in LV-ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike the control group, LVEF decreased significantly from 69 ± 9% at baseline to 32 ± 22% after 4 weeks of pacing (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  We have shown that 4 weeks of coupled pacing simulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262382" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial bigeminy</z:e> significantly reduced LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that premature complexes independent of ventricular dyssynchrony might lead to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
