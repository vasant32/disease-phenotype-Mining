<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the level of the individual cell, direct cell-cell adherence and communication is mediated by the intercellular junction complexes: desmosomes, adherens, tight and gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A broad spectrum of inherited, infectious and auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> can affect the proper function of intercellular junctions and result in either diseases affecting specific individual tissues or widespread syndromic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A particularly diverse group of diseases result from direct or indirect disruption of desmosomes--a consequence of their importance in tissue integrity, their extensive distribution, complex structure, and the wide variety of functions their components accomplish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, disruption of desmosomal assembly, structure or integrity disrupts not only their intercellular adhesive function but also their functions in cell communication and regulation, leading to such diverse pathologies as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, epidermal and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blistering</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000982'>palmoplantar keratoderma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002224'>woolly hair</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratosis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">epidermolysis bullosa</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, as well as describing the importance of the other intercellular junctions, we focus primarily on the desmosome, its structure and its role in disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We will examine the various pathologies that result from impairment of desmosome function and thereby demonstrate the importance of desmosomes to tissues and to the organism as a whole </plain></SENT>
