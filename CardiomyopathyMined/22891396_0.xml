<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found to be associated with cardiac electrical instability in patients with ischemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the reproducibility of the MTWA test results in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> who participated in a rehabilitation program at the Assaf Harofeh Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MTWA was measured during a bicycle exercise test at the first encounter and repeated after one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 40 study patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 4 had an indeterminate result and were excluded from the data analysis; 5 had a positive MTWA in the first and second study (14%), 27 had a negative MTWA in the first and second study (75%), and 4 had a negative MTWA in the first study and a positive MTWA in the second study (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a correlation between the results of the first and the second study in 89% of the patients (kappa = 0.652, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MTWA measurements are reproducible in the short term in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
