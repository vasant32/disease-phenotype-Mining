<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, two-dimensional echocardiography has been the most reliable method for establishing a clinical diagnosis of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), with its high spatial resolution and tomographic imaging capability, has emerged as a technique particularly well suited to characterize the diverse phenotypic expression of this complex disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, CMR is often superior to echocardiography for HCM diagnosis, by identifying areas of segmental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (ie., anterolateral wall or apex) not reliably visualized by echocardiography (or underestimated in terms of extent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-risk HCM patient subgroups identified with CMR include those with thin-walled scarred LV apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (which prior to CMR imaging in HCM remained largely undetected), end-stage systolic dysfunction, and massive LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMR observations also suggest that the cardiomyopathic process in HCM is more diffuse than previously regarded, extending beyond the LV myocardium to include thickening of the right ventricular wall as well as substantial morphologic diversity with regard to papillary muscles and mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for management strategies in patients undergoing invasive septal reduction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among HCM family members, CMR has identified unique phenotypic markers of affected genetic status in the absence of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> including: myocardial crypts, elongated mitral valve leaflets and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unique capability of contrast-enhanced CMR with late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> has raised the expectation that this may represent a novel marker, which may enhance risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At this time, late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement appears to be an important determinant of adverse LV remodeling associated with systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive significance of LGE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> is incompletely resolved and ultimately future large prospective studies may provide greater insights into this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations underscore an important role for CMR in the contemporary assessment of patients with HCM, providing important information impacting diagnosis and clinical management strategies </plain></SENT>
