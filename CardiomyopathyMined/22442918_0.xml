<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) may be challenging for the risk of surgical complications or insufficient resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our cutting tool to perform proper muscular resection in HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients (5 males, mean age 43,1 +/- 19,6 years, range 9-70 years) were operated on for HC using this semicircular cutting device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined procedures were : mitral valve repair (n = 1), mitral valve replacement (n = 2), right ventricular myectomy (n = 1), aortic valve replacement (n = 1), mitral and aortic replacement (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the surviving patients are alive over a variable follow up from 2 to 8 years, with consistent reduction of symptoms: in fact, no patient had residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> with significant reduction of the NYHA class from 3,2 +/- 0,6 to 1,3 +/- 0,5 postoperatively (p &lt; 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscular resection was effective with significant reduction of sub-valvular gradient from 84.5 + 33,4 mmHg to 14,1 +/- 17,6 mmHg (p &lt; 0,05) without complications such as complete atrio-ventricular block or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our semicircular myotome is an effective tool to perform a safe myectomy and it avoids surgical complications such as atrio-ventricular blocks or sub-valvular injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that this cutting tool offers a reproducible method for muscular resection and it shows appreciable effects in the reduction of sub-valvular gradient with promising results in terms of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
