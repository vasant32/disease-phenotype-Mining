<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: A 37-year-old man with end-stage idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> underwent an orthotopic heart transplant followed by a reoperation with mitral annuloplasty for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, he developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> and severe recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> due to annuloplasty ring dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dehisced annuloplasty ring was refixated, followed by tricuspid annuloplasty through a right anterolateral thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After four years of follow-up, there are no signs of recurrent mitral or tricupid regurgitation and the patient remains in NYHA class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pushing the envelope on conventional surgical procedures in marginal donor hearts (both before and after transplantation) may not only improve the patient's functional status and reduce the need for retransplantation, but it may ultimately alleviate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> shortage of donor hearts </plain></SENT>
