<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the prevalence of different types of dyssynchrony in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and to establish the correlation between atrio-ventricular block and atrio-ventricular dyssynchrony (AVD), and between impaired intra-ventricular conduction and the existence of inter-ventricular dyssynchrony (inter-VD) and intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony (intra-LVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 40 patients in New York Heart Association stage III or IV, admitted consecutively with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular enddiastolic diameter ≥ 60 mm and/or ≥ 30 mm/m(2)) and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: group 1: eight patients, with a QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>; group 2: 32 patients with a narrow QRS &lt; 120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the mean age was 54.7 ± 16.8 years and patients in group 1 were older (67.2 ± 13.6 vs 51.5 ± 15.8 years, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of atrio-ventricular dyssynchrony (AVD), inter-VD and intra-LVD was respectively 40, 47.5 and 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (5%) did not exhibit dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AVD was present with a similar frequency in the two groups (37.5% in group 1 vs 40.6% in group 2, p = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of the magnitude of AVD with the duration of the PR interval (from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) (r(2) = 0.02, p = 0.37) or the QRS width (r(2) = 0.01, p = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of patients with inter-VD was observed in group 1 (87.5 vs 60%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a more important inter-ventricular mechanical delay according to QRS width (r(2) = 0.009, p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proportion of intra-LVD was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, with a high prevalence (87.5% in group 1 and 65.6% in group 2, p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The assessment of cardiac dyssynchrony is possible in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intra-ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony had a high prevalence in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, irrespective of the QRS width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data emphasise the usefulness of echocardiography in the screening of patients </plain></SENT>
