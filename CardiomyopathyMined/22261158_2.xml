<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Revascularization with coronary bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention plays a pivotal role in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, although these interventions are often associated with relatively high peri-procedural risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological substrate of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, varying from predominantly hibernating myocardium to irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is evidence to suggest that patients with hibernating myocardium benefit most from revascularization, whereas medical therapy is associated with an adverse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, noninvasive testing is recommended by relevant guidelines to guide optimal management in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the role of noninvasive testing has recently been challenged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are various imaging modalities available that provide information on different aspects of the disease, and therefore, they differ significantly in sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, choosing among the different imaging modalities can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance has evolved into a comprehensive modality that can accurately determine the amount of hibernating myocardium as well as the presence and degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and the extent of the scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the indications, accuracy, and clinical utility of the available imaging techniques, with a special focus on cardiac magnetic resonance in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and provides an outlook on how this field might evolve in the future </plain></SENT>
