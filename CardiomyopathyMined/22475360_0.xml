<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most families, the disease-causing mutation is unknown, and relatives should therefore undergo periodic screening to facilitate early diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we describe a novel titin truncation mutation causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in an Israeli Arab family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The family members underwent physical examination, electrocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage to candidate loci was performed, followed by gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 13 clinically affected family members (8 men and 5 women, mean age 47 ± 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with their healthy first-degree relatives, the affected relatives had a larger end-diastolic left ventricular dimension (60 ± 10 vs 49 ± 4 mm, p &lt;0.001), lower ejection fraction (43 ± 11% vs 60 ± 6%, p &lt;0.001), and markedly higher end-systolic volume indexes but no difference in wall thickness or diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The linkage studies or direct sequencing excluded LMNA, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, SCN5A, DES, SGCD, ACTC, PLN, and MYH6 but established linkage to the TTN locus at chromosome 2q31, yielding a maximum (2-point) LOD score of 3.44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis identified an insertion (c.58880insA), causing protein truncation after 19,628 amino acids (p.S19628IfsX1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect was found among the Israeli Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, titin is a giant protein with a key role in sarcomere assembly, force transmission, and maintenance of resting tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although some mutations result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003756'>skeletal myopathy</z:hpo>, others cause isolated, maturity-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
