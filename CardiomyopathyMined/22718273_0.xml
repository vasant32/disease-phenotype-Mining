<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment modality that improves functional outcome and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optimal outcome requires transplantation early in life and with myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can be present at diagnosis and may seemingly preclude this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of those cases transplanted in Manchester since 2000 that initially presented with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with a view to identifying general management principles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 44 MPSIH children transplanted in this period, 6 had displayed moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at presentation; symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> was the predominant presenting feature in five of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic and clinical improvement in cardiac function was observed with extended enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with recovery of fractional shortening to ≥25 % achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before coming to transplant (after median 19 weeks ERT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were transplanted successfully, with good functional and cardiologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> conditioning was implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CHF|chf">cardiac decompensation</z:e> in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experiences highlight three important messages: (1) A diagnosis of MPSIH should be considered in any infant presenting with unexplained severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>; (2) ERT pre-transplant can improve cardiac function sufficiently to permit safe HSCT using myeloablative conditioning; and (3) High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> should be avoided in conditioning these patients </plain></SENT>
