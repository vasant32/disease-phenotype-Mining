<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide imaging is promising for such patients because it can simultaneously determine left ventricular function, evaluate for the presence of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, determine the extent of viable myocardium, and evaluate dyssynchronous left ventricular contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide imaging can thus provide important noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology, prognosis, and management of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction as well as more advanced heat failure </plain></SENT>
