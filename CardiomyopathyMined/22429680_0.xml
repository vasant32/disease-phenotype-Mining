<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The elevated number of genes and mutations involved in HCM limits a gene-based diagnosis that should be considered of most importance for basic research and clinical medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: In this report, we evaluated High Resolution Melting (HRM) robustness, regarding HCM genetic testing, by means of analyzing 28 HCM-associated genes, including the most frequent 4 HCM-associated sarcomere genes, as well as 24 genes with lower reported HCM-phenotype association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 80 Portuguese individuals with clinical phenotype of HCM allowing simultaneously a better characterization of this disease in the Portuguese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HRM technology allowed us to identify 60 mutated alleles in 72 HCM patients: 49 missense mutations, 3 nonsense mutations, one 1-bp deletion, one 5-bp deletion, one in frame 3-bp deletion, one insertion/deletion, 3 splice mutations, one 5'UTR mutation in MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, CSRP3, MYH6 and MYL2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly 22 are novel gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRM was proven to be a technique with high sensitivity and a low false positive ratio allowing a rapid, innovative and low cost genotyping of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a short return, HRM as a gene scanning technique could be a cost-effective gene-based diagnosis for an accurate HCM genetic diagnosis and hopefully providing new insights into genotype/phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
