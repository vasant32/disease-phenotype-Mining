<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The factors responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our studies of the transcriptome of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes identified novel genes up-regulated during cardiac differentiation, including RBM24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied how its deficiency affected heart development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of Rbm24 was detected in mouse cardiomyocytes and embryonic myocardium of zebrafish at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Rbm24 loss-of-function showed that Rbm24 deficiency resulted in a reduction in sarcomeric proteins, Z-disc abnormality, and diminished heart contractility, resulting in the absence of circulation in zebrafish embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling revealed down-regulation of multiple pathways associated with sarcomere assembly and vasculature development in Rbm24 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified a novel role of the tissue-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein (RBP) Rbm24 involving in the regulation of cardiac gene expression, sarcomeric assembly, and cardiac contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study uncovers a potential novel pathway to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> through down-regulation of the RBP Rbm24 </plain></SENT>
