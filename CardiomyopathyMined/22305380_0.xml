<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether post-transplant outcomes differ among patients with PPCM compared with other recipients remains unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for cardiac transplants, comparing characteristics and outcomes for PPCM, other women, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1987 and 2010, 42,406 patients (9,419 women and 32,987 men) received a heart transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 485 women who had PPCM as the indication were younger (p &lt; 0.001), had higher sensitization (p &lt; 0.001), required higher intensity of cardiovascular support pre-transplant (p = 0.026), and had higher <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> status (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with PPCM had more post-transplant rejection during the index transplant hospitalization (p &lt; 0.001) and during the first year (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing PPCM with other women and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others, graft survival was inferior (p = 0.004 and p &lt; 0.003, respectively) and age-adjusted survival was lower (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large report shows outcomes of graft failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are inferior for recipients with PPCM, which may be partly explained by younger age, higher allosensitization, higher pre-transplant acuity, and increased rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to determine management strategies to improve outcomes in PPCM heart transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
