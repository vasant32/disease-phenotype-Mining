<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely established, free of radioactive material or ionizing radiation, and the accepted noninvasive gold standard for numerous noninvasive cardiac markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a technique called T2-weighted imaging, CMR can be used to assess myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> as a reliable marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, potentially reversible myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast agents are not required as the myocardial free water content affects the magnetic properties of the tissue, thus providing inherent image contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we illustrate the utility of T2-weighted techniques in the assessment of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a range of clinical scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is clinically relevant in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> settings and may be further helpful to better understand the pathophysiology of many non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, T2-weighted CMR represents the only imaging modality that can accurately depict and quantify the presence of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a noninvasive fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, T2-weighted imaging should be included in a comprehensive CMR imaging protocol, especially if an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury is suspected </plain></SENT>
