<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a contemporary overview of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), incorporating recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> on disease mechanisms and advances in therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical, pathological, genetic, and mechanistic definitions of HCM are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic profile of HCM in both adults and children is explored to the extent of present knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of morphological and histological abnormalities in HCM is reviewed, including involvement of the right ventricle, which is less widely recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality from HCM may result from diastolic dysfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or-less commonly-progression to "burnt out" disease or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defibrillators offer an efficacious means of averting SCD, but are not without their complications, underscoring the importance of identifying at-risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We address the strengths and weaknesses of prognostication based on readily obtainable clinical markers, and discuss the integration of auxiliary approaches such as genotyping, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and fractionation analysis into existing risk stratification guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide an update on the pharmacological and interventional management of HCM, including the advent of disease-modifying therapy </plain></SENT>
