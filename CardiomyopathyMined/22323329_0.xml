<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the pathological changes of the cardiac conduction system related to AVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sinus node, the compact node, and the penetrating bundle (bundle of His) had no abnormalities, however, there was extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the terminal portions of the branching bundle and the beginning of the left and right bundles at the top of the ventricular septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this fibrous replacement is probably the same that leads to extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the working ventricular myocardium, and remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
