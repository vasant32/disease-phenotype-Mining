<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), plasma B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) seems devoid of biological effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BNP(1-32) could be truncated into BNP(3-32) by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), and BNP(3-32) has reduced biological activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Increased DPP4 activity is associated with pathophysiology of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: One hundred twenty-eight client-owned dogs and 9 experimental Beagles from the Clinical Veterinary Unit of the University of Liège </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively measured plasma DPP4 activity in 5 groups of dogs: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growing dogs (n = 21), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult dogs (n = 60), healthy Beagle (n = 9), dogs with myxomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> (n = 35), and dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis and the severity of HF were determined by Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma DPP4 activity was measured kinetically by a fluorimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In growing dogs, DPP4 activity was higher than in adults (P &lt; .001) and inversely correlated with age (r = -0.57, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adults, DPP4 activity increased linearly with body weight (r = 0.39, P &lt; .01), but there was no influence of age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No effect of the circadian rhythm was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPP4 activity was significantly higher in HF ISACHC I (16.3 ± 1.14 U/L) compared with healthy adults (12.4 ± 0.65 U/L, P &lt; .05) and HF ISACHC III (11.0 ± 1.50 U/L, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean DPP4 activity in ISACHC II was 15.1 ± 1.4 U/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We did not find evidence that plasma DPP4 activity is responsible for the "BNP resistance" in overt congestive HF, but it may be implicated in early stages </plain></SENT>
