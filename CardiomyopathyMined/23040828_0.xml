<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the early and late results of septal myectomy in pediatric HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 127 consecutive patients (62% male) who underwent transaortic septal myectomy for obstructive HCM from January 1975 to December 2010 at 21 or less years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age at operation was 12.9 Â± 5.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, mean maximum instantaneous gradient was 89 mm Hg and 95% had significant systolic anterior motion (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) and permanent pacemaker prior to surgery was present in 21 patients (17%) and 15 (11.7%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transaortic extended left ventricular septal myectomy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iatrogenic morbidity included new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> requiring repair in 7 (5.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> needing repair in 2 (1.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> in 1 (1%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> requiring permanent pacemaker in 1 (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was implanted postoperatively in 8 during the same hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean MIG decreased from 89 to 6 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, residual chordal <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> was present in 23% with mild or no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>; moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was detected in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients (3%) died late during the mean follow-up period of 8.3 years (maximum, 37 years); 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was sudden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 98.6%, 94.9%, 92.4%, and 92.4% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Freedom from any cardiac reoperation was 91.2%, 87.8%, 78.7%, and 72.7% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Repeat septal myectomy was performed in 6 patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At late follow-up, 95% were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II and 25 patients underwent late <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Septal myectomy is safe and effective in children with obstructive HCM, but limited exposure may increase risk of aortic or mitral valve injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Late survival is better than the previously published untreated natural history of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patient selection and surgical expertise remain critical components of septal myectomy, especially before considering a prophylactic myectomy in a seemingly asymptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
