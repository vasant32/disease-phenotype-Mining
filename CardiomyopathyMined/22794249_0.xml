<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that these mutations increase both Ca(2+) sensitivity and residual contractile activity at low Ca(2+) concentrations, which causes incomplete relaxation during diastole resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and sarcomeric disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular basis for the cause and the difference in the severity of the manifested phenotypes of disease are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work we have (1) used ATPase studies using reconstituted thin filaments in solution to show that these FHC mutants result in an increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity and an increased residual level of ATPase, (2) shown that both FHC mutants increase the rate of cleavage at R133, ∼45 residues N-terminal to the mutations, when free and bound to actin, (3) shown that for Tm-E180G, the increase in the rate of cleavage is greater than that for D175N, and (4) shown that for E180G, cleavage also occurs at a new site 53 residues C-terminal to E180G, in parallel with cleavage at R133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long-range decreases in dynamic stability due to these two single-site mutations suggest increases in flexibility that may weaken the ability of Tm to inhibit activity at low Ca(2+) concentrations for D175N and to a greater degree for E180G, which may contribute to differences in the severity of FHC </plain></SENT>
