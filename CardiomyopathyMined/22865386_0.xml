<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway normalized contractile function of diabetic rat hearts, but the underlying mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PKCβ(2) has been proposed to play a major role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at least in part by increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further evidence suggests that PKC positively regulates RhoA expression through induction of iNOS in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in preliminary studies we found that inhibition of ROCK itself reduced RhoA expression in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that there is an interaction between RhoA/ROCK and PKCβ(2) in the form of a positive feedback loop that sustains their activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was investigated in cardiomyocytes isolated from diabetic and control rat hearts, incubated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> D or inhibitors of ROCK, RhoA, PKCβ(2) or iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of RhoA and ROCK markedly attenuated the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced increases in PKCβ(2) activity and iNOS and RhoA expression in diabetic cardiomyocytes, while having no effect in control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PKCβ(2) and iNOS also normalized RhoA expression and ROCK overactivation, while iNOS inhibition reversed the increase in PKCβ(2) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of these treatments also normalized the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced increase in production of ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actin cytoskeleton disruption attenuated the increased expression and/or activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these targets in diabetic cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, in the diabetic heart, the RhoA/ROCK pathway contributes to contractile dysfunction at least in part by sustaining PKCβ(2) activation and ROS production via a positive feedback loop that requires an intact cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
