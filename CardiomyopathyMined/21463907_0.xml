<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is characterized by left ventricular (LV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and regional <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent high-end echocardiography studies of selected LV sections suggest an interrelation between regional <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, impaired function, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> possibly changing under specific enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for a region dependent study of cardiac function, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and late enhancement (LE) in 25 Fabry patients before and after 12months of ERT in comparison to 43 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fabry patients presented with LV increased wall thickness (EDWT) and reduced wall thickening (WT) with a focus on basal and midventricular regions corresponding to areas of LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo> were the highest if LE was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of the EDWT under ERT was observed in LE negative patients accompanied by a decline of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo> with regional differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and wall motion were detected corresponding to the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> (LE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional impairment was closely restricted to fibrotic regions while morphologic changes slightly exceeded the areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERT resulted in regional improvements whereby absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was connected to a better outcome </plain></SENT>
