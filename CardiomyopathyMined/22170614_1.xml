<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) has mainly been categorized as a circulating and a local tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new component of the local system, known as the intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, has recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> is defined as synthesis and action of ANG II intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> appears to differ from the circulating and the local <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, in terms of components and the mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences may alter treatment strategies that target the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in several pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated significant upregulation of the cardiac, intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which is associated with cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we have reviewed evidence supporting an intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in different cell types, ANG II's actions in cardiac cells, and its mechanism of action, focusing on the intracellular cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have discussed the significance of an intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in cardiac pathophysiology and implications for potential therapies </plain></SENT>
