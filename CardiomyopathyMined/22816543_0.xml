<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to predict cardiovascular risk; however, like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk factors with imperfect specificity, studies in low risk populations have been plagued by poor predictive accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although predictive accuracy might be improved among cohorts with a higher likelihood of cardiovascular events, this would also affect the prevalence of abnormal parameters and their exclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: To determine the magnitude of these changes in a cohort with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> we analyzed 15 previously validated high-risk parameters from the resting and ambulatory ECG in subjects enrolled in the Prediction of Arrhythmic Events with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> Emission Tomography (PAREPET) study (n = 198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the published exclusion criteria from the validation studies (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, persistent pacing, prolonged QRS), only 4 high-risk ECG parameters (27%) could be evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and only 42% of subjects could have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 ECG parameters assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, almost every subject (97%) had at least one abnormal parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, there were 3.4 ± 1.8 (range, 0-8) high-risk ECG parameters per subject among the 11.7 ± 4.5 (range, 4-15) parameters that could be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, 34% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessable parameters were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a significant proportion of ECG parameters cannot be assessed in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but high-risk results are ubiquitous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The influence of these issues will be clarified when the results of the PAREPET study are available to actually determine the predictive value of these parameters on cause-specific mortality in a high-risk cohort </plain></SENT>
