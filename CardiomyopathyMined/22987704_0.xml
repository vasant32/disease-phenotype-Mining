<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify these potentially life-threatening and treatable conditions, it is common practice to screen patients intermittently with electrocardiography and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal time interval for such screening investigations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed this study to review our screening results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000590'>progressive external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> (PEO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods: This study was a retrospective review of PEO patients with 5 years or more of cardiac screening investigations who did not have any cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Fifteen patients were included, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was identified on screening echocardiogram in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had other abnormalities identified, which were unrelated to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Only 1 patient in 15 developed cardiac complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disease during 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a screening interval of 3-5 years is probably appropriate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> PEO patients who do not have cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
