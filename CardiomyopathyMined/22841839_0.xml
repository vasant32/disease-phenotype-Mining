<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the prevention of immunorejection following organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological studies suggest a potential new application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but the potential for this application is not yet supported by genetic studies of genes in target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (TOR) signaling in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, supporting genetic evidence was presented in zebrafish using two adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By characterizing a heterozygous zebrafish target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (ztor) mutant, the therapeutic effect of long-term TOR signaling inhibition was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose- and stage-dependent functions of TOR signaling provide an explanation for the seemingly contradictory results obtained in genetic studies of TOR components in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from the zebrafish studies, together with the supporting preliminary clinical studies, suggested that TOR signaling inhibition should be further pursued as a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future directions for developing TOR-based therapy include assessing the long-term benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> as a candidate drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients, defining the dynamic activity of TOR, exploring the impacts of TOR signaling manipulation in different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, and elucidating the downstream signaling branches that confer the therapeutic effects of TOR signaling inhibition </plain></SENT>
