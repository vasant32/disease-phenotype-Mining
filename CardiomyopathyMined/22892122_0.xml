<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In short-term follow-up studies, immunoadsorption (IA) appeared beneficial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) associated with β(1)-adrenoreceptor-autoantibodies (β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the long-term benefits of IA in HTx candidates with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, patients' responsiveness to IA, and the impact of β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> removal on IA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single-centre retrospective study of prospectively gathered information we evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive and -negative HTx candidates with end-stage <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30%] who underwent IA between 1995 and 2005 (follow-up thereafter: 5.3-14.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls we used <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients referred for HTx during the same time period who received no IA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also looked for differences in efficacy between unspecific IA (unselective antibody removal) and specific IA (selective β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> removal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were cardiac function and HTx/ventricular assist device (VAD)-free patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability for 5-year HTx/VAD-free survival for the108 β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients who underwent unspecific IA reached 69.4 ± 4.4% and was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than for both β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients without IA (25.4 ± 11.4%) and β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-negative <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients who also underwent IA (47.4 ± 11.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with high β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> levels, unspecific and specific IA showed the same high efficiency in β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LVEF and New York Heart Assocation class improved (P &lt; 0.01) after both, but without differences in improvement after specific or unspecific IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of responders to specific and unspecific IA was similar (78.3% vs. 79.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 76% of the patients with β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> reappearance, redetection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> coincided with worsening of cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Removal of β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> by specific or unspecific IA can improve cardiac function allowing long-term stability in end-stage <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, which can spare many patients from HTx or will delay HTx <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> for years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In β(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients the benefits of IA appeared to be associated with the removal of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
