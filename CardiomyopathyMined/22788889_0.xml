<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report endovascular treatment of a ruptured mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a patient with previous cardiac surgery, a cardioverter-defibrillator, and an intrathoracic left ventricular assist device (LVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old man was admitted for a syncopal episode and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had a past history of postischemic dilatative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> for which a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An LVAD and bioprosthetic aortic valve were subsequently placed due to severe cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was complicated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6827">methicillin</z:chebi>-resistant Staphylococcus aureus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> requiring temporary dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the current admission 4 months later, urgent computed tomography (CT) showed a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the middle third of the descending thoracic aorta; blood cultures were positive for Candida sp  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was hemodynamically stable, so he was placed in intensive care and given targeted antimicrobial therapy while an endovascular treatment was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At surgery, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28077">rifampicin</z:chebi>-soaked Relay Plus 30-mm√ó95-cm stent-graft was deployed through a right common femoral cutdown to seal the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exclusion was confirmed by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was without recurrent pathology or graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as demonstrated by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair in patients with LVAD is peculiar for several aspects: accurate planning is necessary to adequately visualize the aortic lesion despite the presence of many radiopaque devices and the femoral arteries are pulseless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, extremely slow washout of contrast from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> prevents correct assessment of final sac exclusion with angiography; intraoperative TEE monitoring proved extremely useful </plain></SENT>
