<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of asialoerythropoietin (asialoEPO), a nonerythrogenic erythropoietin derivative, on 3 murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with different etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> within 2 weeks (toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with asialoEPO (6.9 μg/kg) for 2 weeks thereafter attenuated the associated left ventricular dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the asialoEPO-treated heart showed less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and oxidative damage, and diminished atrophic cardiomyocyte degeneration, which was accompanied by restored expression of GATA-4 and sarcomeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice with large 6-week-old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> exhibited marked left ventricular dysfunction with adverse remodeling (ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AsialoEPO treatment for 4 weeks significantly mitigated progression of the dysfunction and remodeling and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, 25-week-old δ-sarcoglycan-deficient mice (genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) were treated with asialoEPO for 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AsialoEPO mitigated the progressive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction through cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and upregulated expression of GATA-4 and sarcomeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AsialoEPO appears to act by altering the activity of the downstream erythropoietin receptor signals extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, Akt, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 and 5 in a model-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that asialoEPO exerts broad cardioprotective effects through distinct mechanisms depending on the model, which are independent of the erythrogenic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compound may be promising for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> of various etiologies </plain></SENT>
