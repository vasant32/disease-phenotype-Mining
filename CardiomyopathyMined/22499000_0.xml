<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> limited to the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a case of AHCM in an African-American patient who presented with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiogram showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unobstructed coronary arteries, whereas left ventricular angiogram revealed an 'ace of spades' sign at the end of diastole that is pathognomonic of AHCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On follow-up echocardiogram 1 year later, the patient was noted to have developed a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysms</z:hpo> are known to occur with AHCM, they are usually found on presentation and, rarely, can develop on follow-up as seen in this patient </plain></SENT>
