<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) &lt; 40% were randomized to intracoronary infusion of MNCs [(5.1 ± 2.0)×10(8), n = 16] or MSCs [(4.9 ± 1.7)×10(8), n = 17] or equal volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (n = 20) through the guiding catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), LVEF and myocardium perfusion defects were assessed before and at (30 ± 3) days and (90 ± 7) days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malignant cardiovascular events were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) One month after the procedure, LVEF in transplantation groups significantly increased compared to before procedure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), and significant increase of LVEF was observed only in MSCs transplantation group compared to control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, absolute changes of LVEDd and perfusion defects of myocardium were similar among and within groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Comparing with before procedure and control group, LVEF in transplantation groups increased significantly in three months after the procedure (P &lt; 0.05), but there were no significant differences between transplantation groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LVEDd and myocardium perfusion defects in transplantation groups improved significantly compared with that of before procedure (P &lt; 0.05), while significant decrease of myocardium perfusion defects was only observed in patients treated with MSCs compared with control group at three months after procedure (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) There were no significant differences in major cardiovascular events between transplantation group and control during follow-up (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary bone marrow stem cells transplantation is safe and effective for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients while the efficacy of MSCs and MNCs transplantation is comparable </plain></SENT>
