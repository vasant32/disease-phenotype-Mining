<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We tested the hypothesis that mutations in the human ventricular essential myosin light chain (hVLC-1) that are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) affect protein structure, binding to the IQ1 motif of cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH) and sarcomeric sorting in neonatal cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We employed circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to investigate structural properties and protein-protein interactions of a recombinant head-rod fragment of rat cardiac β-MYH (amino acids 664-915) with alanine-mutated IQ2 domain (rβ-MYH(664-915)IQ2(ala4)) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or five mutated (M149V, E143K, A57G, E56G, R154H) hVLC-1 forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagging competition was used to monitor the intracellular localization of exogenously introduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and E56G-mutated (hVLC-1(E56G)) hVLC-1 constructs in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy was applied to map the microenvironment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and E56G-mutated hVLC-1 in permeabilized muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affinity of M149V, E143K, A57G, and R154H mutated hVLC-1/rβ-MYH(664-915)IQ2(ala4) complexes was significantly lower compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hVLC-1/rβ-MYH(664-915)IQ2(ala4) complex interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the E56G mutation induced an ∼30-fold lower MYH affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sorting specificity of E56G-mutated hVLC-1 was negligible compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hVLC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence lifetime of fibres replaced with hVLC-1(E56G) increased significantly compared with hVLC-1-replaced fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Disturbed myosin binding of mutated hVLC-1 may provide a pathomechanism for the development of HCM </plain></SENT>
