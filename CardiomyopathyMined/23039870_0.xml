<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Zinc (Zn) is one of the essential trace elements and has numerous physiological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Zn acts as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and also as a part of other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> related proteins, such as metallothionein (MT) and Zn-copper <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Zn deficiency often occurs in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of Zn deficiency or Zn supplementation on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced cardiac and renal pathogeneses has been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) in mice and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zn deficiency was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment of diabetic mice with Zn <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> N,N,N,N-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2 -<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30347">ethylenediamine</z:chebi> (TPEN) for four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For Zn supplementation study, diabetic mice or rats were treated with Zn for three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and histopathological changes in the heart and kidney of these diabetic mice and rats were examined by Western blotting assay, immunohistochemical and fluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> induced cardiac and renal oxidative damage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, which were reversed by Zn supplementation that also induced cardiac and renal MT synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Zn deficiency was found to significantly enhance the renal damage induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several clinical observations also support the preventive effect of Zn in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Zn plays an important role in the protection of the heart and kidney against <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced oxidative damage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that diabetic patients should be monitored and treated for Zn deficiency to avoid the acceleration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced cardiac and renal injury </plain></SENT>
