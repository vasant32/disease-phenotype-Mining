<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the rate of progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> by 2 consecutive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations and its relation with clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, detected by late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE), is associated to a progressive ventricular dysfunction and worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 55 HCM patients (37 males; mean age 43 ± 18 years) underwent 2 CMR examinations (CMR-1 and CMR-2) separated by an interval of 719 ± 410 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extent of LGE was measured, and the rate of progression of LGE (LGE-rate) was calculated as the ratio between the increment of LGE (in grams) and the time (months) between the CMR examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At CMR-1, LGE was detected in 45 subjects, with an extent of 13.3 ± 15.2 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At CMR-2, 53 (96.4%) patients had LGE, with an extent of 24.6 ± 27.5 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 44 patients, LGE extent increased significantly (≥1 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with apical HCM had higher increments of LGE (p = 0.004) and LGE-rate (p &lt; 0.001) than those with other patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of LGE at CMR-1 and the apical pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> were independent predictors of the increment of LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with worsened New York Heart Association functional class presented higher increase of LGE (p = 0.031) and LGE-rate (p &lt; 0.05) than those with preserved functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in HCM is a progressive and fast phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LGE increment, related to a worse clinical status, is more extensive in apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> than in other patterns </plain></SENT>
