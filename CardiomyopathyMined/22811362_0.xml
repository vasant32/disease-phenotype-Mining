<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Archival tissue samples preserved in formalin are a great source of treasure for biomedical research and diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formalin, though is a good preservative, causes the modification of nucleic acid limiting the application of fixed tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated three methods of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction for constitutive gene expression and pathogen detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) myocardial tissues were subjected to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction by Trizol, <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, and RNeasy FFPE kit followed by RT-PCR and Taqman Real-Time PCR to study the expression of housekeeping genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 myocardial tissues (100%) by RNeasy FFPE kit, as compared to 14/16 by Trizol and 8/10 by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH)was observed in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted by RNeasy FFPE kit and Trizol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High yield of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was obtained by RNeasy FFPE kit than Trizol (P = 0.002) and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>(P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the three methods, RNeasy FFPE kit was evaluated for Enterovirus <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> detection in 16 other histopathologically confirmed FFPE tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) cases and Enterovirus genome was detected in 4/16 (25%) FFPE tissues of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The enteroviral sequences of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> isolates revealed 99% homology with Human coxsackievirus B5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit resulted in significantly high reproducibility of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from FFPE myocardial tissues, which are suitable for amplification by Taq-Man Real-Time and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results show that these FFPE tissues can be used for gene expression, pathogen detection, and epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
