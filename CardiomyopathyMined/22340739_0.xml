<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2001 to 2005, a retrospective analysis of observational database of neonates who were younger than one week old without any risk factors at five tertiary medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory data and possible etiologies were retrospectively collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen neonates presumed to be healthy at birth encountered early near <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in five medical centers in Taipei city </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean gestation age (GA) was 38.5 ± 1.2 weeks, mean birth body weight (BBW) was 2948.2 ± 327.8 gm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age at event was 26 hours old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were rooming-in babies with exclusive breast feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (41.2%) died; seven patients (41.2%) survived with neurological sequelas, and the remaining three patients (17.6%) survived without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible causative factors included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in two cases, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle disorder in one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo> only in one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo> plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> in one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>-related diseases in seven cases and unknown in 4 cases; there was no autopsy case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More effort on promotion of autopsy to discover the underlying disease is necessary and helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To build up an alarm system or protocol for education and early detection is the basis to prevent this tragedy </plain></SENT>
