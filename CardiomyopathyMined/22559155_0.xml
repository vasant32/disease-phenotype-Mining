<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to concerns about the safety of stimulants for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>, novel assessments of the cardiopulmonary impact of these agents are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An open design of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in 15 adults with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a psychiatric evaluation and medical history, subjects underwent echocardiography (TTE) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDX was titrated to 70 mg daily over 6 weeks, followed by monthly visits to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in TTE and CPET measures were examined following up to 6 months of LDX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At endpoint, there were no significant alterations in indices of cardiac systolic performance, or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion (P values &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found significant mean changes in resting LV systolic dimension and Doppler diastolic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Change in heart rate recovery at 1 min met statistical significance (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We did not detect clinically meaningful changes in cardiac structure and function or in metabolic and ventilatory variables at maximum exertion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> adults receiving open LDX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of changes in resting LV dimension and indices of diastolic function are not in the direction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future large sample controlled study can examine these findings, as well as stimulants' impact on heart rate recovery </plain></SENT>
