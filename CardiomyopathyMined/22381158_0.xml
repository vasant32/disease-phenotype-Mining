<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigators report the prevalence, clinical features, and demographics of patients with HC surviving to ���90 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 1,297 patients with HC in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Center database (Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation), 26 (2.0%) were identified who had achieved the age of ≥90 years; 18 (69%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HC diagnosis came late in life, at 61 to 92 years (mean 80 ± 8; ≥75 years in 21 patients), recognized fortuitously by the detection of a heart murmur or during family screening (n = 6) or after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of new symptoms (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At most recent evaluation (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) patients were aged 90 to 96.7 years (mean 92.2 ± 2), with 6 presently alive at 91 to 96 years of age; HC did not appear to be the primary cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular wall thicknesses were 15 to 31 mm (mean 20 ± 3); 8 patients (31%) had obstruction to left ventricular outflow at rest (peak instantaneous gradients, 38 to 135 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant HC-related complications occurred in 13 patients (50%), including progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and nonfatal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no patient died suddenly, 13 (50%) nevertheless carried conventional HC risk markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of cohort patients reached ≥90 years of age (2.0%) than expected in the general population (0.8%) (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HC may be unrecognized until late in life and is consistent with survival to particularly advanced age into the 10th decade of life without the need for major HC-related treatment interventions, and with demise ultimately largely unrelated to this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This principle regarding the natural history of HC can afford a measure of reassurance to many patients </plain></SENT>
