<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) disease process is not only limited to cardiomyocyte abnormalities but also engages the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyaluronan (HA) and its receptor CD44 are involved in cellular growth and tissue proliferation but have so far been less studied in <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In HCM, collagens are abundant but their histological distribution and relation to hyaluronan have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Material and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial specimens from 5 patients with symptomatic left ventricular tract obstruction undergoing myectomy due to HCM were processed for histochemistry and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HA staining was more intense in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The histological distribution of HA was the same in patients and controls, that is, interstitial staining including the space between cardiomyocytes, in fibrous septa, and in the adventitia of intramyocardial blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD44 was not detected in the myocardium of patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collagen I showed the same general localisation as HA but detailed distribution differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first study that describes the distribution of hyaluronan in human HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HA staining is more intense in HCM patients but without coexpression of its receptor CD44, at least not in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HA and collagen I have the same localisation </plain></SENT>
