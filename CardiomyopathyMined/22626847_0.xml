<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we generated cardiac muscle-specific Ate1 knockout mice, in which Ate1 deletion was driven by α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-Ate1 mouse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mice were initially viable, but developed severe cardiac contractility defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> over time, resulting in high rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> after 6months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These symptoms were accompanied by severe ultrastructural defects in cardiac myofibrils, seen in the newborns and far preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, suggesting that these defects were primary and likely underlay the development of the future heart defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several major sarcomeric proteins were arginylated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Ate1 deletion in the hearts resulted in a significant reduction of active and passive myofibril forces, suggesting that arginylation is critical for both myofibril structural integrity and contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, arginylation is essential for maintaining the heart function by regulation of the major myofibril proteins and myofibril forces, and its absence in the heart muscle leads to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> through cardiomyocyte-specific defects </plain></SENT>
