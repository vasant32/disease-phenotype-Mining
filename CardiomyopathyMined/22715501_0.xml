<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, GNT may not always be specific for ApHCM as in this report of apically displaced papillary muscle (ADPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: By retrospectively collecting 12-lead ECGs with a GNT wave and apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> on 2D-ECG from 2008 to 2010, we identified 55 patients with both of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADPM was defined to be present when the base of the papillary muscle originated from the apical one-third of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of ApHCM in patients with apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> but without evidence of ADPM was given otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Careful evaluations of 2D-ECGs suggested that 20% (11/55) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had an ADPM mimicking ApHCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical and echocardiography data were not different between the two except for the maximal T wave on 12-lead ECG and apicoseptal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, suggesting that the differentiation of these two groups may be subtle and difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with ADPM frequently showed abnormal insertion of papillary muscle into the left ventricular outflow tract or into the base of mitral valve leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ADPM may also be present with GNT on 12-lead ECG and emphasizes the careful evaluation of the left ventricular apex for proper diagnosis and discrimination of ApHCM </plain></SENT>
