<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a child, it is associated with a significant risk for anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> under anaesthesia has been attributed to an undiagnosed CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Care of these patients is complicated by the fact that there are several different forms of CM that have differing anaesthesia management goals, aimed at maintaining the patient's baseline haemodynamic variables of preload, heart rate, contractility, and afterload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the emergence of new diagnostic tools, together with advances in cardiac imaging and improved treatment modalities (such as ventricular assist devices), the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> management of a child with a CM is evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review describes the different forms of the disease in terms of pathology, aetiology, and clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive CM are the most common forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examine recent advances in therapy, including the management of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">end-stage disease</z:e>, while highlighting the specific <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> considerations for children with each type of CM </plain></SENT>
