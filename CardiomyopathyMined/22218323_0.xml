<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although serum tenascin-C (TN-C) levels are related to left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and are useful as a prognostic biomarker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, the clinical significance of TN-C levels has not yet been studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to elucidate whether serum TN-C levels are a prognostic biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between serum TN-C levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events was studied in 36 patients with HCM during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of serum TN-C were 28±13 ng/ml (range 11-80 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although patients with LV systolic impairment showed higher TN-C levels than those with preserved LV systolic function (33±11 ng/ml vs. 27±14 ng/ml; p=0.16), TN-C levels were not related to any echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 4.8±1.4 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events were observed in six patients and TN-C levels in patients with events were higher than those in patients without events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the prognosis was worse in patients with high TN-C levels (≥39.2 ng/ml) than in those with low TN-C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> events were more frequently observed in patients with high serum TN-C levels than in those with low TN-C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum TN-C levels may be a new prognostic biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
