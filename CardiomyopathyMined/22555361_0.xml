<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also a strong predictor of mortality in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its prognostic value in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> (CD) or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) remains to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: In this prospective cohort study, HGF concentrations were measured in patients with CD (n = 91), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n = 47), and control subjects (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While no difference was detected for patients with New York Heart Association class I-II, HGF was significantly increased in advanced HF patients (New York Heart Association class III-IV) in both CD and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> groups, compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between HGF and left ventricular ejection fraction in CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no correlation in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite its strong correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction in CD patients, HGF failed to predict mortality and necessity for heart transplant in both CD and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Although HGF can be significantly increased in advanced HF patients with CD and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, its prognostic value for endpoints is minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the formerly described predictive power for HGF in HF might be restricted to specific etiologies of HF </plain></SENT>
