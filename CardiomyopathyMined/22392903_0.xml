<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> induced by pressure overload in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> is attributed to excess pathological deposition of extracellular matrix components, the mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent reports revealed that α-smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts are primarily responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is believed that myofibroblasts are differentiated from resident fibroblasts, whereas the transformation of vascular endothelial cells into myofibroblasts, known as endothelial-mesenchymal transition, has been suggested to be intimately associated with perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that HGF prevents <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> by blocking these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the pressure-overloaded HGF-transgenic mouse model made by transverse aortic constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human coronary artery endothelial cells and human cardiac fibroblasts were examined in vitro after being treated with transforming growth factor-β1 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> with or without HGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> significantly decreased in pressure-overloaded HGF-transgenic mice compared with pressure-overloaded nontransgenic controls, particularly in the perivascular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>-related genes and by significant preservation of echocardiographic measurements of cardiac function in the HGF-transgenic mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival rate 2 months after transverse aortic constriction was higher by 45% (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HGF inhibited the differentiation of human coronary artery endothelial cells into myofibroblasts induced by transforming growth factor-β1 and the phenotypic conversion of human cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HGF reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> by inhibiting endothelial-mesenchymal transition and the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
