<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As evident by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> following cardiac-specific Dicer knockdown they also are required for maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac contractile function but the specific role of miR-1 in the process is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the role of miR-1 in particular and to identify its specific targets we created a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-inducible, cardiac-specific Dicer knockdown mouse and demonstrated that Dicer downregulation results in a dramatic and rapid decline in cardiac function concurrent with significantly reduced levels of miR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of miR-1 was established by miR-1 antagomir treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, which replicated the cardiac-specific Dicer knockdown phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of miR-1 was associated with up-regulation of its predicted target Sorcin, an established modulator of calcium signaling and excitation-contraction coupling, subsequently verified as a miR-1 target with luciferase constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sorcin effectively rescued the cardiac phenotypes after Dicer or miR-1 knockdown affirming Sorcin as a critical mediator of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regulatory relationship between miR-1 and Sorcin was further confirmed in cultured mouse cardiomyocytes where modulation of miR-1 was associated with discordant Sorcin levels and dysregulation of calcium signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological relevance of our findings included decreased miR-1 and increased Sorcin expression in end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate the importance of miR-1 in cardiac function and in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> via Sorcin-dependent calcium homeostasis </plain></SENT>
