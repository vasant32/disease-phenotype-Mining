<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed analysis of data reported to UNOS for children who underwent primary heart transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from January 1994 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups depending on their pre-transplant TPG: no-PHTN (TPG ≤ 12 mmHg) and PHTN (TPG &gt;12 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 6139 children underwent transplantation of whom 2456 (40%) were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>; 1322 (54%) of these had catheterization data available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PHTN group (mean TPG 19.5 ± 8.6) had 312 patients and no-PHTN (TPG 6.7 ± 4.0) had 1010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality at one month (4.5% vs. 2.3%) and three months (6.1% vs. 3.1%) post-transplant was significantly higher in the PHTN than the no-PHTN group with an odds ratio of 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect of PHTN on early mortality in children &lt;1 yr age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant improvement in early survival for transplants performed after compared to before 2003 in patients with PHTN despite availability of pulmonary dilators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-transplant PHTN increases early post-transplant mortality in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients above one yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There has been no significant improvement in the outcome of this group over the last seven yr </plain></SENT>
