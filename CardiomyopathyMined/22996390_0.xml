<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To optimize and validate a modified cine inversion recovery sequence (MCine-IR) for myocardial T1 quantification and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> partition coefficient (λ(Gd) ) estimation at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original version of the cine inversion recovery sequence was modified to allow fully transverse magnetization recovery between two successive inversion pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty heart phases were acquired from a number of heart cycles determined on a patient heart rate basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phantom studies were carried out to find the optimal effective TR for myocardial and blood pool T1 quantifications in pre- and postcontrast studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients with myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (MI) and 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) were investigated, as well as 11 healthy subjects used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Effective TR was identified to be 5000 msec and 2000 msec, respectively, for pre- and postcontrast studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A longer precontrast (948 ± 102 msec) and shorter postcontrast (348 ± 27 msec) T1 in ischemic patients relative to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (815 ± 98 msec, P = 0.03 and 409 ± 42 msec, P = 0.001) were noted in delayed enhancement (DE) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MI patients λ(Gd) resulted higher than in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in DE areas (609 ± 167 vs. 422 ± 52, P = 0.01) but lower in segments not exhibiting DE (355 ± 100 vs. 398 ± 54, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was feasible to measure T1 and λ(Gd) with MCine-IR and the results were in good agreement with the literature </plain></SENT>
