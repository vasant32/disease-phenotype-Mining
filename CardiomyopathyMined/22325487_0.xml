<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method This study is a retrospective review of records of Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus-positive children with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular fractional shortening, CD4 percentage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, and nutritional status were compared before and during antiretroviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed the records of 34 Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus-positive children with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 18 patients received antiretroviral therapy (group one) and 16 were antiretroviral therapy naive (group two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of group one at initial visit was 94 months, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, 17 children showed improved left ventricular function on treatment, with an increase in fractional shortening (median: 17-33.5%; p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant statistical difference between the groups regarding initial fractional shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group one, the CD4 percentage improved (median: 12% to 30.5%; p less than 0.0001), with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load suppression (median: 24,900 copies per millilitre to less than 25 copies per millilitre; p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in group one (median z-score: -1.70 to -1.32; p equal to 0.0083) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proper statistical analysis in group two was not possible because of poor follow-up of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion The findings are in keeping with other reports that have shown improvement in left ventricular function in patients with Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recovery of myocardial function is associated with improvement in immunological and nutritional statuses </plain></SENT>
