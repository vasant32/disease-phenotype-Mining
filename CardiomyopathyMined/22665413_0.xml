<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plan (SCAMP) standardizes the care of patients with a predefined diagnosis while actively inviting and collecting data on clinician deviations (DEVs) from its recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For 3 different pediatric cardiac diagnoses managed by SCAMPs, we determined the frequency of, types of, and reasons for DEVs, which are considered to be a valuable source of information and innovation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DEVs were collected as part of SCAMP implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DEVs were reviewed by the SCAMP committee chairperson and by a separate protocol deviation committee; they were characterized as either justifiable (J), possibly justifiable (PJ), or not justifiable (NJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed 415 patients, 484 clinic encounters, and 216 DEVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six (39.8%) of the DEVs were J, 21 (9.7%) were PJ, and 109 (50.4%) were NJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of NJ DEVs relative to the number of opportunities for DEV was 4.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>J and PJ DEVs were mostly due to management of unrelated conditions (11% overall) or special circumstances (22% overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NJ DEVs primarily involved follow-up intervals (66%) and deleted tests (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reason for deviating from SCAMP recommendations was not given for 31% of DEVs, even though such information was requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall low rate of NJ DEV suggests that practitioners generally accept SCAMP recommendations, but improved capture of practitioners' reasons for deviating from those recommendations is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed multiple opportunities for improving patient care, suggesting that this process can be useful in both promulgating sound practice and evolving improved approaches to patient management </plain></SENT>
