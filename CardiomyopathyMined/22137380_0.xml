<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These pathological conditions can sometimes occur concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005200'>retroperitoneal fibrosis</z:hpo> and inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> are both characterized by the presence of fibro-inflammatory tissue around the abdominal aorta expanding into the surrounding retroperitoneal structures, and together they may be termed '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> periaortitis' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular fibrosclerosis has become non-uncommonly encountered condition since imaging modalities have made its diagnosis more feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that a certain fraction, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of cardiovascular fibrosclerosis may have a link with immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4)-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG4-SD is histologically characterized by dense fibrosclerosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells, and these histopathologic findings seem to be essentially similar regardless of the organs involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this mini review, we summarize what is known so far about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0866608,C0494949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multifocal fibrosclerosis</z:e> of the cardiovascular system and its association with IgG4-SD, and what remains to be clarified in future investigations </plain></SENT>
