<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (PPCM) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> of the heart muscle that affects women with previously unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0404746" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases during pregnancy</z:e> or in the first months after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardinal symptoms are dyspnoea and fluid retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, cardiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and other clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction may also herald this uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence of PPCM shows large regional variations: in Europe and the United States it is between 1:2000 and 1:4000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The markedly higher incidence rates observed in Haitian or South African women (up to 1:300) suggest that genetic or environmental factors may play a pathogenetic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying aetiology of PPCM still is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides genetic susceptibility an abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> against cardiac tissue components, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or an irregular activity of cathepsin D generating a potentially cardio-toxic splice variant of prolactin have been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New therapeutic strategies as immune modulation or prolactin inhibition were therefore suggested, but are not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies focus on the standard therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy is limited to substances without fetotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But even with optimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy the course of the disease exhibits large variations ranging from full recovery to deterioration of heart function and even early cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review cumulates the current knowledge on PPCM and aims to raise awareness for this rare and potentially life-threatening disorder amongst <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medical professionals involved in the care for pregnant women </plain></SENT>
