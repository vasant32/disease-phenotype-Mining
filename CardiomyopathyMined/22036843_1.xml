<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the pathogenicity of a homozygous Asp446Asn mutation in the NDUFS2 gene of a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342776" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complex I deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of the NDUFS2 patient were compared with those of 4 patients with previously identified NDUFS2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3 out of 5 showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex I amounts in the patient carrying the Asp446Asn mutation were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while the complex I activity was strongly reduced, showing that the NDUFS2 mutation affects complex I enzymatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the 4 other NDUFS2 patients showed both a reduced amount and activity of complex I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic defect in fibroblasts of the patient carrying the Asp446Asn mutation was rescued by transduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> NDUFS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 3-D model of the catalytic core of complex I showed that the mutated amino acid residue resides near the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q binding pocket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the K(M) of complex I for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q analogs of the Asp446Asn mutated complex I was similar to the K(M) observed in other complex I defects and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that the mutation interferes with the reduction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q or with the coupling of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q reduction with the conformational changes involved in proton pumping of complex I </plain></SENT>
