<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological studies with NET inhibitors showed that NET has opposing effects on cardiovascular sympathetic regulation in the brain and in the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NET is involved in the distribution of sympathetic activity between vasculature, heart, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic NET dysfunction is a rare cause of the postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The condition is characterized by excessive adrenergic stimulation of the heart, particularly with standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, NET inhibition may be beneficial in hypoadrenergic states, such as central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e>, or neurally mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, which results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sympathetic withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies suggested reduced NET function in some patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cardiac NET function appears to be reduced in common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether NET dysfunction is a consequence or cause of progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in human subjects requires further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, studies with the non selective NET inhibitor sibutramine suggest that reduced NET function could have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the widespread use of medications inhibiting NET, the issue deserves more attention </plain></SENT>
