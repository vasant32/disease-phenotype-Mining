<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated pathways are known to contribute to cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> due to Dox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improving the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses of cardiomyocytes could be one strategy for cardiac protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (Vit C), a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, on Dox-induced cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult rat cardiomyocytes were incubated for 24 h with Dox (0.01-10 μM), with and without different concentrations of Vit C (5-100 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to Dox (10 μM) resulted in a 98% increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) release, 70% increase in p53 as well as ASK-1 activation, 40% increase in p38 activation, 30% increase in pro-apoptotic Bax over anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl ratio and caspase activation, and about 20% reduction in cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vit C (25 μM) was able to mitigate Dox-induced changes by decreasing ROS and CK release by 50%, reducing p53 activation by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in ASK-1 and p38 was also significantly mitigated, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was reduced while cardiomyocytes viability was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows that Dox-induced cardiomyocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is mediated by a direct membrane effect as well as intracytoplasmic changes promoting the cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a nutritional approach of using Vit C for preventing Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and better management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
