<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Material and METHODS: Consecutive HIV-infected patients of age &gt;13 years were studied for 3 months, after obtaining their consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After clinical assessment, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, 2-dimensional echocardiography and serum Troponin T levels were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> was observed in the x-ray of 15% of them, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo> was seen in 18%, 2-dimensional echocardiography was abnormal in 67%; and diastolic dysfunction (42.8%) was the commonest abnormality followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum troponin T was elevated in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variables, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> (OIs), antiretroviral therapy (ART), stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e>, and CD4 counts, did not affect the frequency of diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diastolic dysfunction is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> observed in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
