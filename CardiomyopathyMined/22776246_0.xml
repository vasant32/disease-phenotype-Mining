<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ixmyelocel-T is produced under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) in a fully closed, automated system that expands mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the cell types in ixmyelocel-T are the same as those found in the bone marrow, the numbers of MSCs and alternative macrophages are greater in ixmyelocel-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that the mixture of expanded MSCs and alternatively activated macrophages promote long-term tissue repair of ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The multiple cell types in ixmyelocel-T have a range of biological activities that are likely to contribute to a complex mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial data collected to date support the potential for ixmyelocel-T as an efficacious and safe treatment for ischemic cardiovascular indications, including critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (CLI) and a severe form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CLI clinical program has completed phase 2 and has reached concurrence with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a phase 3 study (REVIVE) through the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phase 3 study began screening patients in February 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> clinical program will initiate phase 2b in 2012 </plain></SENT>
