<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We experienced a patient with intractable VT storm controlled by hemodynamic unloading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had mid-septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) back-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the severe mid-septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, his left ventricle (LV) had an hourglass-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and showed apical ballooning; the focus of VT was at the border of apical ballooning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although we performed VT ablation because of electrical storm with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks, VT recurred 1 hour after procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the post-RFCA monomorphic VT was refractory to anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock, we reduced the hemodynamic overload of LV with β-blockade, hydration, and sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VT spontaneously stopped 1.5 hours later and the patient has remained free of VT for 24 months with β-blockade alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with VT storm refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs or RFCA, the mechanism of mechano-electrical feedback should be considered and hemodynamic unloading may be an essential component of treatment </plain></SENT>
