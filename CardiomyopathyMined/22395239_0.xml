<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and hemodynamic correlates of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) levels in ABS and compare the biomarker profiles in ABS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven prospectively diagnosed patients with ABS whose BNP and troponin T level measurements were available were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) and 25 individuals with non-ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (NSTEMI) were included as matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the ABS cohort, the BNP levels were higher in patients older than 65 years compared with younger individuals: 767 (269, 951) versus 340 (131, 904.5), P=0.019 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between BNP levels and hemodynamic parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction and end diastolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no correlations between BNP and peak troponin T (r=0.03, P=0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BNP levels were significantly higher in ABS patients when compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and NSTEMI controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BNP to peak troponin T ratio was significantly higher in ABS compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> controls 1089.4 (446.7, 3334.8) versus 97.4 (17.9, 264.7), P=0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BNP elevation is almost universal in ABS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac hemodynamic indices do not correlate with BNP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of BNP elevation is higher in ABS compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and NSTEMI </plain></SENT>
