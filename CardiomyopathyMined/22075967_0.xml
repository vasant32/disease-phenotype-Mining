<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p53 and its downstream <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> assembly protein, synthesis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase 2 (SCO2), are important regulators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration, whereas the involvement in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The role of p53 and SCO2 in energy metabolism was examined in both type I (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> [STZ] administration) and type II diabetic (db/db) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac expressions of p53 and SCO2 in 4-week STZ diabetic mice were upregulated (185% and 152% versus controls, respectively, P&lt;0.01), with a marked decrease in cardiac performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption was increased (136% versus control, P&lt;0.01) in parallel with augmentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase (complex IV) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-damaged myocytes and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation were increased in association with membrane-localization of fatty acid translocase protein FAT/CD36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> tempol reduced the increased expressions of p53 and SCO2 in STZ-diabetic hearts and normalized alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation, and cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in db/db mice, whereas in p53-deficient or SCO2-deficient diabetic mice, the cardiac and <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> were prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SCO2 in cardiac myocytes increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS and fatty acid accumulation, whereas knockdown of SCO2 ameliorated them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial p53/SCO2 signal is activated by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-mediated ROS generation to increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxygen consumption, resulting in excessive generation of mitochondria-derived ROS and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in association with cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
