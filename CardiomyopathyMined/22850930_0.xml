<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> (CS) leads to substantial morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial for patients with CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography used to be considered a useful diagnostic tool for patients with CS, but CS may clinically present as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate whether a novel three-dimensional (3-D) speckle-tracking strain can identify patients with CS more accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 23 CS patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 46 ± 10 %, and 16 EF-matched patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (EF 45 ± 11 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global radial (GRS), circumferential (GCS) and longitudinal (GLS) strain was assessed using 3-D speckle-tracking system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GRS of patients with CS was significantly lower than that of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (18.5 ± 8.4 vs. 28.5 ± 8.3 %, p &lt; 0.01), but GCS and GLS in patients with CS and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GRS ≦ 21.1 could differentiate CS from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with a sensitivity of 70 %, specificity of 88 % and area under the curve of 0.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional noteworthy findings was that, patients with CS showed more negative radial strain curves than did those with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (1.7 ± 2.3 vs. 0.1 ± 0.5, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 3-D speckle-tracking radial strain shows good potential to distinguish CS from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations can thus be expected to have clinical implications for management of CS patients </plain></SENT>
