<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) occurs in an estimated 0.8 to 6.2 per 100 000 children annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> causing SCD in asymptomatic children has public appeal because of its apparent potential to avert tragedy; however, performance of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a screening tool is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated (1) phenotypic (ECG- or echocardiogram [ECHO]-based) prevalence of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679381" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pediatric disorders</z:e> associated with SCD, and (2) sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of ECG, alone or with ECHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo>, the 3 most common disorders associated with SCD and detectable by ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified and screened 6954 abstracts, yielding 396 articles, and extracted data from 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary phenotypic prevalences per 100 000 asymptomatic children were 45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-79) for HCM, 7 (95% CI: 0-14) for LQTS, and 136 (95% CI: 55-218) for Wolff-Parkinson-White </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for ECG were 0.91 for detecting HCM and 0.92 for LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive value of detecting either HCM or LQTS by using ECG was high; however, the positive predictive value varied by different sensitivity and specificity cut-points and the true prevalence of the conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results provide an evidence base for evaluating pediatric screening for these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECG, alone or with ECHO, was a sensitive test for mass screening and negative predictive value was high, but positive predictive value and false-positive rates varied </plain></SENT>
