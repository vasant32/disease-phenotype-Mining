<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The threshold dose for development of clinically significant RIHD is believed to be lower than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, research into mechanisms of RIHD has gained substantial momentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RIHD becomes clinically apparent ten to fifteen years after radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> manifestations of RIHD include <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and valve abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reducing exposure of the heart during radiotherapy is the only known method of preventing RIHD, and there are no approaches to reverse RIHD once it occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We use a combination of pharmacological and genetic animal models to determine biological mechanisms of RIHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major technological advances in small animal research have made this type of study more valuable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The long-term goal of this work is to identify targets for intervention in RIHD, thereby enhancing the efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
