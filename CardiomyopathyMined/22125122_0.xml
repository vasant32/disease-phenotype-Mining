<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (AHCM) is a relatively rare form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), originally described in Japan and later in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on this disease in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to describe clinical features and prognoses of patients with AHCM in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 208 consecutive patients with AHCM examined at FuWai Hospital was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, mortality, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 208 patients with AHCM represented 16.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 64.4% were pure form and 35.6% were mixed form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the pure group, the mixed group had a significantly larger left atrial diameter and thicker apical thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred ninety-nine patients had a mean follow-up of 8.0 ± 3.5 years, cardiovascular mortality was 1.0%, and annual cardiovascular mortality was 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2 cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were both mixed form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival was 97.0 ± 2% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 17.8% had 1 or more cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival without morbid events at 10 years was 77 ± 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> were identified: age at diagnosis ≥60 years, left atrial diameter ≥36 mm, and New York Heart Association class ≥III at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AHCM is relatively high, and it has a benign prognosis in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, 17.8% of patients may develop cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is important to distinguish the 2 phenotypes of AHCM; the mixed form is less common but more serious than the pure form </plain></SENT>
