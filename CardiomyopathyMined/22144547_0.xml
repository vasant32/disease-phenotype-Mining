<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies are limited by sample size, cross-sectional design, and few data in relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-two unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> probands were screened for TNNT2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives were invited for clinical and genetic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two individuals (20 probands and 72 relatives) carried TNNT2 mutations (51 [55%] male; 30±17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECGs and echo were available in 87 (95%) and 88 (96%) individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 13 (68%) children (&lt;16 years) and 13 (19%) adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echo was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 18 (90%) children and 16 (24%) adults; 7 (10%) adults had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG and echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (65%) of 20 families had a history of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available for 75 patients (mean, 9.9±5.2 years); 2 of 16 adults and 2 of 18 children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echoes developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (22%) received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (20 for primary prophylaxis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One child and 3 adults died of SCD and 2 adults were resuscitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had an appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, transplant, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge was 1.6% (0.016 person/y; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-2.79%), and SCD 0.93% (0.0093 person/y; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> is rare in children with TNNT2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> is absent in the minority of adults, but most have an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite adverse family histories, the rate of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during follow-up was similar to that reported in large referral populations </plain></SENT>
