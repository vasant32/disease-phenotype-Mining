<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, lack of dystrophin disrupts the recruitment of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) to the sarcolemma thus affecting nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utrophin is a dystrophin homolog whose expression is greatly upregulated in the sarcolemma of dystrophin-negative fibers from mdx mice, a mouse model of DMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, little is known about the NO signaling pathway in cardiac muscle of DMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we used cardiomyocytes and hearts from two month-old mdx and mdx:utrophin (-/-) double knockout mice (mdx:utr) to study key steps in NO signaling: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> transporters, NOS, and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>nNOS did not co-localize with dystrophin or utrophin to the cardiomyocyte membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this, nNOS activity was markedly decreased in both mdx and mdx:utr mice while nNOS expression was only decreased in mdx:utr hearts, suggesting that utrophin upregulation in cardiomyocytes maintains nNOS levels but not function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sGC protein levels and activity remained at control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> transporter expression and function were significantly increased, suggesting a novel biochemical compensatory mechanism of the NO pathway and a potential entry site for therapeutics </plain></SENT>
