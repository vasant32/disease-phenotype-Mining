<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous septal ablation by alcohol-induced septal branch occlusion was introduced as a new treatment option in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HOCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate procedural and long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients with HOCM treated by alcohol septal ablation (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 14 consecutive HOCM patients undergoing percutaneous <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (66.4 +/- 12.1 years, 71.4% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presented persistent symptoms despite optimized medical treatment, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a peak gradient &gt; 50 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and ventricular septal thickness &gt; or = 15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was considered successful when the LVOT pressure gradient fell to less than 50% of baseline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had echocardiographic evaluation at baseline, intraprocedure and at follow-up, and a long-term clinical follow-up (25 +/- 38 months) with evaluation of functional class and occurrence of symptoms or cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percutaneous <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> achieved a 71.4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 85.7% long-term success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak LVOT gradient decreased from 104 +/- 40 mmHg at baseline to 58 +/- 30 mmHg intraprocedure (p = 0.03) and 35 +/- 26 mmHg at follow-up (p = 0.001); total gradient decrease was 75 +/- 43 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ventricular septal thickness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> also presented significant decreases during follow-up (from 24 +/- 5 mm to 18 +/- 4 mm, p = 0.02, and from grade 2.4 +/- 0.6 to 1.4 +/- 0.5, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A tendency for long-term improvement in NYHA functional class (from 2.6 +/- 1.1 to 1.8 +/- 1.4, p = 0.09) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications occurred in 6.7% of patients; two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred in-hospital, but no long-term clinical events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is an effective treatment for symptomatic patients with HOCM, obtaining a marked decrease in LVOT pressure gradient and symptomatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the occurrence of a significant number of procedural complications, the favorable long-term outcomes underline the potential of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> as a percutaneous alternative to surgical myectomy </plain></SENT>
