<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, PKC β-II is considered as a potent drug target and the crystal structure of the kinase domain of PKC β-II (PDB id: 2I0E) was used to design inhibitors using Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty inhibitors structurally similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">Staurosporine</z:chebi> were retrieved from PubChem Compound database and High Throughput Virtual screening (HTVs) was carried out with PKC β-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the HTVs results and the nature of active site residues of PKC β-II, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">Staurosporine</z:chebi> inhibitors were designed using SBDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induced Fit Docking (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IFD</z:e>) studies were carried out between kinase domain of PKC β-II and the designed inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IFD</z:e> complexes showed favorable docking score, glide energy, glide emodel and hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with the active site of PKC β-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding free energy was calculated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IFD</z:e> complexes using Prime MM-GBSA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conformational changes induced by the inhibitor at the active site of PKC β-II were observed for the back bone Cα atoms and side-chain chi angles </plain></SENT>
