<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (VTs) are an important reason for postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the VT substrate, VT characteristics, and outcome of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in patients with VT after SVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve (3%) of 416 patients referred for RFCA for VT after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in three centers had undergone SVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After induction of VT, left ventricular (LV) electroanatomical mapping was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ablation target sites were identified by entrainment, substrate, and/or pace mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four (33%) patients presented within the perioperative period with incessant VT, and eight (67%) presented with incessant or recurrent VT late after SVR (VT cycle length 453 ± 102 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region of surgical scar was identified by electroanatomical mapping in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight VTs (cycle length 384 ± 95 ms) were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VT exit was bordering the surgical scar in 20 (71%) VTs, of which 15 were at the septal side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> VTs were abolished in five patients: in four only the clinical VTs were abolished, and in one reinducibility was not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two patients, ablation failed after which surgical ablation was performed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, three (25%) patients died (nonarrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had presented early after SVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two (17%) experienced recurrent VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VT after LV SVR seems to have a bimodal presentation; one-third presented with incessant VT in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative phase and had a high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds presented late after SVR; in these patients RFCA is usually effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation sites are frequently located at the border of surgical scars and patch material </plain></SENT>
