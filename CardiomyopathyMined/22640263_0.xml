<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Apical and midventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) are rare variants of HCM, in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> is located mainly at the midventricular to apical levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart transplantation was the only possible surgical solution for many of these patients; however, transapical myectomy represents another good alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our surgical technique of apical ventriculotomy for apical and midventricular myectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: A 6-cm incision is made at the apex of the heart lateral to the left anterior descending coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apical ventriculotomy provides excellent exposure of the midventricle for midventricular myectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apical approach also allows access to the left ventricle for apical myectomy to enlarge the chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During apical myectomy, particular care is necessary to avoid injury to papillary muscles, which are often displaced with apical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secure closure of the ventriculotomy can be achieved with a double layer of suture reinforced with felt, and no complications of false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The transapical approach provides excellent exposure of the apex and midventricle, and the technique is useful when myectomy is aimed at eliminating the ventricular obstruction and/or enlarging the left ventricular cavity size in patients with apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
