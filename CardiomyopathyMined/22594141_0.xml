<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who had biopsy-proven AFLP complicated by PPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chart review and literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient is a 22-year-old G5P1213 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> African-American female who presented at 30 weeks gestation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressures and mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After completion of a 24 hour urine protein collection that was consistent with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, an induction of labor with uncomplicated vaginal delivery was accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following delivery, a computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An echocardiogram revealed global dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver biopsy showed AFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attempts to establish a unifying etiology were unrevealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PPCM was treated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and intravenous immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical status deteriorated, eventually requiring continuous dialysis, intubation, pharmacologic and mechanical inotropic support, and a feeding tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged to a long-term care facility where she subsequently passed away from multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AFLP and PPCM are rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
