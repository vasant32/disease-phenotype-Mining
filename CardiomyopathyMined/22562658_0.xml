<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess myocardial scar size and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> as predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in CRT candidates.METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of 78 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and class I indication for CRT-D were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before CRT-D implantation, a contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (ce-CMR) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The core and border zone (BZ) of the myocardial scar were characterized and quantified with a customized post-processing software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy was considered as a surrogate of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 25 months (25-75th percentiles, 15-34), appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy occurred in 11.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model for clinical and ce-CMR variables, the scar mass percentage [hazards ratio (HR) per 1% increase 1.1 (1.06-1.15), P &lt; 0.01], the BZ mass [HR per 1 g increase 1.06 (1.04-1.09), P &lt; 0.01], and the BZ percentage of the scar [HR per 1% increase 1.06 (1.02-1.11), P &lt; 0.01], were the only independent predictors of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a scar mass &lt;16% and a BZ &lt; 9.5 g had a negative predictive value of 100%.CONCLUSIONS: The presence, size, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of myocardial scar independently predict appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies in CRT candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ce-CMR-based scar analysis might help identify a subgroup of patients at relatively low risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
