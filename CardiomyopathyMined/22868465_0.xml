<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on this case, we considered that the combination therapy of CRT and MVR with bileaflet preservation might be one of the effective strategies for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> due to end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
