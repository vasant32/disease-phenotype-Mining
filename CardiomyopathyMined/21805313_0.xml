<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) is challenging due to limitations of several non-invasive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one asymptomatic patients with complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> who were referred for CMR from January 2005 to November 2010 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>29 patients (18 men) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiograms (echo) whereas 25 (18 men) had abnormal findings on echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six had no echo and one had poor echo windows, and these patients were excluded from further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiac symptoms or known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> at the time of referral were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echo, 9 (31%) were found to have pathological findings on CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n = 6, 21%) followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (n = 2, 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 patients who had an abnormal echo, CMR confirmed the diagnosis in 19 (76%) and provided clinically relevant additional information in 13 (52%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 13 patients, 9 (69%) had characteristic patterns of myocardial late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (8 mid-wall and 1 patchy distribution consistent with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoid</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CMR detects sub-clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in a third of asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003116'>abnormal echocardiograms</z:hpo>, CMR provides additional clinically relevant information in over 50% of patients, including a high prevalence of mid-wall <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005162'>impaired left ventricular function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings support the use of CMR as a valuable adjunct to conventional investigations in asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
