<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the incorporation of routine ECG in pre-participation screening remains controversial, there is increasing evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and ion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e> have ECG changes as the initial manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in young people show significant geographical variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine the prevalence and spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in a young male South-East Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Singapore Armed Forces Electrocardiogram and Echocardiogram (SAFE) protocol is an ECG-based pre-participation cardiac screening programme modelled after the Italian system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From October 2008 to May 2009, a total of 18 476 young male conscripts (mean age 19.5 years old, range 16-27) underwent mandatory pre-enlistment medical screening at a single medical facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> findings were classified into two groups: Group A had ECG changes that fulfilled a pre-specified checklist to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and were referred for transthoracic echocardiogram; Group B had other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> [such as Brugada pattern, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern, long QTc] and were referred for secondary screening at a tertiary institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 476 subjects screened, 7.0% (n= 1285) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, 19 (0.10%) had Brugada pattern, 25 (0.14%) had WPW pattern, and 31 (0.17%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> on ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> was significantly higher in Chinese than in South Asians (7.2 vs. 5.7%, P= 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in a young, South-East Asian male population was 7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant ethnic differences, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> more prevalent in Chinese than in South Asians (7.2 vs. 5.7%, P= 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of universal ECG, in addition to history and physical examination, may increase the sensitivity of a cardiovascular screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the spectrum and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> and disease conditions would be pivotal in designing customized screening programmes </plain></SENT>
