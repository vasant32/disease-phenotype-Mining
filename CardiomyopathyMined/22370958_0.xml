<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the role of renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system blockade with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi>, a direct renin inhibitor, in the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster (SCH) model, we treated 1-month-old SCH with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> (10 mg·kg·d) over a 4-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparative purposes, we also evaluated the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> (10 mg·kg·d) and the combination of both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-matched golden hamsters were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and diastolic function were determined by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was also measured in the left femoral artery by sphygmomanometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results indicate that at 2 months of age, SBP is higher in SCH than in controls, and administration for 1 month of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi>, or the combination of these drugs normalized SBP in SCH to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5-month-old SCH, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> improved ejection fraction (from 48.6% ± 5.8% to 69.4% ± 3.2%, n = 5, P &lt; 0.05), left ventricular end-systolic volume (from 0.28 ± 0.06 to 0.10 ± 0.01 mL/100 g body weight), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (from 0.61 ± 0.05 to 0.34 ± 0.02 mL/100 g body weight), and normalized diastolic function (E:A ratio increases from 0.93 ± 0.13 to 1.70 ± 0.03, n = 5, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> or the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in this animal model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> is as effective as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi>, or the combination of both drugs, in improving diastolic function and in preventing the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">aliskiren</z:chebi> may be used as a monotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies, however, are needed to assess the effectiveness of this drug in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
