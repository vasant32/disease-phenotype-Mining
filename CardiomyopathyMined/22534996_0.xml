<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, the chief factor in the high mortality rate associated with the illness, affects more than half a million Brazilians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its evolution may result in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> associated with loss of functional capacity and quality of life, with important social and medical/labor consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown the beneficial effect of regular exercise on cardiac patients, but few of them have focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Chagas' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study evaluated the effects of an exercise program on the functional capacity of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> who were treated in outpatient clinics at the Evandro Chagas Institute of Clinical Research and the National Institute of Cardiology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exercises were performed 3 times a week for 1 h (30 min of aerobic activity and 30 min of resistance exercises and extension) over 6 months in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional capacity was evaluated by comparing the direct measurement of the O₂ uptake volume (VO₂) obtained by a cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after the program (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (13 females) were followed, with minimum and maximum ages of 30 and 72 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed an average increase of VO(2peak) &gt; 10% (p = 0.01949) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a statistically significant improvement in functional capacity with regular exercise of the right intensity </plain></SENT>
