<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a syndrome of transient left ventricular dysfunction following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> emotional or physical stress without obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The leading hypothesis for the etiology is stress-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> surge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: People taking outpatient β-adrenergic receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> therapy have less-severe presentation and clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from October 2005 to January 2011 by analyzing our cardiac-catheterization database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical records and angiograms were reviewed by 2 experienced observers independently to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We collected clinical, demographic, laboratory, and angiographic data for the identified patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then compared the severity of myocardial dysfunction or damage (cardiac enzymes, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction) between patients taking outpatient β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenergic antagonist</z:chebi> therapy upon admission vs those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arrival and peak values for cardiac enzymes were analyzed when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of parameters related to the severity of myocardial dysfunction or damage was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Means for age were compared using the Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05 (2-tailed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 64 patients identified, 16 (25%) were on one of 3 β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenergic antagonists</z:chebi> on presentation: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> succinate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi>, or atenolol, with mean doses of 75 mg daily, 52.5 mg twice daily, and 37.5 mg daily, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients on β-blockers were older (mean age 73.1 years vs 66 years; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in levels of cardiac enzymes, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or left ventricular ejection fraction between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prior therapy with low-dose β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenergic antagonists</z:chebi> does not affect the severity of presentation and clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> as measured by common markers of myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
