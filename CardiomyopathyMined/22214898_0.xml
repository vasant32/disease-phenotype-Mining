<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent comprehensive desmosome mutation analyses of Caucasian ARVC patients have revealed the presence of not only a single heterozygous mutation, but also compound and digenic heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic basis of Japanese ARVC remains poorly elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects were 7 definite and 1 possible ARVC probands (6 males, 16-76 years of age), and their family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic screening for major ARVC-causing genes (junction plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2 (PKP2), desmoglein-2 (DSG2), and desmocollin-2) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 3 cases of compound heterozygosities (Case 1: DSG2 S194L and DSG2 R292C; Case 2: PKP2 2489+1G&gt;A and PKP2 D812N; Case 3: PKP2 M565R and PKP2 D812N) and 1 of digenic heterozygosity (Case 4: PKP2 1728_1729insGATG and DSG2 R292C) among the definite ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> family members we investigated have remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They carried, if any, only a single variant, indicating that the probands carry in trans compound heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that each of these variants alone may not be sufficient and second variants may be required to manifest overt ARVC in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive genetic analysis of desmosome genes identified 3 cases of compound heterozygosities in trans and 1 of digenic heterozygosity among 7 definite Japanese ARVC patients, providing novel insights into the genetic basis of Japanese ARVC </plain></SENT>
