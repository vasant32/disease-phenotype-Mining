<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin light chain is the most common, amyloid A the longest recognized, and transthyretin-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (ATTR) the most frequent inherited systemic form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ATTR, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> disease, is associated with at least 100 different transthyretin (TTR) mutations, the single amino-acid substitution of methionine for valine at position 30 is the most common mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each variant has a different organ involvement, although clinical differences attributed to environmental and genetic factors exist within the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>Peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are broadly described, and insights into disease reveal that kidney impairment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> are also clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review combines clinical and laboratory findings of renal involvement from the main geographic regions of disease occurrence and for different mutations of TTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen nephropathic variants have been described, but the TTR V30M mutation is the best documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>Nephropathy</z:hpo> affects patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, low penetrance in the family, and cardiac dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> can be the disorder's first presentation, even before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amyloid renal deposits commonly occur, even in the absence of urinary abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The experience with renal replacement therapy is based on hemodialysis, which is associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because TTR is synthesized mainly in the liver, liver transplantation has been considered an acceptable treatment; simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation is recommended to avoid recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the kidney-safety profile of new drugs in development may soon be available </plain></SENT>
