<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When it does occur, it usually happens in active individuals, often while they are participating in physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on the population's characteristics, the most common causes of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in these subjects are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, congenital coronary abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the presence of a structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart (ion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e> or abnormal conduction pathways), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right-ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography (2-DE) has been proposed as a screening tool that can potentially detect four of these five causes of SCA, and many groups now sponsor community-based 2-DE SCA-screening programs. "Basic" 2-DE screening may include assessment of ventricular volumes, mass, and function; left atrial size; and cardiac and thoracic vascular (including coronary) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>. "Advanced" echocardiographic techniques, such as tissue Doppler and strain imaging, can help in diagnosis when the history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and/or standard 2-DE screening suggest there may be an abnormality, e.g., to help differentiate those with "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e>" from hypertrophic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac computed tomography can be added to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in select cases when an abnormality is suggested during SCA screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Test availability, cost, and ethical issues related to who to screen, as well as the detection of those with potential disease but low risk, must be balanced when deciding what tests to perform to assess for increased SCA risk </plain></SENT>
