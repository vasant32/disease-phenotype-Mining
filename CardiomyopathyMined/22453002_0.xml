<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 51 patients (62Â±13 years, 29 women) who had suspected SCMP in the ED with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and showed apical wall motion abnormality on 2-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assessed by real-time MCE and the perfusion status and quantitative myocardial perfusion parameters were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After MCE, coronary angiography was performed within 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 51 patients, 27 had significant perfusion defects (group A) and 24 had preserved perfusion at the apex (group B) by MCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group A, 25 patients showed significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 2 patients showed no critical <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group B, 20 patients showed no <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis and 4 patients showed moderate LAD stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of MCE for detection of SCMP were 91%, 86.2%, 83%, and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative MCE parameters were significantly decreased in group A compared with group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial perfusion measured by MCE is relatively preserved in patients with SCMP compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, real-time MCE may be a useful noninvasive diagnostic tool to distinguish SCMP from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> in the ED </plain></SENT>
