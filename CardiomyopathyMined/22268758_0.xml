<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In trying to understand the causes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, it is difficult to study polygenic interactions that contribute to the severity of the disease, which is in part due to genetic complexity and generation time of higher organisms that hinder efficient screening for modifiers of primary causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adult Drosophila heart has recently been established as a model to probe genetic interactions that lead to cardiac dysfunction in this genetically simple and short-lived organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has made it possible to systematically and efficiently screen for polygenic modulators of heart dysfunction inflicted by known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As heart development and fundamental aspects of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> show remarkable evolutionary conservation, it has become possible to uncover new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> candidates by using Drosophila genetic tools in combination with sensitive heart function assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the discovery of several new genes, genetic pathways, and interactions that will help understand human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, interactions between cardiogenic transcription factors, discovered in Drosophila, are also critical for adult heart function in flies and mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include interactions between tinman/Nkx2-5 and neuromancer/Tbx20, which led to the discovery of possibly disease-causing familial variants in human TBX20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A new genetic pathway from tinman/Nkx2-5 to Cdc42, involving the microRNA miR-1, was recently discovered in flies and subsequently validated to function similarly in mouse heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the fly heart has proven to be a useful discovery tool for screening genetic interactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct </plain></SENT>
