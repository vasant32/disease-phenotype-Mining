<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Application of immunoapheresis to eliminate pathogenic autoantibodies targeting the second extracellular loop of the β1-receptor (β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>) is currently investigated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aptamers (single short DNA or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> strands) are a new class of molecules that bind to a specific target molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This property qualifies aptamers for potential use in the apheresis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently identified an aptamer that specifically binds to β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>, so in the present study we tested whether this aptamer could be used as a binder to prepare an apheresis column suitable for clearing β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> from rat's blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: An apheresis column was designed containing the β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-targeting-aptamer coupled to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As tested in vitro, this column (1) binds β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> highly specifically without marked interference with common IgGs, (2) has a capacity for clearing of approximately 1L of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive serum and (3) can be completely regenerated for subsequent use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the column for extracorporeal apheresis of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) positive for both β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> and muscarinic 2-receptor autoantibodies (M2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>), only β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up of 9 weeks, recurrence of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> in the blood of SHR could not be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: For the first time, a newly designed apheresis column with a β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> specific aptamer as a binder was successfully used to eliminate β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> from SHR blood.  (Circ J 2012; 76: 2449-2455) </plain></SENT>
