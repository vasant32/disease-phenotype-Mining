<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Risk stratification strategies employing sarcomere gene mutational analysis have proved imprecise in identifying high-risk patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional genetic risk markers that reliably determine which patients are predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether multiple disease-causing sarcomere mutations can be regarded as markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the absence of other conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Databases of 3 HCM centers were accessed, and 18 probands with 2 disease-causing mutations in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe disease progression or adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 7 of these 18 patients (39%), including 3 patients (ages 31, 37, and 57 years) who experienced sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> but also were without evidence of conventional HCM risk factors; 2 survived with timely defibrillation and therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 3 probands carried distinct and heterozygous disease-causing sarcomere mutations (including a man who inherited 1 mutation independently from each of his parents with HCM)-that is, double MYBPC3 and TNNI3 mutations and compound MYBPC3 mutations-as the only predisposing clinical markers evident to potentially explain their unexpected cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations support the emerging hypothesis that double (or compound) mutations detected by genetic testing may confer a gene dosage effect in HCM, thereby predisposing patients to adverse disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 families, multiple sarcomere mutations were associated with a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, even in the absence of conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
