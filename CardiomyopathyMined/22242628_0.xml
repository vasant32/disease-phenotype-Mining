<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a two-center experience of pediatric patients with FVP and an unexpectedly high association of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> (CHDs), chromosomal anomalies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of the electrophysiology database at two institutions was performed to identify patients with FVP from January 2000 to January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of these patients were reviewed for clinical history and course, presence of comorbidities, and details of intracardiac electrophysiology (EP) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary indication for EP study was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> pattern on electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients, 12/17 (71%), were found to have associated cardiac and genetic anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was found in 5/17 (29%) patients, with genetic testing in two patients demonstrating the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 mutation (Danon syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Underlying complex CHDs were present in 3/17 (18%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient (6%) was status post (s/p) cardiac transplant, one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and another had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other electrophysiologic substrates mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were found in 3/17 (18%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 5/17 patients (29%) were otherwise healthy with structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this largest reported series of FVP in children, there is an unusually high association of FVP with complex CHDs, chromosomal anomalies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Any patient with such disorders and manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion for a FVP </plain></SENT>
