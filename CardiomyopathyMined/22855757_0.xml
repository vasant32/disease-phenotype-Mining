<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 228 sera from Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> patients classified into four clinical groups and 108 from non-chagasic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa index measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As previously described, the highest values of diagnostic parameters were achieved for T. cruzi lysate and JL7; <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> P013 showed high specificity but low sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> resulted in lower sensitivity and specificity in our ELISA than T. cruzi lysate and JL7 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against JL7 protein were mainly detected in sera from patients with severe chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, compared with those from the indeterminate form, whereas <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> failed to discriminate between the clinical forms of the disease </plain></SENT>
