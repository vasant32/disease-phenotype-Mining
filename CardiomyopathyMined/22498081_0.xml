<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the outcomes of patients bridged to recovery compared with those bridged to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> left ventricular assist devices were implanted as a bridge to transplantation with a very proactive program of promoting myocardial recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 patients were bridged to recovery and 52 to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the bridged to recovery (explanted) group, 33 were men (age, 32.8 ± 11.8 years), 37 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (familial in 3, peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 3) and 3 had <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the bridged to transplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42.3 ± 12.5 years; P &lt; .0005 vs bridged to recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> in 24, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 2, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> in 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CHF|chf">congestive heart disease</z:e> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The survival rate was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3, and 78.3% in the explanted and transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 12 (23%) patients bridged transplantation either died from, or required ventricular assist device support, for primary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the explanted patients, 4 (10%) subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and 1213 days (2 died 25 and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after 1523 and 3199 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-free survival less noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for the bridged to recovery and bridged to transplantation groups, respectively, was 89.9%, 73.9%, and 73.9% and 80.4%, 78.3%, and 78.3% at 1, 3, and 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At latest follow-up (1394 ± 1195 days for the bridged to recovery and 1913 ± 941 days for the bridged to transplantation group), 5 of the bridged to transplantation patients (9.6%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, 34 (65.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, 25 (48.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 7 (13.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was 125.5 ± 43.5 vs 95.2 ± 16.5 μmol/L for the bridged to transplantation and bridged to recovery groups (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery is comparable, if not better than, after bridge to transplantation </plain></SENT>
