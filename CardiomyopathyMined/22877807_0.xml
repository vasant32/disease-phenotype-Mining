<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who have in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine in-hospital mortality rate, complication rate, and characteristics of patients with in-hospital mortality related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the National Inpatient Database Samples 2008 to 2009 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 42983 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, we assessed demographic factors, the prevalence and associated mortality of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illnesses</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and noncardiac surgery), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, cardiogenic shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and intraaortic balloon pump placement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 24,701 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality rate was 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 21,994 patients (89.0%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male patients had a higher mortality rate than females (8.4% vs 3.6%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age and race were not associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of patients with in-hospital mortality, 81.4% had underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illnesses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Male patients with takotsubo had higher incidence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illnesses</z:e> than their female counterparts (36.6% vs 26.8%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e> was the main driver of mortality, as these patients comprised &gt;80% of patients with in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Male patients, who were significantly more likely to have underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e>, had significantly higher mortality rates than female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The presence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e> likely explains the higher mortality rate among male patients </plain></SENT>
