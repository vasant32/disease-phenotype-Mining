<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of ADIPOQ variants, total and high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW) adiponectin levels with the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) diagnosed by coronary angiography in Brazilian subjects with high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 603 subjects undergoing coronary angiography were studied in regard to their glycemic status and presence of CAD (lesions &gt;0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated baseline concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin and three ADIPOQ variants: -11391G&gt;A (rs17300539), +45T&gt;G (rs2241766) and+276G&gt;T (rs1501299) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The G-allele of rs2241766 was associated with higher levels of total and HMW adiponectin, and the A-allele of rs17300539 was associated with higher levels of HMW adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of total and HMW adiponectin were independently associated with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G-allele of rs2241766 (OR 2.45, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1.05-6.04, p=0.04) and the G-allele of rs1501299 (OR 1.89, 95% C.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1.04-3.45, p=0.03) were associated with CAD, and these associations were independent of circulating levels of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Brazilian subjects with high cardiovascular risk, CAD was associated with lower total and HMW adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rs2241766 and rs1501299 polymorphisms were associated with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rs2241766 variant was associated with total and HMW adiponectin levels, while rs17300539 was associated with HMW adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
