<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported abnormal activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling in hearts from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice, which develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore determined whether an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling that has been investigated in clinical trials for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> has the potential to be translated to humans with LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the relevance of this finding in mice to patients, we analysed the ERK1/2 signalling in heart tissue from human subjects with LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and showed that it was abnormally activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway could potentially be used to treat LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, we administered selumetinib to male Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice starting at 16 weeks of age, after they show signs of cardiac deterioration, up to 20 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selumetinib is an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling and has been given safely to human subjects in clinical trials for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic treatment with selumetinib inhibited cardiac ERK1/2 phosphorylation and blocked increased expression of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> encoding natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere architecture that occurred in placebo-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and histological analysis demonstrated that treatment increases cardiac fractional shortening, prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, and prolongs survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selumetinib treatment did not induce biochemical abnormalities suggestive of renal or hepatic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that selumetinib or other related inhibitors that have been safely administered to humans in clinical trials could potentially be used to treat LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
