<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Myocardial scar is an adverse factor when considering which patients are likely to respond to cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be associated with a poor outcome from CRT, which may relate to the inability to place the right ventricular (RV) lead in the septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients (ejection fractions, 25 ± 8%; 45 men, 62.8 ± 14 years; 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; and 24 ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM)) receiving CRT underwent delayed enhancement cardiac MRI to assess location and burden of myocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response (AHR) was evaluated at implant with a pressure wire in the left ventricular (LV) cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV remodelling was determined by reduction in LV end-systolic volume at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of ICM with septal scar was associated with a poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was predominantly due to a worse response in patients with septal scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without septal scar had a better AHR with a 26.7 ± 28.9% rise in LV dP/dt (max) from baseline vs. -2.8 ± 14.5% for patients with septal scar (P = 0.01) with Biventricular (BIV) pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion remodelled (56% vs. 20% (P = 0.02)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only 33% of patients with septal scar had an RV septal lead compared with 66% with no septal scar (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of septal scar was associated with a poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may relate to the inability to achieve a RV septal lead placement </plain></SENT>
