<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the severity of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and myocardial remodelling in aged <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Body weight, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb(A1c)) levels, and urinary albumin excretion were monitored regularly in ZDF rats (n = 19) and control littermates (n = 19) up to age 45 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ZDF rats were severely diabetic during the entire study period and demonstrated decreased body and heart weights at sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) function was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at age 44 weeks and revealed similar LV ejection fraction and cardiac output index in control and ZDF rats, indicating preserved systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV pressure characteristics assessed at age 45 weeks showed significant, but mild elevations of LV end-diastolic pressure (+45%) and relaxation time constant Tau (+54%) in ZDF rats, indicating diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological analyses revealed a significantly increased LV collagen content (+50%), but no cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study clearly shows that long term, severe DM in 45-week-old ZDF rats resulted in relatively mild impairment of diastolic LV function, whereas systolic function was well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data do not support the notion that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> per se is a critical factor in the induction of a clinically relevant degree of cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-morbidities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> probably have larger impacts on myocardial function in diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
