<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effectiveness of a screening based on ECG and NT-proBNP in first-degree relatives of patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 106 first-degree relatives were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were evaluated by echocardiography, ECG, NT-proBNP, and molecular screening (available for 65 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the 106 individuals, 36 (34%) had diagnosis confirmed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using echocardiography as the gold standard, ECG criteria had a sensitivity of 0.71, 0.42, and 0.52 for the Romhilt-Estes, Sokolow-Lyon, and Cornell criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean values of NT-ProBNP were higher in affected as compared with nonaffected relatives (26.1 vs. 1290.5, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AUC of NT-proBNP was 0.98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff value of 70 pg/mL, we observed a sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using molecular genetics as the gold standard, ECG criteria had a sensitivity of 0.67, 0.37, and 0.42 for the Romhilt-Estes, Sokolow-Lyon, and Cornell criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff value of 70 pg/mL, we observed a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Values of NT-proBNP above 70 pg/mL can be used to effectively select high-risk first-degreeÂ relatives for HCM screening </plain></SENT>
