<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Despite increased understanding of the fundamental biology regulating cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, it has been challenging to find novel chemical or genetic modifiers of these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional cell-based methods do not model the complexity of an intact cardiovascular system and mammalian models are not readily adaptable to chemical or genetic screens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to create an in vivo model suitable for chemical and genetic screens for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the developing zebrafish, we established that the cardiac natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> genes (nppa and nppb), known markers of cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, were induced in the embryonic heart by pathological cardiac stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This pathological induction was distinct from the developmental regulation of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We created a luciferase-based transgenic reporter line that accurately modelled the pathological induction patterns of the zebrafish nppb gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Utilizing this reporter line, we were able to show remarkable conservation of pharmacological responses between the larval zebrafish heart and adult mammalian models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By performing a focused screen of chemical agents, we were able to show a distinct response of a genetic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin A</z:chebi>, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor, U0126 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe this in vivo reporter line will offer a unique approach to the identification of novel chemical or genetic regulators of <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
