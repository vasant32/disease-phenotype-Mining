<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac dysfunction is a primary cause of patient mortality in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, potentially related to elevated cytosolic calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the regional versus global functional consequences of cellular calcium mishandling have not been defined in the whole heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we sought for the first time to elucidate potential regional dependencies between calcium mishandling and myocardial fiber/sheet function as a manifestation of dystrophin-deficient (mdx) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated-perfused hearts from 16-mo-old mdx (N = 10) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT; N = 10) were arrested sequentially in diastole and systole for diffusion tensor MRI quantification of myocardial sheet architecture and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with WT hearts, mdx hearts exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic sheet architecture but a lower diastolic sheet angle magnitude (|Î²|) in the basal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regional diastolic sheet dysfunction was normalized by reducing perfusate calcium concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping of calcium transients in isolated hearts (3 mdx and 4 WT) revealed a stretch-inducible regional defect of intracellular calcium reuptake, reflected by a 25% increase of decay times (T(50)) and decay constants, at the base of mdx hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The basal region of mdx hearts also exhibited greater <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> than did the apex, which matched the regional sheet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that myocardial diastolic sheet dysfunction is observed initially in basal segments along with calcium mishandling, ultimately culminating in increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preservation of relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> calcium reuptake and diastolic/systolic sheet mechanics throughout the rest of the heart, together with the rapid reversibility of functional defects by reducing cytosolic calcium, points to the significance of regional mechanical factors in the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
