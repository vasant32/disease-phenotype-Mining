<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although clinical trials evaluating therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) have had clear limitations, there are few interventions in which multiple trial settings over a long period have consistently produced a 20% to 30% reduction in total mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substantial differences between the Guidelines on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation have resulted and the number of patients actually implanted following these recommendations remains relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As well as this, different reasons have been proposed to explain why randomized trials of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> versus control subjects implanted early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> do not show survival benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many factors in addition to ejection fraction (EF) do influence the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there are few tools to use this information to guide clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent years have seen an ongoing debate on the further risk stratification of patients who will benefit most from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and a combination of a few readily available clinical variables indicating advanced disease and comorbid conditions identifies <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the role of these devices in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, in older patients and females, for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD), has long been debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review aims to summarize these criticisms and to refine the current indications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in patients with moderate-severe left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
