<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report five cases of stress related cardiomyopahies that occurred in post-menopausal women (age range from 49 to 90) consecutively admitted to our Department in the last year in different clinical settings: typical anginal pain, carotid endarterectomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, cardiogenic shock, and severe asthenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apical left ventricular involvement was observed in three patients in conjunction with ECG mild ST segment elevation in anterior precordial leads resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>; isolated mid ventricular dysfunction was present in two patients in conjunction with ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the anterior precordial leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ECG evolved showing T wave inversion in four cases and normalized in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, blood chemistry showed mild elevation of CK-MB and TN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed wall motion abnormalities were reversible in four of five cases during hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stress echocardiography was performed in two patients (dobutamine in the patient with persistent mid-ventricular hypokinesis, exercise in another case) and correctly predicted the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that wall motion analysis at echocardiography combined with ECG ST segment changes and serum markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> (CK-MB and TN) may allow recognition of stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> in different clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echo stress may be proposed in those patients in whom some suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> persists </plain></SENT>
