<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the right and left ventricular thickness in deceased individuals with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> submitted to clinical autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 90 cases from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Verification Service of the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, Brazil, of both sexes, with a history of essential arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> related to heart wall thickness, in addition to correlation with autopsy findings and other clinical reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant association between the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (RVH) and between severe hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and RVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a predominance of RVH and LVH in men aged 60-79 years and a higher prevalence in the Brazilian mulatto and Black ethnic groups and in those with adequate nutritional status or overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was observed that the presence of RVH was related to LVH, suggesting that there are similar pathogenic factors involved in the development of bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RVH seems to be associated with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and may, based on other studies, be considered as a new prognostic factor in the evaluation of hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
