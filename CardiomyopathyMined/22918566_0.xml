<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have identified inflammatory components engaged in the transition from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and there is growing evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> are closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Novel technological advances in genomic screening have gained insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms involved the pathogenesis of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and, in particular, in the development of systolic dysfunction resulting from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detection of differential gene expression profiles have become valid tools in the study of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular signatures are defined as individual sets of genes, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts, proteins, genetic variations or other variables, which can be used as markers for a particular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These signatures may be useful for clinical diagnosis or risk assessment and, in addition, may help to identify molecules not previously known to be involved in the pathogenesis of these disease conditions.Microarray analyses have dramatically refined our knowledge about tissue-specific gene expression patterns, simply by being able to study thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the field of cardiovascular research, microarrays are increasingly used in the study of end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, such as <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, that ultimately lead to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By means of microarray analysis, a set of differentially expressed genes can be detected, among them are transcripts coding for sarcomeric and extracellular matrix proteins, stress response and inflammatory proteins as well as transcription factors and translational regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling may be particularly helpful to improve the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and enable novel insight into selected molecular pathways </plain></SENT>
