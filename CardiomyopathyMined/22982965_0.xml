<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the feasibility and safety of temporary percutaneous left ventricular (LV) stimulation as rescue therapy in patients with CS refractory to standard clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with deteriorating CS without further treatment options received transjugular placement of a temporary LV lead if they exhibited signs of asynchronous LV contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To maintain atrioventricular synchronous contraction an additional right atrial lead was placed in patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The leads were externally connected to a conventional pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic course, clinical outcome and adverse events were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 patients [ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n=6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (n=1)] underwent successful lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median procedure and fluoroscopy times measured 60min (interquartile range 55;90) and 12min (IQR 7;34), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (67%) acutely responded by improvement of hemodynamic parameters with simultaneous reduction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamine</z:chebi> therapy was discontinued after a median of 28hours (IQR 16;60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The temporary leads were removed after a median of 6 days (IQR 3;10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total in-hospital mortality was 47%, measuring 80% in non-responders and 30% in responders (p=0.119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no therapy related serious adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that there may be a role for temporary LV stimulation as rescue therapy in selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In clinical situations where aggressive therapies are used for urgent hemodynamic stabilization, temporary LV stimulation may evolve as a further and less invasive treatment option </plain></SENT>
