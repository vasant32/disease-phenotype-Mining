<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most cases of apparently idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) in children are caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCM also commonly occurs as an associated feature in some patients with disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although diagnosis of these disorders is based on typical phenotypic features, the dysmorphic manifestations can be subtle and therefore overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-MAPK genes in preadolescent children with idiopathic HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with apparently nonsyndromic HCM aged â‰¤13 years underwent clinical and genetic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire protein coding sequence of 9 genes implicated in Noonan syndrome and related conditions (PTPN11, SOS1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2), together with CBL (exons 8 and 9) and SHOC2 (4A&gt;G), were screened for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five probands (6.4%) carried novel sequence variants in SOS1 (2 individuals), BRAF, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structural and molecular data suggest that these variants may have functional significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine cardiac sarcomere protein genes were screened also; 2 individuals also had mutations in MYBPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reports novel and potentially pathogenic sequence variants in genes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-MAPK pathway, suggesting that genetic lesions promoting signaling dysregulation through <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> contribute to disease pathogenesis or progression in children with HCM </plain></SENT>
