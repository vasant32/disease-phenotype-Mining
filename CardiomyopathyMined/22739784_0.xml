<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation significantly decreases myocyte size and reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were to evaluate LV functional recovery after LVAD implantation and to assess its predictive factors, including histological findings of LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> underwent LVAD support with an EVAHEART implantable centrifugal pump (Sun Medical Technology Research, Nagano, Japan) for an average support duration of 2.91 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic samples were obtained from their LV apexes at the time of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 month and at 24 months after implantation, brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> values, LV end-diastolic dimension, LV end-systolic dimension, functional shortening, and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) were improved after LVAD implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with developing <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> had longer durations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart-failure</z:hpo> history and higher pulmonary artery pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypertrophic myocytes had smaller FS preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and the rate of BNP value change after LVAD implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with less <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and smaller myocytes preoperatively, improvement in LV function was observed during LVAD support </plain></SENT>
