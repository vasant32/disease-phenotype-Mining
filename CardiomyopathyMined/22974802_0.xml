<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform direct quantification of myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECF) with T1-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients suspected to have infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> refers to accumulation of abnormal substances within the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qualitative assessment of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) remains the most commonly used method for CMR evaluation of patients suspected with myocardial infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique is widely available and can be performed in a reproducible and standardized manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of extracellular matrix expansion due to myocardial infiltration in the intercellular space has, to date, not been amenable to noninvasive quantification with LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed 3-T CMR in 38 patients (mean age 68 Â± 15 years) who were referred for assessment of infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and also in 9 healthy volunteers as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The T1 quantification by Look-Locker gradient-echo before and after contrast determined segmental myocardial partition coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ECF was obtained by referencing the tissue partition coefficient for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> to the plasma volume fraction in blood, derived from serum hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cine CMR and LGE imaging in matching locations were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (45%) had cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (CA) (biopsy-confirmed or clinically highly probable), 20 (53%) had a non-amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085078" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lysosomal storage disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median global ECF was substantially higher in CA patients (0.49) compared with non-amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients (0.33, p &lt; 0.0001) and volunteers (0.24, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ECF strongly correlated with visually assessed segmental LGE (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001) and LV mass index (r = 0.69, p &lt; 0.0001), reflecting severity of myocardial infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with CA, ECF was highest in segments with LGE, although it remained elevated in segments without qualitative LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CMR ECF quantification identified substantial expansion of the interstitial space in patients with CA compared with volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies using this technique for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of myocardial infiltration are warranted </plain></SENT>
