<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to establish absolute ranges for right ventricular (RV) structural and functional parameters for endurance athletes and to establish any impact of body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data may help differentiate physiologic conditioning from arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective observational study design was used, and standard two-dimensional echocardiography was performed on 102 endurance athletes, providing RV structural indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two-dimensional strain (ε) technique was used to provide indices of RV ε and strain rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of RV chamber size to body surface area (BSA) and functional indices was examined by simple ratio scaling as well as adoption of the general, nonlinear allometric model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The values for RV inflow, outflow, length, and diastolic area were greater than published "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges" in 57%, 40%, 69%, and 59% of the population, respectively, while 28% of the population had RV outflow tract values greater than the proposed "major criteria" for arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple ratio scaling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RV dimensions to BSA did not produce size independence, whereas scaling for BSA allometrically did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strain and strain rate values were consistent with published <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, and there is no evidence to suggest that scaling is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RV chamber dimensions are larger in endurance athletes than those described by "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges" and frequently meet the major criteria for the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional assessment of RV ε may aid in this differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RV size is allometrically related to BSA and therefore scaling for population-specific b exponents is encouraged </plain></SENT>
