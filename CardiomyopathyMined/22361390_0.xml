<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In developed countries, sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) represents the most prevalent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in children between 1 month and 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> is a diagnosis of exclusion, a negative autopsy which requires the absence of structural organ disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although investigators have confirmed that a significant percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> cases are actually <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e>, no data have been made available as to whether other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>-associated diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), could be responsible for some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of a genetic mutation in the sarcomeric protein usually affects the force of contraction of the myocyte, whose <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is compensated with progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether in the most incipient forms, that is, first years of life, the lack of these phenotypes still confers a risk of arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main goal of the present study is to wonder whether genetic defects in the sarcomeric proteins, previously associated with HCM, could be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have analysed 286 SIDS cases for the most common genes implicated in HCM in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 680 mutations localised in 16 genes were analysed by semi-automated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) using the Sequenom MassARRAY(Â®) System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten subjects with completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts showed mutated alleles at nine of the genetic variants analysed, and one additional novel mutation was detected by conventional sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a genetic mutation associated with HCM may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in the absence of an identifiable phenotype </plain></SENT>
