<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since mitochondria are the principal source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), these organelles may play an important role in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (IC) development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome may influence this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test the relationship between IC development and the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) defining the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> haplogroups in a population study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten major European haplogroups were identified by using the single base extension technique and by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequencies and Odds Ratios for the association between IC patients (n = 358) and healthy controls (n = 423) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No convincing associations between classical risk factors for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> development and haplogroups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, compared to healthy controls, the prevalence of haplogroup H was significantly higher in IC patients (40.0% vs 50.0%, p-value  = 0.039) while the frequency of haplogroup J was significantly lower (11.1% vs 5.6%, p-value  = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the SNPs characterizing the European mtDNA haplogroups showed that the m.7028C allele (40.0% vs 50.0%, p-value  = 0.005) and m.14766C allele (43.0% vs 54.2%, p-value  = 0.002) were overrepresented in IC patients, meanwhile the m.10398G allele (19.8% vs 13.1%, p-value  = 0.015) and m.4216C allele (22.2% vs 16.5%, p-value  = 0.044) were found as protective factors against IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results showed that the haplogroups H and J were found as a risk and protective factors for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> development, respectively </plain></SENT>
