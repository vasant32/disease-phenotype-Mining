<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a 14-year-old boy with an 8.97â€‰Mb deletion of 2p23.3-24.3 detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> (ID), unusual facial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003756'>skeletal myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical features of the present case to previously described patients with an interstitial deletion within this chromosomal region and conclude that our patient exhibits a markedly different phenotype </plain></SENT>
