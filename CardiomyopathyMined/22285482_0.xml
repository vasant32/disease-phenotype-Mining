<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) in vivo function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, cytoskeletal proteins expression and distribution, Ca(2+) handling and contractile function of isolated cardiomyocytes were evaluated at the stages of the early, compensated, and late, decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 4-, 12- and 14-month-old Tgαq*44 mice, respectively, and compared to age-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FVB mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 4-month-old Tgαq*44 mice significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, moderate myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and increased expression of regularly arranged and homogenously distributed desmin accompanied by increased phosphorylation of desmin chaperone protein, αB-crystallin, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte shortening, Ca(2+) handling and LV function were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12 and 14 months of age, Tgαq*44 mice displayed progressive deterioration of the LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contractile performance of isolated myocytes was still preserved, and the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients was even increased probably due to impairment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger function, while <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was more extensive than in younger mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, substantial disarrangement of desmin distribution accompanied by decreasing phosphorylation of αB-crystallin appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Tgαq*44 mice disarrangement of desmin, at least partly related to inadequate phosphorylation of αB-crystallin seems to be importantly involved in the progressive deterioration of contractile heart function </plain></SENT>
