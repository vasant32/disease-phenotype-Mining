<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is characterized by extracellular matrix alteration and microcirculation impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These conditions might provide electrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, which is a substrate for arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1 mapping has been proposed to quantify diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> but has several limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2 measurement may represent an alternative for <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> quantification at high magnetic field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A magnetic resonance imaging protocol including in vivo T2 measurements at 11.75 T was performed in 9 male C57BL/6J mice after 8 weeks of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and in 9 control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2 measurements were compared with histologic quantification of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> using picrosirius red staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Myocardial T2 was significantly lower in diabetic mice (13.8 ± 2.8 ms) than in controls (18.9 ± 2.3 ms, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between T2 and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> area obtained by histopathology (R = 0.947, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During programmed ventricular stimulation, 3 nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> were induced in diabetic mice versus none in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo T2 relaxation time strongly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> area assessed with histologic staining in diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
