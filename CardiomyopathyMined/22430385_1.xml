<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these children develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, both genetic and acquired forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are a significant source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> occurs when the myocardium is unable to meet the body's metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike some organs, the heart has limited, if any, capacity for repair after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart transplantation remains the ultimate approach to treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, but this is costly and excludes patients who are poor candidates for transplantation given their comorbidities, or for whom a donor organ is unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stem cell therapy represents the first realistic strategy for reversing the effects of what has until now been considered terminal heart damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We will discuss potential sources of cardiac-specific stem cells, including mesenchymal, resident cardiac, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will consider efforts to enhance cardiac stem cell engraftment and survival in damaged myocardium, the incorporation of cardiac stem cells into tissue patches, and techniques for creating bioartificial myocardial tissue as well as whole organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we will review progress being made in assessing functional improvement in animals and humans after cellular transplant </plain></SENT>
