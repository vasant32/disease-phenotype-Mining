<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult human thymus degenerates into fat tissue (thymus adipose tissue (TAT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we described that TAT from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> ischemic subjects has angiogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to analyze whether aging could also impair angiogenic properties in TAT as in other adipose tissue such as subcutaneous (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAT and TAT specimens were obtained from 35 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, making these tissues readily available as a prime source of adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were separated into two age-dependent groups; middle-aged (n = 18) and elderly (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic, endothelial, and adipogenic expression markers were analyzed in both tissues from each group and correlations were examined between these parameters and also with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in subjects from either group in clinical or biological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic markers VEGF-A, B, C, and D and adipogenic parameters, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγ2), FABP4, and ADRP showed elevated expression levels in TAT from elderly patients compared to the middle-aged group, while in SAT, expression levels of these isoforms were significantly decreased in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, Thy1, CD31, CD29, and VLA1 showed increased levels in TAT from the elderly compared to the middle-aged, while in SAT these levels displayed a decline with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, in TAT, angiogenic and endothelial parameters exhibited strong positive correlations with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TAT appears to be the most appropriate source of angiogenic and endothelial factors in elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> subjects compared to SAT </plain></SENT>
