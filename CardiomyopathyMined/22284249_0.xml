<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) has been shown up-regulated in stress conditions and to have regulatory actions in myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that GDF-15 could be related to disease severity and functional status in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a study which includes 102 consecutive outpatient HCM subjects, 73% males, aged 47.1±14.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete history and clinical examination was performed, including 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiography, symptom-limited treadmill exercise, 24-hour ECG-Holter monitoring, and magnetic resonance with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several biomarkers, associated with myocardial remodeling and damage, were compared to GDF-15 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assays were performed with commercial ELISAs or standardized methods when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between GDF-15 levels and comorbidities, being higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p=0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.030), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (p=0.012), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (p=0.020) and NYHA≥II functional class (p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GDF-15 levels were positively correlated with clinical variables (age, worse exercise capacity and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>) and biomarkers of interstitial remodeling, such as metalloproteinase-2 (r: 0.40; p=0.009), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (r: 0.28; p=0.049), high-sensitivity troponin T (r: 0.30; p=0.003) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (r: 0.33; p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was assessed to estimate the involvement of these different factors in the GDF-15 levels, confirming the independent implication of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that higher levels of GDF-15 are associated to conditions of severe disease in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, GDF-15 is suggested as a novel marker related to the severity and could represent a further useful tool in monitoring functional capacity of HCM patients </plain></SENT>
