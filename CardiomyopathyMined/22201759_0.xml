<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic ablation of NM II-B in mice results in both cellular and structural defects involving cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities include a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, double outlet of the right ventricle, myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of myocyte binucleation due to abnormalities in cytokinesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice die by embryonic day (E) 14.5 due to defects in heart development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional ablation of NM II-B in cardiac myocytes after E11.5 allows study of NM II-B function in adult myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BaMHC/BaMHC mice are born with enlarged cardiac myocytes, some of which are multinucleated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 6-10 months of age they develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of these mice develop a marked widening of the intercalated discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The loss of NM II-B from the intercalated discs primarily affects the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> junctions rather than the gap junctions and desmosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the loss of NM II-B results in a decrease in the actin binding protein mXin which also has been shown to cause disruption of the intercalated disc in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (Gustafson-Wagner et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally we review the evidence showing that ablation of NM II-C (which also localizes to the intercalated disc) in mouse hearts deficient in NM II-B expression results in destabilization of N-cadherin and beta-catenin in the intercalated disc </plain></SENT>
