<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Suspicion of a DCMA syndrome prompted sequencing of the human DNAJC19 gene.Results:Sequencing of the human DNAJC19 gene showed a homozygous single nucleotide (A) deletion in alanine 63 coding triplet in exon 6, which does not immediately cause amino acid change but leads 11 amino acids later to a stop codon and to premature termination of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This DNAJC19 protein is located in the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane and has been shown to function as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> chaperone.Conclusion:This is the first clinical report of DCMA syndrome, a human DNAJC19 deficiency, that is related to cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> diagnosed in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNAJC19 deficiency causes a relatively specific finding in urinary organic acid analysis (methylglutaconic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012072'>aciduria</z:hpo> type V), which together with the clinical features of the ensuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, allows for effective screening before undertaking molecular genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
