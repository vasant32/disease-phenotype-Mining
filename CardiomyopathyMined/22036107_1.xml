<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is often challenging due to phenotypic variation, reduced/age-related penetrance, and lack of a diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single report has suggested quantitative myocardial immunoanalysis for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin as a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed immunohistochemistry for plakoglobin and a control protein on myocardial biopsies with fibrofatty replacements from 50 consecutive, unrelated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical, genetic, and immunohistochemical data were evaluated by independent observers in a blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical and clinical diagnoses were compared and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed 37 samples (74%) with a reduced immunosignal for plakoglobin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC, 29 displayed a reduced plakoglobin signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis other than ARVC, 6 displayed a reduced signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients were excluded from further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 57%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 62% were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, immunohistochemical analysis for plakoglobin, applied as a diagnostic test for ARVC, seems associated with a relatively high sensitivity, but limited specificity, and although additional validation is required, we advocate caution in basing clinical decision-making on the proposed diagnostic test </plain></SENT>
