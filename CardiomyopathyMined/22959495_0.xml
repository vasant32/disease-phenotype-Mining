<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, cardiomyocytes in beating hearts are exposed to large mechanical stress during successive heart beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling are well established in mammalian heart cells, the putative contribution of mechanosensitive channels to Ca(2+) homeostasis, Ca(2+) signaling and force generation has been primarily investigated in relation to heart <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For instance, transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) are up-regulated in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> models and seem to play a vital role in pathological Ca(2+) overload to cardiomyocytes, thus aggravating the pathology of disease at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apart from that, the contribution of mechanosensitive channels (MsC) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beating heart to the downstream force activation cascade has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present an overview of the current literature and concepts of mechanosensitive channel involvement in failing hearts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and novel data showing a likely contribution of Ca(2+) influx via mechanosensitive channels in beating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiomyocytes during systolic shortening </plain></SENT>
