<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Assessment of plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Doppler markers of increased left ventricular (LV) filling pressure may be added to risk stratify patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed at investigating the value of plasma MMP-9 and restrictive filling pattern (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>) in IC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (LV ejection fraction≤40%) due to IC were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete M-mode and two-dimensional echo-Doppler examination were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were defined as having <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> if they had a mitral E wave deceleration time&lt;150ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma MMP-9 and N-terminal protype-B natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were assessed at the time of the index echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality or hospitalization for worsening HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up period was 25±17months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median value of MMP-9 was 714ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, a number of measurements predicted the composite end point: NYHA class&gt;2, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>, MMP-9&gt;60.5ng/ml, LV ejection fraction&lt;27%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, pulmonary pressure≥35mmHg, N-terminal protype-B natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>&gt;1742pg/ml, and glomerular filtration rate&lt;60ml/min/1.73m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent variables of outcome were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (HR=1.9, p=0.031), and the combination of plasma MMP-9 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> (HR=3.2, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On Kaplan-Meier survival curves, patients with elevated MMP-9 levels and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> had the lowest event-free survival rate (log-rank: 29.0, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The net reclassification improvement showed a significant increase in the prediction model when elevated MMP-9 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> were added to the base model that included clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMP-9 levels and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi> have an incremental predictive value to risk classify IC patients </plain></SENT>
