<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diminished ATP synthase results in low ATP production, elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and increased ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test whether the patient cells may react to metabolic disbalance by changes in oxidative phosphorylation system, we performed a quantitative analysis of respiratory chain complexes and intramitochondrial proteases involved in their turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>- and BN-PAGE Western blot analysis of fibroblasts from 10 patients with TMEM70 317-2A&gt;G homozygous mutation showed a significant 82-89% decrease of ATP synthase and 50-162% increase of respiratory chain complex IV and 22-53% increase of complex III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of Lon protease, paraplegin and prohibitins 1 and 2 was not significantly changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole genome expression profiling revealed a generalized upregulation of transcriptional activity, but did not show any consistent changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of structural subunits, specific assembly factors of respiratory chain complexes, or in regulatory genes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis which would parallel the protein data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA content in patient cells was also not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate involvement of posttranscriptional events in the adaptive regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis that allows for the compensatory increase of respiratory chain complexes III and IV in response to deficiency of ATP synthase </plain></SENT>
