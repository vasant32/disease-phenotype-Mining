<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular biopsy revealed extensive cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the elevated levels of serum ferritin, the patient had no history of multiple red blood cell transfusions; moreover, genetic testing for hereditary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> was negative for the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chelation therapy was considered for this patient, to reduce the cardiac iron deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, before a course of treatment was established, the patient's clinical condition worsened, and chelation therapy was no longer feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was referred for combined heart and liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> can be diagnosed readily using right ventricular biopsy or T2* magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early detection may allow time for intensive chelation therapy, which might, in turn, reverse the myopathic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved cardiac function should improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> patients' chances to be placed on the liver transplant waiting list and ultimately optimize transplantation outcomes </plain></SENT>
