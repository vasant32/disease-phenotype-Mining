<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine how <z:hpo ids='HP_0002189'>excessive daytime sleepiness</z:hpo> (EDS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> contribute to health-related quality of life (HRQL) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF were enrolled into a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from 280 subjects enrolled from three sites in the northeastern USA; 242 completed the 6-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, cohorts with and without EDS were identified using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each EDS group was further subdivided into those with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> using a battery of five neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two disease-specific measures, the Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), were used to measure HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>General linear modelling of square-transformed variables was used to test the hypothesis that cohort membership was a significant predictor of HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 months the remaining sample was 62.5 [standard deviation (SD) 12] years old, mostly male (63%), white (65%), and functionally compromised [72% New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cohort with both EDS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> had the lowest KCCQ overall summary score (60.5 ± 22.5) compared with the cohort without EDS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired cognition</z:e> (74.6 ± 17.4, P ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was seen on the FOSQ (16.0 ± 2.8 vs. 18.5 ± 2.2, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Impaired cognition</z:e> alone did not explain poor HRQL, but the addition of EDS poses a significant risk for poor HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions designed to influence EDS may improve HRQL in this population </plain></SENT>
