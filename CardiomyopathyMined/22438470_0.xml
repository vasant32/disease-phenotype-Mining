<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of eHsps in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (Dox)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine how Dox affects circulating eHsp25 in blood plasma and how eHsp25 affects Dox-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> mice [HSF-1(+/+)] were pretreated with 100 μl of heterozygous heat shock factor-1 [HSF-1(+/-)] mouse plasma (which contained 4-fold higher eHsp25 compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice), HSF-1(+/+) plasma, or saline, before treatment with Dox (6 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of this treatment protocol, HSF-1(+/-) plasma-pretreated mice showed increased eHsp25 in plasma and improved cardiac function (percentage of fractional shortening 37.3 ± 2.1 versus 26.4 ± 4.0) and better life span (31 ± 2 versus 22 ± 3 days) compared with the HSF-1(+/+) plasma or saline-pretreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of isolated adult cardiomyocytes with HSF-1(+/-) plasma or recombinant human Hsp27 (rhHsp27) significantly reduced Dox-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB and cytokine release and delayed cardiomyocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when cardiomyocytes were incubated with fluorescence-tagged rhHsp27, a saturation in binding was observed, suggesting that eHsp25 can bind to surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Competitive assays with a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antibody reduced the rhHSP27 binding, indicating that Hsp25 interacts with TLR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transfusion of Hsp25-enriched blood plasma protected the heart from Dox-induced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hsp25 antagonized Dox binding to the TLR2 receptor on cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
