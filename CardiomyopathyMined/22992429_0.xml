<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> leads to cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and an imbalance in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is characterised by <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">alpha-lipoic acid</z:chebi> (ALA) on cardiac energy metabolism, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the hearts of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Animals were separated into non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone OLETF rats with or without ALA (200 mg/kg/day) administration for 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was assessed by staining with Sirius Red </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of ALA on AMPK signalling, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>-related genes in the heart of OLETF rats were performed by Western blot analysis or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that cardiac <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) signalling was lower in OLETF rats than in LETO rats, and that ALA treatment increased the signalling in OLETF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the low <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity in OLETF rats was increased by ALA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to increased Sirius red staining of collagen deposits, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were expressed at higher levels in OLETF rat hearts than in LETO rat hearts, and the levels of these factors were decreased by ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ALA enhances AMPK signalling, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, and antifibrogenic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Theses findings suggest that ALA may have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
