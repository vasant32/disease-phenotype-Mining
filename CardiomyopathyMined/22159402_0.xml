<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It would be desirable to know predictors of mortality for patients with this condition in order to provide proper scientific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> secondary to SAH in the current era of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy for left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients routinely and prospectively followed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Clinic of our Institution from January, 2000 to April, 2008 with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> secondary to SAH were screened for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model was used to establish independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were included; 74 (57%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty one (24%) patients died, 5 (4%) underwent heart transplantation, and 94 (72%) were alive at study end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival probability at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months was 96%, 93%, 84%, 79%, and 76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age (Hazard Ratio=1,05, 95% Confidence Interval 95% 1,01 to 1,08, p value=0,01), left ventricular diastolic dimension (Hazard Ratio=1,08; 95% Confidence Interval 1,02 to 1,09; p value=0,003), and B-Blocker therapy (Hazard Ratio=0,41; 95% Confidence Interval 0,19 to 0,86; p value=0,02) were found to be independent predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age, left ventricular diastolic dimension and underuse of Beta-Blocker therapy were independent predictors of mortality for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> secondary to SAH in the population studied </plain></SENT>
