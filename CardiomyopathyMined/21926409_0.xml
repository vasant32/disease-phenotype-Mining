<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early detection of subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction following a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> may be a preventive strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> analysis using two-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging (STI), useful for detecting early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-mediated cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Conventional and Doppler echocardiography images were obtained from 25 patients (mean age 58 ± 11 years) before chemotherapy and 1 and 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> doses were 98 ± 59 and 170 ± 87 g/m(2) at 1 and 3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After standard echocardiography, LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> and twisting velocity profiles from apical and basal short-axis images were analysed using STI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV dimensions and ejection fraction did not change throughout follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although isovolumic relaxation time showed prolongation 3 months after chemotherapy, other Doppler indices did not show significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, significant deteriorations in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001 by ANOVA), twisting rate (P &lt; 0.0001 by ANOVA), and untwisting rate (P &lt; 0.001 by ANOVA) were found 1 month after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation was observed between cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> doses and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> (r = -0.524, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> analysis could be a useful non-invasive approach for early detection of subclinical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
