<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial strain is useful in the evaluation of left ventricular function using high-frame rate two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) STE allows 3D measurement of myocardial deformation, which is potentially more accurate, because it is not affected by through-plane motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the low frame rates of 3D STE are a potential limitation that has not been studied to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas with 2D STE, high frame rates are necessary because speckles may move out of the imaging plane, it was hypothesized that because they always remain within the scan volume, they should be tracked with 3D STE, even if frame rates are considerably lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven subjects were studied, including 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and 11 patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, who underwent 2D (frame rate, 62 Â± 9 frames/sec) and 3D echocardiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 3D imaging was performed at four different frame rates, achieved by varying the number of beats used for full-volume acquisition (six, four, two, and one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 3D imaging was performed using a four-beat acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The principal components of strain and the corresponding strain rates were calculated in 16 myocardial segments and averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both 2D and 3D images were analyzed using TomTec software to avoid analysis-related differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, strain and strain rate values were the same for 3D STE with six-beat and four-beat full-volume data sets, corresponding to 25 and 18 frames/sec, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 3D STE with one-beat and two-beat data sets, corresponding to 5 and 10 frames/sec, respectively, resulted in significantly lower values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strain and strain rate values derived from six-beat and four-beat 3D data sets were not significantly lower than 2D STE-derived values, indicating that there was no loss of information due to lower frame rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, both 2D STE-derived and 3D STE-derived strain values were significantly reduced compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The differences between 2D STE-derived and 3D STE-derived strain values echoed those noted in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic assessment of myocardial deformation is not compromised by low frame rates when derived from 18 or 25 frames/sec data sets but is underestimated with lower frame rates </plain></SENT>
