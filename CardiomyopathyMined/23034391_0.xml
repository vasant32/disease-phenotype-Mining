<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteomic alterations resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> have been reported though the mechanisms driving changes in proteomic signatures are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>miRNAs have been considered as potential regulators of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether miRNAs play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteomic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RTQ-PCR miRNA screening in diabetic mice, five weeks following multiple low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> treatment was associated with alteration in the expression of 29 miRNAs in the diabetic heart as compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those miRNAs upregulated in the diabetic heart was miR-141 (p&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>miRNA target predication analyses identified miR-141 as a potential regulator of the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane phosphate transporter, solute carrier family 25 member 3 (Slc25a3), which provides inorganic phosphate to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> matrix and is essential for ATP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a luciferase reporter construct with a Slc25a3 3'-UTR target sequence, overexpression of miR-141 down-regulated luciferase activity levels confirming miR-141/Slc25a3 3'-UTR binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>miR-141 overexpression in HEK 293 cells elicited a decrease in Slc25a3 protein content and a decrease in ATP synthase activity, similar to the diabetic phenotype (p&lt;0.05, for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) displayed decreased Slc25a3 protein content which was inversely correlated with increased miR-141 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, diabetic IFM ATP synthase activity was also decreased (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together these results indicate that miR-141 can regulate Slc25a3 protein expression in the diabetic heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced miRNA changes may influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteomes and functional processes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production </plain></SENT>
