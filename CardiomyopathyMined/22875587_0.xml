<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decision to suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> is largely based on the presence of symptoms, interference with other therapy (e.g., cardiac resynchronization therapy), or suspicion of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation has emerged as a safe and effective option for the treatment of frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Careful attention to <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> characteristics on surface electrocardiogram has proven useful for the initial localization of the ectopic focus, which may then serve as a guide to procedural planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The point of interest is often identified with activation mapping, and the ablation site can be further defined with pace mapping techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical experience with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> ablation has been successful in â‰¥80 % of cases, and the literature reports multiple cases of marked improvement in LV function after eradicating the culprit ectopic focus in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
