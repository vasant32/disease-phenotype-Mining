<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with pathologic LVH have often symptoms and signs suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under these circumstances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is due to coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities of the coronary microcirculation may be unrelated to the degree of LVH and cause a reduction in maximum myocardial blood flow which, in the absence of epicardial stenoses, is suggestive of CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no technique that enables direct visualization of coronary microcirculation in vivo in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its assessment relies on the measurement of parameters which reflect its functional status, such as myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve which is an integrated measure of flow through both the large epicardial coronary arteries and the microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review article we discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for CMD in patients with primary and secondary LVH and how the recognition of this phenomenon is providing new important information on patient stratification and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we discuss how assessment of CMD may be used as a valuable surrogate marker to test the efficacy of old and new drugs </plain></SENT>
