<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Recent retrospective studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> could be a predisposing risk factor for Tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to characterize the prevalence of anxiodepressive disorders (ADD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038443" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological stress</z:e> (CPS) in patients with TTC or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Between January 2010 and December 2011, 45 consecutive patients with TTC were prospectively screened by systematic interview with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CPS was systematically recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 50 patients admitted for ACS with troponin elevation and matched for age and sex were prospectively included as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stressful event within 72h before presentation was identified in 35 patients (78%) with TTC vs. 9 (18%) with ACS (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (78%) and 13 (26%) had ADD in the TTC and ACS groups, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPS was found in 20 patients (44%) and in 9 (18%) with TTC and ACS, respectively (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CPS and/or ADD were found in 35 patients (78%) and in 18 (36%) with TTC and ACS, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: ADD and CPS are common in patients with TTC and more frequent than in patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that systemic effects of ADD and CPS could participate in the pathophysiology of TTC </plain></SENT>
