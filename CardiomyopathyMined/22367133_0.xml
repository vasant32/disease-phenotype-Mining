<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome mainly occurs in postmenopausal women and has a temporary relationship with emotional or physical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: TTS occurred in 46-year-old female patient on the first day after renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant symptoms were connected with ACS, performed with low grade troponin elevation and characteristic shape of left ventricle depicted in echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration the risk of the development of contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, coronary angiography (CA) was delayed; myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (¹²³I-mIBG) myocardial uptake were performed to confirm the clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) performed in rest condition showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion but myocardial uptake of ¹²³I-mIBG was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 6 months after surgery, full recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biochemical and functional parameters of the left ventricle were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At that time CA was done, depicting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTS could be diagnosed by the use of non-nephrotoxic tests - ¹²³I-mIBG myocardial scintigraphy, MPS and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
