<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently, pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) &gt;6 WU × m(2) (indexed units) is generally considered a contraindication to isolated orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this has been questioned in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients &lt;18 years old who underwent primary OHT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected with regard to demographics, pre-operative hemodynamics, need for pre-operative mechanical circulatory support, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> reactivity and 30-day mortality (30dM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to establish an optimal threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the influence of PVRI on 30dM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete data were available for 158 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients &lt;18 years of age, who underwent primary OHT between June 1984 and November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve yielded a threshold of 9.290 indexed units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of 19 patients (21.1%) with PVRI &gt;9 died in the first 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with PVRI &lt;9, there was only 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among 139 patients (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds of mortality increased incrementally with PVRI as a continuous variable, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.35 per indexed unit (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PVRI was dichomotomized (PVRId) using the previously established threshold and revealed an increasing risk of mortality, OR 36.80 (95% confidence interval 3.86 to 350.90), with a PVRI of &gt;9 indexed units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a PVRI &gt;6 as a contraindication to isolated OHT may be too restrictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with PVRI ≤9 do not appear to be at increased risk of early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with PVRI &gt;9, 30-day survival was 78.9% in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This represents a viable alternative to heart-lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
