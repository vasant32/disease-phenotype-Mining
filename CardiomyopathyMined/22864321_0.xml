<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of interventional and electrophysiological methods is therefore the state of art technique for implantation of LV leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 52 year-old male patient with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVEF: 15%, QRS: 160 msec) who was symptomatic under optimal medical therapy was hospitalized for implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although right ventricular and atrial electrodes were implanted successfully, we had difficulty during placement of the left ventricular electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an anatomical variation in CS with a piped shape, which prevented cannulation from the superior approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe a practical method for guidance of transfemoral route for pipe-shaped CS cannulation and epicardial placement of LV lead with superior approach </plain></SENT>
