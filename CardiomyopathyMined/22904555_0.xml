<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background/Aims Family relationship data in the Scott &amp; White Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) gathered from multiple sources across the institution is a rich resource that provides an opportunity to study patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> and the ability to evaluate the efficacy of targeted screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an integrated healthcare delivery system, linkage of the parent and child (family) electronic health records (EHR) provides an opportunity to improve outcomes by implementing proactive/preventative screening and/ or treatment in offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study focuses on how linkage of the parent/ child EHR can be used to identifying youth at risk for a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods The comprehensive procedure developed at Scott &amp; White includes gathering relationship information from members at time of enrollment with the Scott &amp; White Health Plan (SWHP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationship codes provide the linkage between the family enrollment records and medical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationships are identified by insurance subscribers and covered dependents from SWHP data, and by guarantor and covered dependents from EHR data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This field is then matched against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes for a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> to generate a list of parent-child pairs that can be used to implement early focused screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results We were able to evaluate how often offspring were screened for a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> diseases including familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and long QT as well as a number of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major problem with this approach is that biological linkage cannot be established (i.e., adoption or step-parent, grandparent may be insured adult) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this approach provides an opportunity to create flags in the EHR for a first- pass screening that can be enhanced by extraction of additional information (i.e., biological linkage) obtained by a provider during a point-of-care service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discussion An integrated healthcare delivery system combined with a family-linkage field in the VDW provides an opportunity to improve outcomes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> through focused screening potentially involving the use of flags for the healthcare provider </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Implementation of early, targeted screenings may improve long-term health outcomes and potentially provide a cost-effective strategy for preventive healthcare </plain></SENT>
