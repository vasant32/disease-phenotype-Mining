<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical trials often rely on echocardiographic measures of left ventricular size and function as surrogate end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the quantitative impact of factors that affect the reproducibility of these measures is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded Pediatric Heart Network designed a longitudinal observational study of children with known or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> aged 0 to 22 years from eight pediatric clinical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data were collected together with 150 echocardiographic indices of left ventricular size and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate observers performed duplicate echocardiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple observers performed measurements from three cardiac cycles to enable assessment of intraobserver and interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impacts of beat averaging (BA), observer type (local vs core), and variable type (areas, calculations, dimensions, slopes, time intervals, and velocities) on measurement reproducibility were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was percentage error (100 Ã— difference/mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 173 enrolled subjects, 131 met criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BA, variable type and observer type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> influenced percentage error (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Core interobserver percentage error (medians, 11.4%, 10.2%, and 9.3% for BA using one, two, and three beats, respectively) was approximately twice the intraobserver percentage error (medians, 6.3%, 4.9%, and 4.2% for BA using one, two, and three beats, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Slopes and calculated variables exhibited high percentage error despite BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chamber dimensions, areas, velocities, and time intervals exhibited low percentage error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive evaluation of quantitative echocardiographic methods will provide a valuable resource for the design of future pediatric studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BA and a single core lab observer improve the reproducibility of echocardiographic measurements in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Certain measurements are highly reproducible, while others, despite BA, are poorly reproducible </plain></SENT>
