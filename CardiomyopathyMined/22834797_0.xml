<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet the expression and serum levels of chromogranins and natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> have been closely correlated with pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in distinction from the physiological <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> that appears not to involve <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>) production as the primary signaling step, accumulating evidence underscores the central role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-induced intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> releases in cardiomyocytes in the development of pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release inside the nucleus has been suggested to initiate a series of nuclear activities, including 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-calmodulin (CaM) mediated protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation, 2) activation of transcription factors such as myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and 3) increased production of chromogranins, natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and growth factors, which eventually lead to pathological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although secretory granules function as the major <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-sensitive intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> store and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release from secretory granules in cardiomyocytes contributes to secretion of chromogranins and natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, the direct cause of pathological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> appears to be due to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release from the small nucleoplasmic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> store vesicles, thereby initiating the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated nuclear activities that lead to formation of more secretory granules, pathologic enlargement of cardiomyocytes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
