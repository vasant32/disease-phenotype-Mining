<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive research in the field, the molecular mechanism responsible for the development of this slow progressing disease remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, mitochondria are damaged and <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> are elevated before the histopathology associated with the disease can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate a variety of cellular functions including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic environment stimulates the secretion of several MMPs that are considered to participate in complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and also animal models have shown increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 in their retina and vitreous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent research has shown that MMPs have dual role in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>; in the early stages of the disease (pre-neovascularization), MMP-2 and MMP-9 facilitate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary cells, possibly via damaging the mitochondria, and in the later phase, they help in neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the literature to evaluate the role of MMPs, especially MMP-9, in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and presents existing evidence that the inhibitors targeted toward MMP-9, depending on the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at the times their administration could have potential to prevent the progression of this blinding disease, and protect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Inhibitors of MMPs could have dual role: in the early stages of the diseases, inhibit capillary cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and if the disease has progressed to the angiogenic stage, inhibit the growth of new vessels </plain></SENT>
