<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microchimerism refers to acquisition of cells from another individual and can be due to bidirectional cell traffic between mother and fetus during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> associated with high mortality rates has the highest recovery rate amongst <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> although the reason is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these observations led us to hypothesize that fetal cells enter the maternal circulation and may be recruited to the sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> or injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability to genetically modify mice makes them an ideal system for studying the phenomenon of microchimerism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Described here is a mouse model for ischemic cardiac injury during pregnancy designed to study microchimerism </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the selective homing of eGFP cells to the site of cardiac injury without such homing to noninjured tissues suggesting the presence of precise signals sensed by fetal cells enabling them to target diseased myocardium specifically </plain></SENT>
