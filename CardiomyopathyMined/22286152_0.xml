<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been suggested that some heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp60 are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> including cardiospecific ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work we focused on the involvement of another well known heat shock protein, Hsp90, and its novel co-chaperone, Sgt1, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the level of autoantibodies against these two proteins was significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> than in sera of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also analyzed the expression level and subcellular localization of Hsp90 and Sgt1 in diseased myocardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Western blot we found changes in subcellular localization of Hsp90 in the left ventricle of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> hearts while the total level of this protein remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the Sgt1 protein, we found an increased level in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and no changes in subcellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp90 and Sgt1 might be involved in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and might serve as markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> of different origin </plain></SENT>
