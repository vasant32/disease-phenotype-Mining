<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedure successfully reduced the pressure gradient from 180 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg, and systolic anterior movement of the mitral leaflet disappeared </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative VVI revealed that interventricular septal myectomy/myotomy is useful, not only in reducing LVOT obstruction, but also in reducing hyper-contractility, which increases the distance from the mitral valve to the papillary muscle and relieves <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
