<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient did not meet the criteria for heart transplantation and declined left ventricular assist device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to conduct cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under general anaesthesia for CRT-D implantation, cardiac function worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to deteriorating haemodynamics, CRT-D implantation was aborted and emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implantation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent weaning from ECMO was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We decided to proceed with CRT-D implantation while still on ECMO support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With biventricular stimulation, cardiac function improved promptly and the patient could be weaned from ECMO the same day </plain></SENT>
