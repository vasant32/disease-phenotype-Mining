<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objectives- Ourstudy was undertaken to analyze the impact of subtle noncompaction of the left ventricle on regional left ventricular function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods- Speckle-tracking imaging and contrast echocardiography were performed in 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subtle noncompaction of the left ventricle was defined as myocardium with more than 3 trabeculations in a single imaging plane with a noncompaction to compaction ratio of greater than 0.4 and less than 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results- Among 647 segments, noncompaction was present in 46 segments (7%) in the left ventricular apex in 18 patients (45%) on the standard 2-dimensional echocardiograms and in 181 segments (27%) in 32 patients (80%) on the contrast-enhanced images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean number of segments affected by noncompaction ± SD was 6 ± 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean noncompacted thickness was 5.6 ± 0.2 mm, and the ratio of the noncompacted to compacted layers was 1.1 ± 0.4 on the contrast-enhanced images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The global peak systolic longitudinal strain in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with noncompaction (-12.8% ± 2.8%) had a significantly lower absolute value than that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> without noncompaction (-17.4% ± 1.5%; P&lt; .05) and healthy control participants (-20.6% ± 1.3%; P&lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of segments with noncompaction and the interventricular septal thickness were both independent predictors of the global peak systolic longitudinal strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Contrast echocardiography is superior to standard 2-dimensional echocardiography for detecting subtle noncompaction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the global peak systolic longitudinal strain in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with noncompaction had a significantly lower absolute value than that in patients without noncompaction and healthy controls, indicating that the total number of segments affected by coexistent subtle noncompaction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was an independent predictor of left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
