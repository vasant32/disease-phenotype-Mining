<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether myocardial recovery occurs more frequently in peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (PPCM) than in recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> in men and nonperipartum women has not been prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was examined through an analysis of outcomes in the Intervention in <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>Myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 2 (IMAC2) registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: IMAC2 enrolled 373 subjects with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed at entry and 6 months, and subjects followed for up to 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial recovery was compared between men (group 1), nonperipartum women (group 2) and subjects with PPCM (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cohort included 230 subjects in group 1, 104 in group 2, and 39 in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean LVEF at baseline in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 0.23 ± 0.08, 0.24 ± 0.08, and 0.27 ± 0.07 (P = .04), and at 6 months was 0.39 ± 0.12, 0.42 ± 0.11, and 0.45 ± 0.14 (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects in group 3 had a much greater likelihood of achieving an LVEF &gt;0.50 at 6 months than groups 1 or 2 (19 %, 34%, and 48% respectively, P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prospective evaluation confirms myocardial recovery is greatest in women with PPCM, poorest in men, and intermediate in nonperipartum women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On contemporary therapy, nearly half of women with PPCM normalize cardiac function by 6 months </plain></SENT>
