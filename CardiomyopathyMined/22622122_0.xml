<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of a gender effect (that means differences in clinical manifestations, access to therapies and response to treatments according to gender) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> remains a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent studies have evaluated the differences in the clinical features and prognosis between the two sexes, many issues remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At present, the only sex-specific condition that affects females is peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests a pathogenetic role of a prolactin derivative, and ongoing clinical trials are investigating the possibility of targeted therapies using prolactin secretion inhibitors, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> and carbegoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although women were considered so far only carriers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anderson-Fabry disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GSD2B">Danon disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hunter syndrome</z:e> and dystrophinopathies), clinical experience showed a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in females due to random X chromosome inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> diseases (with matrilineal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> may occur in the context of clinical multisystemic involvement without significant gender-related differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autosomal inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> also show different phenotypes and prognostic impact according to gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of a premenopausal protective role of female hormones towards myocardial involvement has been raised by recent data on transtiretin-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> may affect pregnancy, labor and delivery in women, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these conditions are associated with important hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (asymptomatic and without left ventricular outflow tract gradient) usually can tolerate pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, women who are symptomatic before pregnancy or have severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> with important outflow tract gradient are at higher risk and should be referred to a tertiary center to be evaluated on a case by case basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction represents a high-risk condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, information on the clinical course and potential complications in pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is limited to individual reports </plain></SENT>
