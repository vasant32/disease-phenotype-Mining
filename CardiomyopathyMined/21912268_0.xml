<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for exercise in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) recommended aerobic and resistance exercise as being safe and effective; however, the clinical and functional significance of these combined training modalities has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, combined aerobic and resistance training was hypothesized to improve physical function, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with an attention control wait list (ACWL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 10-item Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance Test (CS-PFP10), which simulates common household chores; muscle strength (handgrip and knee extension); and HRQOL (Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire) were evaluated at baseline (T1) and at 12 weeks (T2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The home-based moderate-intensity walking and resistance training program was performed 5 days a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four New York Heart Association class II to III HF patients (mean [SD] age, 60 [10] years; mean [SD] left ventricular ejection fraction, 25% [9%]) were randomized to a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program or to an ACWL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the total group, 58% were New York Heart Association class III HF patients, 50% were white, and 50% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CS-PFP10 total scores were significantly increased in the exercise group, from 45 (18) to 56 (16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire overall summary score was significantly improved (P &lt; .001) at T2 in the exercise intervention group compared with the ACWL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants provided the home-based, combined aerobic and resistance exercise program had significantly improved physical function, muscle strength, symptom severity, and HRQOL compared with the ACWL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study must be interpreted cautiously owing to the limitations of a small sample, data collection from a single center, and differences between control and interventions groups at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combined aerobic and resistance exercise approach may improve physical function in stable HF patients, but further study in a larger, more diverse population is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in this study, the CS-PFP10 instrument demonstrated its ability to identify functional health status in HF patients and thus warrants further testing in a larger sample for possible use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
