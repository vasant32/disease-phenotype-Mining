<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participating individuals have been consented for the return of genetic results, an important but challenging undertaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the inception of the Project we have enrolled 606 probands, and 269 of these had 1670 family members also enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject was evaluated for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>) and pedigrees were categorized as familial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coding regions of 14 genes were resequenced in 311 to 324 probands in five studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two probands were found to carry nonsynonymous rare variants absent in controls, and with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 (CLIA) compliant protocols, relevant genetic results were returned to these probands and their consented relatives by study genetic counselors and physicians in 353 letters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the 51 families that received results &gt;1Â year ago, at least 23 individuals underwent CLIA confirmation testing for their family's rare variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Return of genetic results has been successfully undertaken in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> Research Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report describes the methods utilized in the process of returning research results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We use this information as a springboard for providing guidance to other genetic research groups and proposing future directions in this arena </plain></SENT>
