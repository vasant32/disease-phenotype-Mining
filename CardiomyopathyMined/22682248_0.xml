<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is also prominently induced with disease where it regulates protein production and resolution of misfolded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a function for Thbs as ER-resident effectors of an adaptive ER stress response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thbs4 cardiac-specific transgenic mice were protected from myocardial injury, whereas Thbs4(-/-) mice were sensitized to cardiac maladaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thbs induction produced a unique profile of adaptive ER stress response factors and expansion of the ER and downstream vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thbs bind the ER lumenal domain of activating transcription factor 6α (Atf6α) to promote its nuclear shuttling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thbs4(-/-) mice showed blunted activation of Atf6α and other ER stress-response factors with injury, and Thbs4-mediated protection was lost upon Atf6α deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, Thbs can function inside the cell during disease remodeling to augment ER function and protect through a mechanism involving regulation of Atf6α </plain></SENT>
