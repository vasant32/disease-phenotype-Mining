<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors systematically reviewed current literature and carried out a meta-analysis to determine the ability of MTWA to predict the outcome severity after ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major endpoints include composite endpoint of cardiac mortality and severe arrhythmic events in primary prevention of patients with ICM, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and/or non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven trials were included by using MTWA for risk stratification of cardiac events in 3385 patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were distributed into two groups according to the results of MTWA tests: non-negative group included positive and indeterminate, and negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the negative group, non-negative group showed increased rates of cardiac mortality or severe arrhythmic events (RR=1.65, 95%CrI=1.32, 2.071), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) (RR=2.04 95%CrI=1.11, 3.75), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (RR=2.11, 95%CrI=1.60, 2.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The funnel plot revealed that there might be bias within current publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fail-safe number of composite endpoint and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 14.42 and 18.93, respectively (when P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fail-safe number of SCD was 1.07 (when P=0.05), which may be caused by the small case number of included studies and some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The non-negative group of MTWA had a nearly double risk of severe outcomes compared with the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, MTWA represents a potential useful tool for judging the severity of ICM </plain></SENT>
