<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although historically difficult to make, the diagnosis of TTR cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> has become easier in recent years with advances in cardiac imaging and more widespread use of genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although therapy has largely involved supportive medical care, avoidance of potentially toxic agents, and rarely organ transplantation, the near future brings the possibility of targeted pharmacotherapies designed to prevent TTR misfolding and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because these disease-modifying agents are designed to prevent disease progression, it has become increasingly important that older persons with TTR <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> be expeditiously identified and considered for enrollment in clinical registries and trials </plain></SENT>
