<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several disease causing genes have been identified and most code for sarcomere proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have carried out clinical and molecular analysis of FHC patients from India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FHC was detected using echocardiography and by analysis of clinical symptoms and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease causing mutations in the Î²-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and Myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) genes were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (PCR-DNA) sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 patient samples screened, mutations were detected in only nineteen in the two genes; MYBPC3 mutations were identified in 12 patients while MYH7 mutations were identified in five, two patients exhibited double heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four MYH7 mutations were missense mutations, whereas only 3/9 MYPBC3 mutations were missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four novel mutations in MYBPC3 viz. c.456delC, c.2128G&gt;A (p.E710K), c.3641G&gt;A (p.W1214X), and c.3656T&gt;C (p.L1219P) and one in MYH7 viz. c.965C&gt;T (p.S322F) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A majority of missense mutations affected conserved amino acid residues and were predicted to alter the structure of the corresponding mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study has revealed a greater frequency of occurrence of MYBPC3 mutations when compared to MYH7 mutations </plain></SENT>
