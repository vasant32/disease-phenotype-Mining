<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) is a major cardiovascular (CV) complication in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp>, and an association between polymorphisms in the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene, a genetic marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and LVH and Left ventricular (LV) concentric remodelling has been recently documented in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is a prominent feature in LVH induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, we tested the hypothesis that the interaction between ENPP1 rs1974201 and rs9402349 polymorphisms and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1)--a pro-fibrotic protein which inhibits extracellular matrix degradation--is implicated in concentric LVH and diastolic dysfunction in a cohort of 223 dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both ENPP1 polymorphisms rs1974201 and rs9402349 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an analysis stratified by ENPP1, rs1974201 polymorphism, circulating levels of TIMP-1 in GG patients were coherently associated with two markers of concentric remodelling [relative wall thickness (RWT) and LV mass-to-volume ratio] as well as with a marker of diastolic dysfunction (E/A ratio) (P ranging from 0.005 to 0.02), whereas no such associations existed in CC or CG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the rs1974201 modifies the relationship between TIMP-1 and LV geometry and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in a multiple regression model, an identical increase of TIMP-1 (100 ng/mL) was associated with an increase of 22% in RWT, 14% in LV mass-to-volume ratio and 29% in E/A ratio in GG patients but with almost no change (from -0.22 to -3.78%) in these echocardiographic indices in the remaining patients (P for the effect modification â‰¤ 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rs9402349 did not modify the relationship between TIMP-1 and LV geometry and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, the ENPP1 rs1974201 polymorphism modifies the association between TIMP-1 and LV geometry and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> is involved not only in LVH but also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, an alteration of primary importance in the high risk of this population </plain></SENT>
