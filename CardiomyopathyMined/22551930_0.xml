<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New anti-neoplastic drugs have improved survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients but have also been associated with chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CCMP), ultimately requiring orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with CCMP treated with OHT and compare them with outcomes of patients with other forms of non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively identified 232 CCMP patients and 8,890 NICMP patients from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry who underwent OHT between January 2000 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Categoric characteristics and outcomes groups were compared using the Ï‡(2) and Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons for continuous variables were made using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses of predictors of survival were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Short-term and long-term post-transplant survival of the 232 CCMP patients was similar to the 8,890 NICMP patients (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival (95% confidence interval) at 1, 3, and 5 years was, respectively, 86% (0.81-0.91), 79% (0.76-0.87), and 71% 0.73-0.85) in the CCMP patients and 87% (0.86-0.88), 81% (0.82-0.84), and 74% (0.80-0.81) in the NICMP patients (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with NICMP patients, CCMP patients had higher rates of post-OHT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (22% vs 14%, p = 004) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (5% vs 2%, p = 0.006), but neither affected survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was only 1 malignancy recurrence in the CCMP patients and no differences in post-OHT <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, CCMP patients were twice as likely as NICMP patients to require right ventricular assist devices before OHT (5.6% vs 2.3%, p = 0.0021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CCMP selected for OHT are younger, have less comorbidity, and are more likely to require biventricular mechanical support pre-OHT than other NICMP patients who receive allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite the higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in CCMP patients who have received a heart transplant, their survival is comparable to those who receive allografts for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
