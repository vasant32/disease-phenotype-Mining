<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened for the presence of LVNC and related clinical characteristics in a 5-generation Chinese family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comprehensive medical history was obtained from 40 members in a 5-generation Chinese family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic clinical investigations including echocardiography (UCG), routine and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), X-rays were performed in 33 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance image (MRI) was carried out in 2 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004763'>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary pedigree analysis revealed that offspring from female patients were at the highest risk to be affected by LVNC (15/18, 83.3%) while LVNC was absent in offspring of male LVNC patients (0/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were more severe in female LVNC patients than in male LVNC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary familial investigation reveals the matrilineal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of familial LVNC in this 5-generation Chinese family, further investigations are warranted to explore the potential mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome responsible for LVNC in this family </plain></SENT>
