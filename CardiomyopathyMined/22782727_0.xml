<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review the evidence that the high wall stress of the RV during intense sports may explain observed B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) elevations immediately after a race, may lead to cellular disruption and leaking of cardiac enzymes, and may even result in transient RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over time, this could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> remodelling and a pro-arrhythmic state resembling arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ARVC in high-endurance athletes most often develops in the absence of underlying desmosomal abnormalities, probably only as a result of excessive RV wall stress during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have labelled this syndrome 'exercise-induced ARVC' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sports cardiologists should be aware that excessive sports activity can lead to cardiac sports injuries in some individuals, just like orthopaedic specialists are familiar with musculoskeletal sports injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This does not negate the fact that moderate exercise has positive cardiovascular effects and should be encouraged </plain></SENT>
