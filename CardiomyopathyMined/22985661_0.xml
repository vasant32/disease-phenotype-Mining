<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the article published on this issue in Heart Rhythm, Marra et al. studied 20 consecutive patients with TTC using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and 12-lead ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors suggested that the apico-basal gradient of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is a cause of the ECG pattern in patients with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was because significany clinical association was demonstrated between the repolarization abnormalities on ECG and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> as evidenced by apico-basal signal intensity gradient on CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study by Marra et al. give us a new and important insight both into the reversible wall motion abnormality and transiently observed ECG characteristics of TTC </plain></SENT>
