<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim: To determine the prevalence of left atrial (LA) enlargement and its relation to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction among asymptomatic diabetic outpatients attending Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Echocardiography was performed in 122 type 2 and 58 type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction was defined as peak transmitral blood velocity to medial mitral annulus velocity (E/E') ratio ≥ 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LA volume indexed to body surface area (LAVI) was considered enlarged if ≥ 29 ml/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Enlarged LAVI and LV diastolic dysfunction were more common in type 2 than in type 1 diabetic patients (44.3 vs 25.9% and 20.5 vs 3.5%, respectively, both p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate linear regression analysis, larger LAVI was associated with LV diastolic dysfunction independent of significant associations with LV mass index and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients, while LV mass index, lower ejection fraction and longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were the main covariates of larger LAVI in type 1 diabetic patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Enlarged LA is common among asymptomatic Tanzanian diabetic patients, and particularly associated with LV diastolic dysfunction in type 2, and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and lower systolic function in type 1 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
