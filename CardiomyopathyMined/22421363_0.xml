<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that the intercalated disc (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) required for mechano-electrical coupling in the heart consists of three distinct junctional complexes: adherens junctions, desmosomes and gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent morphological and molecular data indicate a mixing of adherens junctional and desmosomal components, resulting in a 'hybrid adhering junction' or 'area composita' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The α-catenin family member αT-catenin, part of the N-cadherin-catenin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> complex in the heart, is the only α-catenin that interacts with the desmosomal protein plakophilin-2 (PKP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, it has been postulated that αT-catenin might serve as a molecular integrator of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> complexes in the area composita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of αT-catenin in the heart, gene targeting technology was used to delete the Ctnna3 gene, encoding αT-catenin, in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The αT-catenin-null mice are viable and fertile; however, the animals exhibit progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adherens junctional and desmosomal proteins were unaffected by loss of αT-catenin, with the exception of the desmosomal protein PKP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunogold labeling at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> demonstrated in the αT-catenin-null heart a preferential reduction of PKP2 at the area composita compared with the desmosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gap junction protein Cx43 was reduced at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, including its colocalization with N-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gap junction remodeling in αT-catenin-knockout hearts was associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This novel animal model demonstrates for the first time how perturbation in αT-catenin can affect both PKP2 and Cx43 and thereby highlights the importance of understanding the crosstalk between the junctional proteins of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and its implications for arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
