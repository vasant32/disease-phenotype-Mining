<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study retrospectively investigated the incidence, demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients with SAH complicated with both NPE and TCM (NPE-TCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location and other clinical variables on the incidence of NPE-TCM were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 234 SAH patients treated during 5-year period, 16 (7%) presented with NPE, and transthoracic ultrasonography revealed that 14 of these 16 patients (88%) also had TCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients with NPE-TCM had poor-grade SAH (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades IV and V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ruptured posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was predictive of NPE-TCM, but other clinical variables were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 14 patients with NPE-TCM could undergo treatment for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes were favorable in 5 of the 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade IV SAH patients had significantly better outcomes than grade V patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCM develops frequently in SAH patients presenting with NPE, and transthoracic ultrasonography should be conducted routinely in that population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ruptured posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may have elevated risk of developing NPE-TCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endovascular obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may be preferable to open surgery, but the optimal treatment modality needs to be evaluated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considering the limited number of SAH patients complicated with NPE-TCM, a multi-center cooperative study may be required </plain></SENT>
