<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> is a naturally occurring compound which is known to inhibit PKC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on ameliorating diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are still undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment is associated with the modulation of PKC-α and -β(2)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in experimental diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> (100mg/kg/day) was started three weeks after STZ injection and was given for 8weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> significantly prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced translocation of PKC-α and -β2 to membranous fraction and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK and extracellular regulated-signal kinase (ERK)1/2 in left ventricular tissues of diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> treatment also markedly decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase subunits (p67phox, p22phox, gp91phox), growth factors (transforming growth factor-β, osteopontin) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 protein expression as well as inhibited NF-κB activity at nuclear level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> decreased the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of transcriptional coactivator p300 and atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, decreased accumulation of ECM protein and reversed the increment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in left ventricular tissues, as evidenced by dihydroethidium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also significantly lowered plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and attenuated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as determined by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and activity of anti-oxidant enzyme, and as a result attenuated cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> and left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> by inhibiting PKC-α and -β(2)-MAPK pathway may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
