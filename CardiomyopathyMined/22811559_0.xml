<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rationale: Autoantibodies directed against the second extracellular loop of the cardiac β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and Chagas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various approaches have been used to detect such autoantibodies; however, the reported prevalence varies largely, depending on the detection method used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: We analyzed sera from 167 DCM patients (ejection fraction &lt;45%) and from 110 age-matched volunteers who did not report any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> themselves, with an often used simple <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-ELISA approach, and compared it with a novel whole cell-based ELISA, using cells expressing the full transgene for the human β1-AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> with preserved ejection fraction were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: The novel assay was designed according to the currently most reliable anti-TSH receptor antibody-ELISA used to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100647'>Graves disease</z:hpo> ("third-generation assay") and also detects the target antibodies by competition with a specific monoclonal anti-β1-AR antibody (β1-AR MAb) directed against the functionally relevant β1-AR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-β1-AR antibodies were detected in ≈60% of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients and in ≈8% of healthy volunteers using the same cutoff values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of these antibodies was 17% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-β1-AR antibody titers (defined as inhibition of β1-AR MAb-binding) were no longer detected after depleting sera from IgG antibodies by protein G adsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a previously used ELISA conducted with a linear 26-meric <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> derived from the second extracellular β1-AR loop yielded a high number of false-positive results precluding any specific identification of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We established a simple and efficient screening assay detecting disease-relevant β1-AR autoantibodies in patient sera yielding a high reproducibility also in high throughput screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The assay was validated according to "good laboratory practice" and can serve as a companion biodiagnostic assay for the development and evaluation of antibody-directed therapies in antibody-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
