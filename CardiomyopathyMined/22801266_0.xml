<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DSE and EE were performed in 40 consecutive patients with HCM and LVOT gradient &lt; 50 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dobutamine was administered intravenously at incremental doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1200 µg/min at 5 min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVOT gradients were measured at rest, at peak exercise and during each dose of DSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LVOT gradient at rest was lower than 30 mm Hg in 36 patients and between 30 and 49 mm Hg in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 patients with LVOT gradient &lt; 30 mm Hg at rest, mechanical LVOT obstruction (latent <z:mp ids='MP_0010448'>LVOTO</z:mp>) was evidenced in 17 patients during EE and in 18 patients during DSE and good consistency (91.7%, kappa value 0.833) was found between the two maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The provoked gradient was similar between DSE at 800 µg/min and EE at peak exercise (P = 0.181) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 4 patients with LVOT gradient between 30 and 49 mm Hg [(38.8 ± 2.6) mm Hg], LVOT gradient increased to (85.3 ± 26.4) mm Hg during EE and (105.0 ± 28.0) mm Hg during DES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DES and EE are comparable and suitable provoke methods for identifying LVOT obstruction in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
