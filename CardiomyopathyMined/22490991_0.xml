<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is an association between NAFLD and echocardiographically detected LVH in Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 116 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after excluding those with pre-existing history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, excessive alcohol consumption and other known causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (e.g., virus, medications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NAFLD was diagnosed by means of ultrasonography, whereas LVH was diagnosed by means of conventional trans-thoracic echocardiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of LVH was markedly higher among diabetic patients with NAFLD than among those without this disease (82% vs 18%; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that NAFLD was associated with LVH independently of age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and parameters of kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD have a remarkably higher frequency of LVH than do hypertensive diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, and that NAFLD is associated with LVH independently of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
