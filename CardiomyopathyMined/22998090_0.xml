<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Assess ability of NT-proBNP assay to detect ODCM and predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: 155 asymptomatic Dobermans presenting for ODCM screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiography, 24-hour Holter, and NT-proBNP assay were performed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on increased left ventricular end-systolic dimension, &gt;50 ventricular premature complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>), or both on Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utility was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effect of age, weight, sex, disease status, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>, and NT-proBNP on survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three (47.1%) Dobermans were diagnosed with ODCM, including 31, 17, and 25 that met Holter, echocardiographic, or both criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of NT-proBNP &gt; 457 pmol/L to detect these groups was 45.2, 76.5, and 96.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination of NT-proBNP and Holter to detect ODCM yielded sensitivity of 94.5%, specificity of 87.8%, and accuracy of 91.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available for 78 Dobermans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival time of Dobermans with &gt; 50 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> (469 days), NT-proBNP &gt; 900 pmol/L (284 days), or ODCM (474 days) was significantly (P &lt; .0001) shorter than those with &lt; 50 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> (1743 days), NT-proBNP &lt; 900 pmol/L (1743 days), or without disease (1743 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP concentration and disease status were independently predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The combination of NT-proBNP assay and Holter detected ODCM with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP and disease status were independently associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP assay identified Dobermans with high probability of increased LVIDs consistent with ODCM, and can facilitate pursuit of confirmatory diagnostic testing, such as echocardiography, in suspected Dobermans </plain></SENT>
