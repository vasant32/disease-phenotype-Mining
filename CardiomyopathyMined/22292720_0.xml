<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze TNNT2 gene exons in patients with HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> diagnosis to improve diagnostic and genetic consultancy in affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 exons and their flanking regions of the TNNT2 gene were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis in 174 patients with HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified genetic variations in TNNT2 exon regions in 56 patients and genetic variations in TNNT2 intron regions in 164 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were found to carry unique mutations in the TNNT2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Limited genetic screening analysis is not suitable for routine testing of disease-causing mutations in patients with HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> as only individual mutation-positive cases may be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this approach cannot be recommended for daily clinical practice even though, due to financial constraints, it currently represents the only available strategy in a majority of cardio-centers </plain></SENT>
