<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotype/phenotype correlations are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, multisystemic involvement has been reported only in kindred harboring the R120G substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a novel CRYAB mutation, D109H, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001115'>posterior polar cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in a two-generation family with five affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo>, clinical presentation, and muscle abnormalities were very similar to those described in the R120G family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alpha-B crystallin may form dimers and acts as a chaperone for a number of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the phenotypic diversity could be related to the various interactions between target proteins of individual mutant residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling indicates that residues D109 and R120 interact with each other during dimerization of alpha-B crystallin; interestingly, the two substitutions affecting these residues (D109H and R120G) are associated with the same clinical phenotype, thus suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that impairment of alpha-B crystallin dimerization may also be relevant to the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
