<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of erythropoietin on cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 5 groups: sham control; sham+ erythropoietin; bile duct ligation; bile duct ligation+erythropoietin; bile duct ligation+erythropoietin+anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFα) antibody and were studied 4wk after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin was administrated for 10 days before the study date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TNFα, erythropoietin receptor-1 expression and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related parameters were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In separate groups, isolated cardiomyocytes were subjected to contractile and relaxation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte cell line was used to test the direct effect of erythropoietin on nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2(Nrf2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Erythropoietin receptor-1, TNFα and oxidative modified proteins were significantly increased (p&lt;0.01), and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> regulator Nrf2 transcription decreased in cirrhotic hearts (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin reversed these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maximal cardiac contractile and relaxation velocity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin significantly reversed these inhibitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-TNFα antibody significantly decreased cardiac TNFα content but did not further increase contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TNFα and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are involved in cardiac dysfunction in the cirrhotic heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin significantly decreased TNFα and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and reversed the impaired cardiac function </plain></SENT>
