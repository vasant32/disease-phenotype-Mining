<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormal left ventricular (LV) deformational mechanics have been demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) at rest, but there is a lack of information on their adaptation to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the adaptability of LV strains and torsional mechanics during exercise in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty nonobstructive HCM patients (age, 48.3±12.3 years; 14 men) and 20 control subjects underwent speckle-tracking echocardiographic measurement of longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strains, systolic twist, and diastolic untwisting rate (UTR) at rest and submaximal exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HCM patients showed lower resting longitudinal (-15.7±5.0% versus -19.4±2.6%, P&lt;0.001) and radial (38.1±11.3% versus 44.7±14.4%, P&lt;0.05) strains but higher circumferential strain (-21.9±4.0% versus -18.8±2.3%, P&lt;0.05) and twist (15.7±3.6° versus 9.3±2.6°, P&lt;0.0001) than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise induced an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strains in control subjects but only a moderate increase in longitudinal strain (to -18.4±5.0%), without significant changes in radial and circumferential strains or twist in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise peak UTR was lower (-119.0±31.5°/s versus -137.3±41.1°/s) and occurred later (137±18% versus 125±11% systolic time, P&lt;0.05) in HCM than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship between twist and UTR was obtained in control subjects (ß=-0.0807, P&lt;0.001) but not in HCM patients (ß=-0.0051, P=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HCM patients had severely limited strain adaptability and no LV twisting reserve at exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had reduced and delayed UTR with reduced systolic-diastolic coupling efficiency by twist-untwist mechanics </plain></SENT>
