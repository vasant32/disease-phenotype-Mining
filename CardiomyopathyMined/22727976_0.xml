<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this small, prospective, double-blind study, we randomly assigned 45 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and planned chemotheraphy to receive nebivolol 5mg daily (n=27) or placebo (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic measurements and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-pro-BNP) levels were obtained at baseline and at 6-month of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both studied groups had comparable echocardiographic variables and NT-pro-BNP levels at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 6-month, the left ventricular (LV) end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters increased in the placebo group (LVESD: 29.7±3.4 to 33.4±4.5mm; LVEDD: 47.2±3.8 to 52.0±4.6mm, p=0.01 for both) but remained unchanged in the nebivolol group (LVESD: 30.4±3.5 to 31.0±3.6mm, p=0.20; LVEDD: 47.0±4.4 to 47.1±4.0mm, p=0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The placebo group also had lower LVEF than the nebivolol group (57.5±5.6% vs. 63.8±3.9%, p=0.01) at 6-month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NT-pro-BNP level remained static in the nebivolol group (147±57 to 152±69 pmol/l, p=0.77) while it increased in the placebo group (144±66 to 204±73 pmol/l, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of nebivolol treatment may protect the myocardium against antracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
