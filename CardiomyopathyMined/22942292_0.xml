<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of percutaneous interventions with newer generation drug-eluting stents has advanced a lot over the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This improvement in stent performance has broadened the level of indication towards more complex interventions such as left main and multi-vessel PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major improvements continue in the field of medical co-therapy such as antiplatelet therapies (bivalirudin, prasugrel, ticagrelor) and this will further improve outcomes of PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same is true for intravascular imaging such as ultrasound IVUS and optical coherence tomography OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, interventional cardiology has become a rather broad field, also including alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the moment, the fastest growing area is the structural interventions, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> (transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (mitral clipping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review covers recent advances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these different fields of interventional cardiology </plain></SENT>
