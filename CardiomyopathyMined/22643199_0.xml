<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Cardiotoxicity is a known complication of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> therapies, but rates come from clinical trials with design features that limit external validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to accurately identify cardiotoxicity from administrative data would enhance safety information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To characterize the performance of clinical coding algorithms for identification of cardiac dysfunction in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN:: We sampled 400 charts among 6460 women diagnosed with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size â‰¥2 cm or node positivity, treated within 8 US health care systems between 1999 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We abstracted medical records for clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CM) or evidence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then assessed the performance of 3 different International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9)-based algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The HF/CM coding algorithm designed a priori to balance performance characteristics provided a sensitivity of 62% (95% confidence interval, 40%-80%), specificity of 99% (range, 97% to 99%), positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 69% (range, 45% to 85%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% (range, 96% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When applied only to incident HF/CM (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes and gold standard diagnosis both occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis) in patients exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> and/or trastuzumab therapy, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 42% (range, 14% to 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Claims-based algorithms have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for identifying HF/CM among patients with invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the prevalence of HF/CM among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> population is low, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes have high NPV but only moderate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification due to HF/CM overcoding versus incomplete clinical documentation of HF/CM in the medical record </plain></SENT>
