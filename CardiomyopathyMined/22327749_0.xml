<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement is frequently observed in the most common form, PMM2-CDG, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, however, has been only observed in a few CDG subtypes, usually with a lethal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on cardiac pathology in nine patients from three unrelated Israeli families, diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16091">dolichol</z:chebi> kinase deficiency, due to novel, homozygous DK1 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac symptoms varied from discrete, mild dilation to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two children died unexpectedly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> before the diagnosis of DK1-CDG and heart transplantation could take place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three other affected children with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at the time of the diagnosis deteriorated rapidly, two of them within days after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> went through successful heart transplantation; one died unexpectedly and 2 others are currently (after 1-5Â years) clinically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 4 children diagnosed with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are doing well on supportive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the cardiac findings dominated the clinical picture, without central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or multisystem involvement, which is unique in CDG syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest to test for DK1-CDG in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with discrete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may remain stable on supportive treatment while others deteriorate rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our paper is the first comprehensive study on the phenotype of DK1-CDG and the first successful organ transplantation in CDG syndrome </plain></SENT>
