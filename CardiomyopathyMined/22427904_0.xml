<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) is a progressive and fatal disease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> caused by loss of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the heart, DMD results in progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and dilation of the left ventricle through mechanisms that are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have shown that loss of dystrophin causes sarcolemmal instability and reduced mechanical compliance of isolated cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To expand upon these findings, here we have subjected the left ventricles of dystrophin-deficient mdx hearts to mechanical stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, isolated mdx hearts showed increased left ventricular (LV) compliance compared to controls during stretch as LV volume was increased above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> end diastolic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During LV chamber distention, sarcomere lengths increased similarly in mdx and WT hearts despite greater excursions in volume of mdx hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the mechanical properties of the intact heart cannot be modeled as a simple extrapolation of findings in single cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To explain these findings, a model is proposed in which disruption of the dystrophin-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> complex perturbs cell-extracellular matrix contacts and promotes the apparent slippage of myocytes past each other during LV distension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, similar increases in LV compliance were obtained in isolated hearts from β-sarcoglycan-null and laminin-α(2) mutant mice, but not in dysferlin-null mice, suggesting that increased whole-organ compliance in mdx mice is a specific effect of disrupted cell-extracellular matrix contacts and not a general consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> via membrane defect processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings suggest a novel and cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> independent mechanism for the progressive pathological LV dilation that occurs in DMD </plain></SENT>
