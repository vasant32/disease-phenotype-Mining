<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations affecting the expression of dystrophin result in progressive loss of skeletal muscle function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> leading to early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, clinical studies revealed no correlation in disease severity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> between cardiac and skeletal muscles, suggesting that dystrophin may play overlapping yet different roles in these two striated muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since dystrophin serves as a structural and signaling scaffold, functional differences likely arise from tissue-specific protein interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, we optimized a proteomics-based approach to purify, identify and compare the interactome of dystrophin between cardiac and skeletal muscles from as little as 50 mg of starting material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found selective tissue-specific differences in the protein associations of cardiac and skeletal muscle full length dystrophin to syntrophins and dystrobrevins that couple dystrophin to signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we identified novel cardiac-specific interactions of dystrophin with proteins known to regulate cardiac contraction and to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our approach overcomes a major challenge in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> field of rapidly and consistently identifying bona fide dystrophin-interacting proteins in tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our findings support the existence of cardiac-specific functions of dystrophin and may guide studies into early triggers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> in Duchenne and Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
