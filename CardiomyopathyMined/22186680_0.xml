<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients with intestinal bypass as treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> underwent endomyocardial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were processed by histology, electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cardiotropic viruses, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of 33 myocardial trace elements, and assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPX) activity and LC3-II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology and electron microscopy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>/degeneration of cardiomyocytes with pronounced cell autophagy and high expression of LC3-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR was negative for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INAA showed severe myocardial <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (Se) and zinc (Zn) deficiency and reduced GPX activity vs. both patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Se and Zn were added to antifailing heart therapy in 10 patients (group A1) agreeing to a control biopsy, and the response was compared with that of 8 patients (group A2) on supportive therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, myocardial normalization of Se, Zn, LC3-II, and GPX in group A1 was associated with recovery of cardiomyocyte degeneration and autophagy, and significant improvement in cardiac dimension and function, that remained unchanged in group A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A reversible Se- and Zn-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may occur in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>intestinal malabsorption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by decline of myocardial <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reserve, oxidative damage of cell membranes, and enhanced cell autophagy </plain></SENT>
