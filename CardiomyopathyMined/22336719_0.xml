<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite increasing survival rates in the past years, current standard therapeutic strategies are far away from being optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the concept of cardiac gene therapy for the treatment of HF holds great potential to improve disease progression, as it specifically targets key pathologies of diseased cardiomyocytes (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The small calcium (Ca(2+))-binding protein S100A1 presents a promising target for cardiac gene therapy, as it has been identified as a central regulator of cardiac performance and the Ca(2+)-driven network within CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S100A1 was shown to regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum, sarcomere and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function by modulating target protein activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, deranged S100A1 expression has been linked to HF in human ischemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> as well as in various HF animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proof-of-concept studies in small and large animal models as wells as in human failing CM could demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of S100A1 genetically targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the developmental steps of S100A1 gene therapy for the implementation into first human clinical trials </plain></SENT>
