<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the diagnosis of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>noncompaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NCM) can be overlooked, its association with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> (CHDs) makes the diagnosis of NCM even more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the impact of NCM on the cardiovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of children with coexisting CHDs evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was performed with 12 children (6 patients with combined NCM and CHD and 6 control subjects with isolated CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices were significantly higher in the CHD patients presenting with NCM than in the CHD patients with no NCM (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed for right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices, biventricular ejection fractions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes and indices, left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular fractional shortening, cardiac output, or cardiac index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that NCM in children with CHDs increases left ventricular volumes, and larger studies are required to demonstrate other changes (e.g., ejection fraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume) that were close to being significant </plain></SENT>
