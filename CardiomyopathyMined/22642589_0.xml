<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats underwent right nephrectomy and were randomly assigned into 3 groups: control group (CON group: <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tube was embedded subcutaneously); DOCA treated group (DOC group: 200 mg of DOCA was subcutaneously administered); DOCA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="601027">Aliskiren</z:chebi> (ALI) treated group (ALI group: 200 mg of DOCA and 50 mg/kg/d ALI were subcutaneously and intragastrically given, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was done for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sirius red staining was employed to detect the expression of myocardial collagen, and the myocardial collagen volume fraction (CVF) and perivascular collagen volume area (PVCA) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunoassay was carried out to measure the renin activity (RA) and content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>) in the plasma and ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot assay was done to detect the expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (PERK1/2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the DOC group and ALI group, the CVF and PVCA were significantly increased; the RA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> levels in the plasma and ventricle were remarkably lowered when compared with the CON group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> levels in the ventricle of the ALI group were significantly lower than those in the DOC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the expressions of ERK1/2, PERK1/2 and MMP9 were the lowest in the CON group, but those in the ALI group were significantly reduced as compared to the DOC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ALI can inhibit the DOCA induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> independent of its pressure-lowing effect, which may be related to the suppression of RA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> production, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MMP9 expression in the heart </plain></SENT>
