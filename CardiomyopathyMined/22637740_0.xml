<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of exercise training and exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on symptom-free exercise capacity, cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function, quality of life, general healthy lifestyle, and reduction of depressive symptoms and psychosocial stress is nowadays well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains largely obscure, which characteristics of physical activity (PA) and exercise training - frequency, intensity, time (duration), type (mode), and volume (dose: intensity Ã— duration) of exercise - are the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present paper, therefore, will deal with these exercise characteristics in the management of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients, but also in patients with congenital or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the current literature, and if sufficient evidence is available, recommendations from the European Association on Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation are formulated regarding frequency, intensity, time and type of PA, and safety aspects during exercise in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper is the third in a series of three papers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> devoted to the same theme: the importance of the exercise characteristics in the management of cardiovascular health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Part I is directed to the general population and Part II to individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, PA recommendations and exercise training programmes for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> need to be tailored to the individual's exercise capacity and risk profile, with the aim to reach and maintain the individually highest fitness level possible and to perform endurance exercise training 30-60 min daily (3-5 days per week) in combination with resistance training 2-3 times a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the frequently reported dose-response relationship between training effect and exercise intensity, one should seek sufficiently high training intensities, although more scientific evidence on effect sizes and safety is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At present, there is insufficient data to give more specific recommendations on type, dosage, and intensity of exercise in some other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, valve disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e>, and patients with implanted devices </plain></SENT>
