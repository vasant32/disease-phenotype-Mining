<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myopalladin (MYPN) is a Z-disc protein expressed in striated muscle and functions as a structural, signaling and gene expression regulating molecule in response to muscle stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MYPN was genetically screened in 900 patients with HCM, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and RCM, and disease-causing mechanisms were investigated using comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the patient myocardium and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes expressing mutant MYPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac-restricted transgenic (Tg) mice were generated and protein-protein interactions were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two nonsense and 13 missense MYPN variants were identified in subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, HCM and RCM with the average <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> prevalence of 1.66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional studies were performed on two variants (Q529X and Y20C) associated with variable clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Humans carrying the Y20C-MYPN variant developed HCM or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, whereas Q529X-MYPN was found in familial RCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disturbed myofibrillogenesis with disruption of Î±-actinin2, desmin and cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) was evident in rat cardiomyocytes expressing MYPN(Q529X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac-restricted MYPN(Y20C) Tg mice developed HCM and disrupted intercalated discs, with disturbed expression of desmin, desmoplakin, connexin43 and vinculin being evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Failed nuclear translocation and reduced binding of Y20C-MYPN to CARP were demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MYPN mutations cause various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> via different protein-protein interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Q529X-MYPN causes RCM via disturbed myofibrillogenesis, whereas Y20C-MYPN perturbs MYPN nuclear shuttling and leads to abnormal assembly of terminal Z-disc within the cardiac transitional junction and intercalated disc </plain></SENT>
