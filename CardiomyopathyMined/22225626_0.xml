<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiospheres are self-assembling three-dimensional (3D) microtissues formed by cardiac stem cells and supporting cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of cardiospheres to augment cardiac function has been demonstrated in animal models of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we studied the dose dependence of the benefits of human cardiospheres, delivered via intramyocardial injection, upon cardiac function and ventricular remodelling in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four doses of cardiospheres were used: 1 × 10(4) , 5 × 10(4) , 1 × 10(5) and 5 × 10(5) (expressed as number of plated cardiosphere-forming cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> (24 hr) cell retention rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional assessment and quantitative heart morphometry indicated benefit from higher cell doses (≥5 × 10(4) ) in terms of ejection fraction, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and capillary density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis indicated that the dose-dependent benefit was primarily because of indirect effects of transplanted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results provide scalable data on cardiosphere dosing for intramyocardial injection </plain></SENT>
