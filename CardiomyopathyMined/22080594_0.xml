<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) is known to attenuate ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect mainly resulted from an increase in mobilization and homing of CD34+/CD45+ cells into the ischaemic myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTH-related stem cell mobilization was shown to be related to endogenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to determine the role of G-CSF on the cardioprotective effects of PTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: G-CSF +/+ (C57BL/6) and G-CSF -/- mice were treated with PTH for 6 days after inducing a MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myocardial homing factor stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was analysed on day 2 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stem cell populations in peripheral blood and hearts were examined by FACS on days 6 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function and immunohistochemistry were investigated on day 6 and day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PTH treatment resulted in a significant increase in CD45+/CD34+ cells in peripheral blood in G-CSF +/+ but not in G-CSF -/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a significant increase in SDF-1 and enhanced migration of CD45+/CD34+ cells into the ischaemic myocardium was revealed after PTH administration in both G-CSF +/+ and G-CSF -/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enhanced stem cell homing was associated with improved cardiac function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> survival after PTH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, wall thickness, and neovascularization showed a significant improvement in both groups 30 days after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cardioprotective effects of PTH were shown to be independent of endogenous G-CSF release and therefore from stem cell mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This puts more emphasis on the role of stem cell homing into ischaemic myocardium </plain></SENT>
