<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 were in New York Heart Association class IV, and 27 were in class III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology was ischemic in 18 patients and idiopathic dilated in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve repair was performed in 25 patients, and 17 had mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 33.41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 44.52 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median functional class improved from 3 to 2 during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction improved from 24% to 42% at 6 weeks, then decreased to 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The midterm survival rate was 86%, and 81% after 1 and 2 years </plain></SENT>
