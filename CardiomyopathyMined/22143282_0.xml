<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its portability, lack of ionizing radiation, excellent temporal and spatial resolution, and low cost make echocardiography an attractive technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a significant proportion of patients have suboptimal images that decrease the diagnostic utility of echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One method to enhance the assessment of cardiac structure and function involves the administration of microbubble contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Capitalizing on interactions between microbubbles and ultrasound, imaging modalities that were specifically designed to enhance microbubble signal while suppressing tissue signal have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These modalities can be used for either left ventricular opacification or myocardial perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current applications of contrast echocardiography, along with the safety and limitations of the technology will be reviewed </plain></SENT>
