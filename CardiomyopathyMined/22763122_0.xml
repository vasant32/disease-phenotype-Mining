<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, Vit C uptake into cardiomyocytes is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whether the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme reserve is enhanced by Vit C is also not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated an influence of Dox on Vit C transporters, expression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reserve as well as enzymes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in isolated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to control (culture medium 199 alone), Dox (10 μM), Vit C (25 μM), and Vit C + Dox for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vit C transporter expression and localization, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression and localization of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> transporter-2 (SVCT-2) in the sarcolemma was reduced by Dox, but Vit C supplementation was able to blunt this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease in the expression of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) due to Dox, but only GPx expression was completely prevented and Cu/Zn SOD was partially rescued by Vit C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dox-induced decrease in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reserve and increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were partially mitigated by Vit C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dox-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was ameliorated by Vit C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that cardioprotection offered by Vit C in Dox-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may involve an upregulation of SVCT-2 transporter followed by a reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> as well as blunting of cardiomyocyte injury </plain></SENT>
