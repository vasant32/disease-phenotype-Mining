<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is the most typical form of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>, and it is traditionally considered refractory to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> remains of paramount importance, and several measures, including serial cardiac function monitoring, reduction of cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> analogues and cardioprotective agents, have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last decade, however, a new approach based on cardiac biomarkers has emerged as an effective alternative strategy for the early detection of subclinical cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the role of troponin I in identifying patients at risk of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> as well as of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> in preventing left ventricular dysfunction and late cardiac events in high-risk patients, namely those with raised troponin I levels after chemotherapy, has been consistently demonstrated as an effective tool for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> prevention </plain></SENT>
