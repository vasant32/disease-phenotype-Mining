<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed in 129 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo> of MD to identify any association between specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> diseases and their symptoms with the aim of optimizing diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective clinical and laboratory data were evaluated in 461 patients (331 families) with confirmed MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo> of MD was reported in 28% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Prematurity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> necessitating ventilatory support were present in one-third, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 40%, neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 16%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh syndrome</z:e> in 15%, and elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level in 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>Hyperammonemia</z:hpo> was observed in 22 out of 52 neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342776" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Complex I deficiency</z:e> was identified in 15, complex III in one, complex IV in 23, complex V in 31, combined deficiency of several complexes in 53, and PDH complex deficiency was identified in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis was confirmed in 49 cases, including a newborn with a 9134A&gt;G mutation in the MTATP6 gene, which has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most significant finding is the high incidence of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our experience, we propose a diagnostic flowchart applicable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> neonates suspicious for MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This tool will allow for the use of direct molecular genetic analyses without the need for muscle biopsies in neonates with Alpers, Barth, MILS and Pearson syndromes, SCO1, SCO2, TMEM70, ATP5E, SUCLG1 gene mutations and PDH complex deficiency </plain></SENT>
