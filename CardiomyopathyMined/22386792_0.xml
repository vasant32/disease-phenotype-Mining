<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported an association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ antigen beta 1 chain (DQB1) alleles and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results of those studies have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the association between HLA-DQB1 and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Searches were performed using the PubMed database, the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, the Science Citation Index database, the China Biology Medicine disc, the China National Knowledge Information database, the Wanfang database, and the Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database (VIP database) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The search terms included "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>" and "DQB1." Ten case-controlled studies were included in the systematic review to assess the association between <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and the HLA-DQB1*0201, *0302, *0504, *0301, and *0602 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 8 studies were included in the meta-analysis of the HLA-DQB1 *0201 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds risk (OR) for this allele was .47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of .28 to .77 (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to the HLA-DQB1 *0504 allele, only 3 studies were included in our meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled OR was .36 (95% CI, .15 to .84; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine, 8, and 7 studies of the HLA-DQB1 *0301, *0302, and *0602 alleles, respectively, were included in our meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was evident in the frequency of these 3 alleles between the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DQB1 *0201 and *0504 alleles may be protective against <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
