<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of anti-β-adrenoceptors autoantibodies (aβAA) in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (IA) and to assess whether aβAA are predictive markers for concealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (group 1) with IA [25 supraventricular (SVA) and 42 ventricular (VA)]; 14 patients (group 2) with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 12 patients with definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (group 3); and 19 healthy controls (group 4) were tested with an enzyme immunoassay, using synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human β1-and β2-adrenoceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endomyocardial biopsy was performed in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with group 4 [3/19 (15.7%)], anti-β1-adrenoceptor autoantibodies (aβ1AA) were more frequent in group-1 patients [38/67 (56.7%; P&lt;0.01): 27/42 (64.2%; P&lt;0.001) with VA and 11/25 (44%; P&lt;0.05) with SVA] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 of the group 1 patients also had anti-β2-adrenoceptor autoantibodies (aβ2AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4 were positive for aβ2AA only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy performed in 11/67 group 1 patients was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of them, 7/8 (87.5%) with VA and 3/3 (100%) with SVA were positive for aβ1AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis from paraffin blocks of the 11 group 1 biopsied patients was negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e>, EBV, HCV, AV, PVB19, INF A/B,HSV1/2, HHV6 and HHV8 <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The second extracellular loop of the β-adrenoceptor is the molecular target of specific autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positivity for aβ1AA predicts abnormal histological findings in 90% of IA patients and suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> might play an arrhythmogenic role </plain></SENT>
