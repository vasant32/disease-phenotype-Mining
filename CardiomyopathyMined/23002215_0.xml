<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, we tested the usefulness of the distal LAD flow visualization by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>) to distinguish between these two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we prospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients with TTC (75 ± 10 years, 93% females) who were compared with 28 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> treated successfully by primary angioplasty (66 ± 12 years, 79% females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent the assessment of the distal LAD flow just before CA, using colour and pulsed-wave <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the symmetric involvement of wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) based on the extent of the disease far beyond one coronary territory in TTC was searched by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive coronary flow reserve (CFR) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>, in the distal LAD, was also performed within 1 day after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before CA, the distal LAD flow was visible in 38 of 56 cases (68%) in the whole population, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with TTC and in 10 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the LAD flow visualization for the diagnosis of TTC were 100 and 64%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the pattern of WMA yielded a Se of 75% and Sp of 86%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the combination of both tools, the Se and Sp to detect TTC were 75 and 96% respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After CA, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CFR was less severely impaired in the TTC group when compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> group (2.2 ± 0.5 vs. 1.7 ± 0.6, P &lt; 0.01) despite a worse LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-invasive evaluation of the distal LAD flow could be helpful to differentiate TTC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, and its combination with the pattern of WMA improved slightly its diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CFR is less severely impaired in TTC compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> despite poorer LV systolic dysfunction, suggesting that other mechanisms than direct microcirculatory damage are also involved in the pathogenesis of WMAs in TTC </plain></SENT>
