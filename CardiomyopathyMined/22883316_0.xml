<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by a two-layered myocardium consisting of a noncompacted inner and a compacted outer layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the thicknesses of these two layers is a major diagnostic criterion, which is, however, often difficult to apply in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 41 patients with LVNC, 41 patients with moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> (AVS), and 41 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal systolic thicknesses of "noncompacta" and "compacta" were measured in standard short-axis views at the apical or midventricular level, in the segment with most prominent recesses (in patients with LVNC) or trabeculation (in patients with AVS and controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean maximal systolic thickness of noncompacta was 1.8 ± 0.4 cm in patients with LVNC compared with 0.2 ± 0.1 cm in controls and 0.6 ± 0.02 cm in patients with AVS (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean maximal systolic thickness of compacta was lower in patients with LVNC (0.5 ± 0.1 cm) compared to controls (1.2 ± 0.2 cm; P &lt; .0001) and patients with AVS (1.6 ± 0.06 cm; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximal systolic thickness of compacta was ≤8.1 mm in patients with LVNC compared with &gt;8.1 mm (P &lt; .0001) in controls and &gt;8.1 mm in patients with AVS (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the maximal systolic thickness of the indexed basal septum to that of the compacta was ≥0.64/m(2) in patients with LVNC compared to ≤0.62/m(2) in controls and ≤0.96/m(2) in patients with AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maximal systolic compacta thickness &lt;8 mm is specific for LVNC and allows the differentiation of LVNC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts as well as those with myocardial thickening due to AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation may be particularly useful as an additional diagnostic criterion for preventing the overdiagnosis of LVNC </plain></SENT>
