<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Troponin I (TNNI3) is the inhibitory subunit of the thin filament regulatory complex Troponin, which confers calcium-sensitivity to striated muscle actomyosin ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations (2-7%) in this gene had been reported in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of mutations and associated clinical presentation have not been established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients of Indian origin, hence we have undertaken this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have sequenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the exons, including the exon-intron boundaries of TNNI3 gene in 101 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients (HCM), along with 160 healthy controls, inhabited in the same geographical region of southern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study revealed a total of 16 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we have observed Arginine to Glutamine (R to Q) mutation at 3 positions 98, 141 and 162, exclusively in HCM patients with family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The novel R98Q was observed in a severe hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patient (HOCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The R141Q mutation was observed in two familial cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001670'>asymmetric septal hypertrophy</z:hpo> (ASH++) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The R162Q mutation was observed in a ASH++ patient with mean septal thickness of 29 mm, and have also consists of allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> by means of having one more synonymous (E179E) mutation at g.4797: G [RIGHTWARDS ARROW] A: in the same exon 7, which replaces the very frequent codon (GAG: 85%) with rare codon (GAA: 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening for R162Q mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the available family members revealed its presence in 9 individuals, including 7 with allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (R162Q and E179E) of which 4 were severely affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also found 2 novel SNPs, (g.2653; G [RIGHTWARDS ARROW] A and g.4003 C [RIGHTWARDS ARROW] T) exclusively in HCM, and in silico analysis of these SNPs have predicted to cause defect in recognition/binding sites for proteins responsible for proper splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study has provided valuable information regarding the prevalence of TNNI3 mutations in Indian HCM patients and its risk assessment, these will help in genetic counseling and to adopt appropriate treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
