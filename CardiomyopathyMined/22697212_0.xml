<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no consensus exists on the most optimal delivery strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This randomized study was designed to assess cell delivery efficiency of 3 clinical relevant strategies: intracoronary (IC) and transendocardial (TE) using electromechanical mapping guidance (NOGA) compared to surgical delivery in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pig model of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four animals underwent delivery of 10(7) autologous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-oxine labeled bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) 4 weeks after infarction and were randomized to 1 of 3 groups (n=8 each group): IC, TE or surgical delivery (reference group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was defined as percentage (%) of injected dose per organ and assessed by in vivo gamma-emission counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, troponin and coronary flow were assessed before and after MSC injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blinded endpoint analysis showed no significant difference in efficiency after surgical (16±4%), IC (11±1%) and TE (11±3%) (P=0.52) injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IC showed less variability in efficiency compared with TE and surgical injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, TE injection showed less distribution of MSC to visceral organs compared with other modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Troponin rise and intracoronary flow did not differ between the percutaneous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This randomized study showed no significant difference in cell delivery efficiency to the myocardium in a clinically relevant ischemic large animal model between IC and TE delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, no differences in safety profile were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results are important in view of the choice of percutaneous cell delivery modality in future clinical stem cell trials. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd </plain></SENT>
