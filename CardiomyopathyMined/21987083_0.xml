<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003535'>3-methylglutaconic aciduria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is typically caused by mutations in the TAZ (G4.5) gene, which encodes a novel protein family called the tafazzins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of two brothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barth syndrome</z:e> and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) caused by a splice donor mutation in TAZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both had impaired sucking ability at the age of 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elder brother was diagnosed with LVNC at the age of 4 months; by that time he had developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with metabolic decompensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He died at 12 months of age due to intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> despite pharmacological therapy with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>, and a beta-blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the younger brother, who was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barth syndrome</z:e> and LVNC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at the age of 2 months, received early medical treatment and demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical courses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barth syndrome</z:e> observed in our cases show the phonotypic variability of this syndrome and suggest that early therapy may be beneficial for maintaining cardiac function </plain></SENT>
