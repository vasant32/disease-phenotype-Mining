<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> analysis of the systolic (S') and early diastolic (E') velocities in patients (pts.) with non-obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and in top-level athletes in consideration of the previously published cut-off values (S' &lt; 9 cm/s, E' &lt;��9 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pulsed-wave <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> of the systolic and early-diastolic velocities was performed at the lateral and septal mitral annulus in the four-chamber view in 17 HCM pts (12 men; mean age 44 ± 16 years) and 80 consecutive athletes (80 men; mean age 26 ± 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pts with HCM showed significantly decreased systolic velocities of the septal (S' septal: 5.1 ± 1.2 cm/s versus 9.5 ± 1.5 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001) and lateral mitral annulus (S' lateral: 6.4 ± 2.0 cm/s vs. 10.5 ± 2.1 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus E' was significantly decreased in HCM, too (E' septal: 5.9 ± 2.2 cm/s vs. 13.1 ± 2.9 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001; E' lateral: 8.2 ± 3.0 cm/s vs. 16.5 ± 3.4 cm/s, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tissue Doppler Imaging of the systolic and early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus might be helpful as a promising additional method for the echocardiographic differentiation between pathological and physiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
