<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We employed mice lacking TRPV1 [TRPV1((-/-))], db/db diabetic, and control C57BKS/J mice to determine the extent to which TRPV1 channels modulate coronary function and contribute to vascular dysfunction in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
