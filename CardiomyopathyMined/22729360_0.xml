<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest a central role of unbalanced peri-/postpartum <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> that triggers the proteolytic cleavage of the nursing hormone prolactin (PRL) into a potent antiangiogenic, proapoptotic, and proinflammatory 16-kDa PRL fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This notion is supported by the observation that inhibition of PRL secretion by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D2-receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease in an animal model of PPCM and by first clinical experiences where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> seem to exert positive effects with respect to prevention or treatment of PPCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we highlight the current state of knowledge on diagnosis of PPCM, provide insights into the biology and pathophysiology of 16-kDa PRL and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>, and outline potential consequences for the clinical management and treatment options for PPCM patients </plain></SENT>
