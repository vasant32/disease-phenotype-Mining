<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were found to have cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and ultrastructural rearrangement with a tissue-specific reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was hypertrophic cardiomyocyte lengthening that continued after these cells stopped growing thicker, as well as occurred due to the loss of myofibrils, which increased during the cell rearrangement, and directly correlated with the lower ejection fraction and higher end-systolic volume of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
