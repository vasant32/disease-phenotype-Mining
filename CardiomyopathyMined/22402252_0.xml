<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is the initiating factor of cardiac complications especially diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria are susceptible to the damaging effects of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calcium overload and oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the effect of high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in an in vitro setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> condition and the cellular consequences were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and caspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> calcium ([Ca(2+)]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These events led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> exhibited several classical markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, including activation of caspases, appearance of annexin V on the outer plasma membrane, increased population of cells with sub-G(0)/G(1) DNA content and nuclear condensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Key findings include elucidation of cell signaling mechanism of high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induced calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain-1 activation, which triggers non-conventional caspases as alternate mode of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This information increases the understanding of cardiac cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under hyperglycemic condition and can possibly be extended for designing new therapeutic strategies for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel findings of the study reveal that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium </plain></SENT>
