<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Model (SHFM) is 1 of the most widely used tools to predict survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it does not accommodate very elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to assess the applicability of the SHFM in patients &gt;80 years old enrolled in a tertiary care <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the difference between observed survival and mean life expectancy as predicted by the SHFM on 261 patients &gt;80 years old enrolled in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> clinic at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada from January 2002 through March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average age of the patient population was 85 ± 4 years (range 80 to 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of the population consisted of men, 63% had ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM), and average ejection fraction was 36 ± 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median observed survival was 1.91 years (interquartile range 0.68 to 5.53) for the total population (n = 261) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SHFM (predicted median survival 6.7 years, interquartile range 3.8 to 11.2) overestimated life expectancy by an average of 4.79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with ICM (n = 164) versus non-ICM (n = 97), the score overestimated survival by 4.29 versus 5.69 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the SHFM overestimates life expectancy in elderly patients followed in a tertiary care <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to more accurately estimate prognosis in this patient population </plain></SENT>
