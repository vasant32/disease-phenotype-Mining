<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between peak-to-peak (common invasive measurement), peak instantaneous (common Doppler measurement), and mean pressure gradients in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with AS, the peak-to-peak gradient and peak instantaneous gradient are discrepant, and the mean gradient best represents obstruction severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of outflow obstruction differs in HCM, with the maximum gradient occurring in late systole, thus the optimal method for quantifying gradient severity in HCM remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with HCM and 50 patients with AS underwent gradient characterization at cardiac catheterization (age 55 ± 15 years vs. 72 ± 9 years; 48% vs. 42% male, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HCM patients were studied with high-fidelity, micromanometer-tip catheters and transseptal measurement of left ventricular inflow and central aortic pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AS, simultaneous left ventricular and central aortic pressures were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The peak instantaneous gradient was linearly correlated with peak-to-peak gradient in HCM (R(2) = 0.98, p &lt; 0.0001), with the relationship close to the line of identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AS, more scatter and further deviation from the line of identity occurred when comparing the peak instantaneous gradient to the peak-to-peak gradient (R(2) = 0.70, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both peak-to-peak and peak instantaneous gradients were consistently higher than the mean gradient in HCM, with wide 95% confidence limits of agreement (26.7 ± 46.5 mm Hg and 16.4 ± 47.2 mm Hg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, peak instantaneous and peak-to-peak gradient demonstrate excellent correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, both peak instantaneous and peak-to-peak gradients can be used to classify obstruction severity in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the mean gradient should direct clinical management in AS </plain></SENT>
