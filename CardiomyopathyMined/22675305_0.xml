<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that pre-treatment by <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (CoPP) ameliorates both myocardial function and coronary circulation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated hearts from diabetic rats in Langendorff configuration displayed lower left ventricular function and higher coronary resistance (CR) compared to hearts from control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CoPP treatment of diabetic animals (0.3 mg/100 g body weight i.p., once a week for 3 weeks) significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the contractile/relaxation indexes (p &lt; 0.01), while decreasing CR (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CoPP enhanced HO-1 protein levels and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in diabetic animals, as indicated by the significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in heart % GSSG, [Formula: see text] and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CoPP <z:mp ids='MP_0004892'>increased adiponectin levels</z:mp> and phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK and reversed the eNOS/iNOS expression imbalance observed in the untreated diabetic heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after CoPP treatment, a rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> as well as a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi> was observed in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this experimental model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, CoPP treatment improved both cardiac function and coronary flow by blunting <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, restoring eNOS/iNOS expression balance and increasing HO-1 levels, thereby favoring improvement in both endothelial function and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
