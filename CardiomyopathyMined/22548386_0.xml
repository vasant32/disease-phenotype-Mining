<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few treatments for this disease; thus, we analyzed in vitro the possible beneficial effect of adult stem cells in FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, human adipose stem cells from healthy individuals and periodontal ligament cells from FA patients were isolated and cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FA cells are especially vulnerable to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>; thus, they were submitted to this condition and cultured in adipose stem cell-conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in increased cell survival and upregulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative-stress</z:mp>-related genes as well as frataxin, among other genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of trophic factors were shown to be expressed by the adipose stem cells, especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which was also identified in the conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The culture of the ataxic cells under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and in the presence of this trophic factor confirmed its protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this work demonstrates that adipose stem cell-conditioned medium from healthy individuals is capable of changing the transcription levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative-stress</z:mp>-related genes in cells that are particularly susceptible to this condition, avoiding cellular degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, this work shows how neurotrophic factors, particularly BDNF, are capable of increasing cell survival in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, which occurs in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
