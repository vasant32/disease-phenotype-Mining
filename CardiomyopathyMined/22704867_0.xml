<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVNC) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, originally described as an isolated disease without other structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of LVNC among adults with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From our databases we identified adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report frequencies of associated congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> and the prevalence of LVNC among patients with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 202 patients with LVNC, 24 patients (12%; mean age 32Â±11years, 19 males) had additional congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated defects were left ventricular outflow tract abnormalities in 11 patients (46%), including 7 uni- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>; two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctations</z:hpo>; one diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0010541'>aortic hypoplasia</z:mp> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo>, Ebstein anomaly in 6 patients (25%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> in two (8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001719'>double outlet right ventricle</z:hpo> in one patient (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, the prevalence of LVNC was highest among patients with Ebstein anomaly (6/40, 15%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (2/60, 3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (3/129, 2%) and uni- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> (7/963, 1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In adults, various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> are associated with LVNC, particularly stenotic lesions of the left ventricular outflow tract, Ebstein anomaly, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the future, studying these patients in more depth may provide a better understanding of the interplay between genetic and hemodynamic factors that lead to the phenotype of LVNC </plain></SENT>
