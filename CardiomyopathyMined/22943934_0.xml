<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials carried out over the last decade for cardiac regeneration have revealed inadequacy of current approaches in cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chief among them is the choice of stem cells to achieve the desired outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial enthusiasm of adult bone marrow stems cells for myocyte regeneration has largely been relegated to, paracrine driven, donor cell independent, endogenous cardiac repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, true functional restoration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is likely to require considerable myocyte replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to match stem cell application to various clinical scenarios, we review the necessity to pre-prime stem cells towards cardiac fate before myocardial transplantation, and if these differentiated stem cells could confer added advantage over current choice of undifferentiated stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We explore differentiation ability of various stem cells to cardiac progenitors/cardiomyocytes and compare their applicability in providing targeted recovery in light of current clinical challenges of cell therapy </plain></SENT>
