<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> against M(2)R in disease development, we induced an immune response against M(2)R by adoptive transfer into Rag2(-/-) mice of splenocytes from M(2)R(-/-) mice immunized with a recombinant M(2)R protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes transiently infiltrated the heart in recipient mice followed by morphological changes in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mice produced IgG antibodies against M(2)R, which bound to cardiomyocytes in vivo and decreased the amplitude of calcium signals in isolated rat cardiomyocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recipient mice showed <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weights</z:mp> associated with increased intraventricular diameter, decreased systolic function, and increased action potential duration, which are characteristics of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> associated with the presence of anti-M(2)R antibodies are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> with a risk of progressing to the terminal stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our mouse model will be useful in the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of disease progression and the development of new therapies for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
