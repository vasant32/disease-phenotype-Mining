<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three consecutive patients [57 men; mean age 45.8 ± 13.4 (11-74) years] with obstructive HCM underwent TAESM in Fuwai hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical data were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had drug-refractory symptoms and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a resting or physically provoked gradient of ≥50 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative transthoracic, intra-operative transoesophageal and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography was performed to assess LVOT gradients, septal thickness, LVOT diameter, mitral valve function, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic anterior motion (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet had been detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the surgical procedures of the 93 patients were technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average length of postoperative stay was 7.8 ± 3.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day and in-hospital mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial postoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated marked reduction in LVOT gradient (91.76 ± 25.08 to 14.34 ± 13.44 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0005) and significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>; P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concomitant surgical procedures were carried out in 37 (39.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> occurred in 3, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> in 44, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction delay</z:e> in 18, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> in 2, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> in 2 and transient intra-aortic-balloon-pumping was needed in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No other complications were observed during hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 10.72 ± 11.02 (1-24) months, there were no readmissions or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients subjectively reported an obvious decrease in limiting symptoms and a significant increase in physical ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the latest follow-up, the New York Heart Association functional class decreased from 3.09 ± 0.60 (2-4) preoperatively to 1.12 ± 0.32 (1-2) (P &lt; 0.0005); the LVOT gradient remained low at 14.78 ± 14.01 mmHg; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> remained absent (51) or at mild-(41)-to-moderate-(1) levels and <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> resolved completely in 98.9% (92 of 93) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TAESM provides excellent relief from LVOT obstruction in HCM patients, with a conspicuous clinical and echocardiographic outcome at early and mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For obstructive HCM and cardiac comorbidities, concomitant cardiac procedures with TAESM can be performed with low risk and satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
