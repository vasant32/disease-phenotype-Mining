<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether Nkx2.5 protein, a cardiac transcription factor, is regulated by O-GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant Nkx2.5 (myc-Nkx2.5) proteins were reduced by treatment with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitors STZ and O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyroanosylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate; PUGNAC) as well as the overexpression of recombinant O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT-flag) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that myc-Nkx2.5 and OGT-flag proteins interacted and myc-Nkx2.5 proteins were modified by O-GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Nkx2.5 proteins were reduced in the heart tissue of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and O-GlcNAc modification of Nkx2.5 protein increased in diabetic heart tissue compared with non-diabetic heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, excessive O-GlcNAcylation causes downregulation of Nkx2.5, which may be an underlying contributing factor for the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
