<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> is one of the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in Latin American countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its great social impact, there is no direct evidence in the literature explaining the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the main objective of the study was to investigate the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> towards its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase and correlate with modifications in the cellular electrophysiological characteristics of the infected heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, we confirmed and extended previous findings of altered electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed changes in the electrocardiogram were correlated with the prolonged action potential and reduced transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced heart function was associated with remodeling of intracellular calcium handling, altered extracellular matrix content, and to a set of proteins involved in the control of cellular contractility in ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, disruption of calcium homeostasis was partially due to activation of the PI3Kinase/nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we propose a causal link between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> and heart remodeling during chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Altogether our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> may occur due to electrical and mechanical remodeling of cardiac myocytes, and suggest that AKT/PI3K/NO axis could be an important pharmacological target to improve the disease outcome </plain></SENT>
