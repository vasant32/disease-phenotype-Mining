<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T-wave inversion in right precordial leads V(1) to V(3) is a relatively common finding in a 12-lead ECG of children and adolescents and is infrequently found also in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this ECG pattern can also be the first presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and prognostic significance of T-wave inversions in the middle-aged general population are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 12-lead ECGs of 10 899 Finnish middle-aged subjects (52% men, mean age 44 ± 8.5 years) recorded between 1966 and 1972 for the presence of inverted T waves and followed the subjects for 30 ± 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-wave inversions in right precordial leads V(1) to V(3) were present in 54 (0.5%) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 76 (0.7%) of the subjects had inverted T waves present only in leads other than V(1) to V(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right precordial T-wave inversions did not predict increased mortality (not significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> end points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, inverted T waves in leads other than V(1) to V(3) were associated with an increased risk of cardiac and arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T-wave inversions in right precordial leads are relatively rare in the general population, and are not associated with adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased mortality risk associated with inverted T waves in other leads may reflect the presence of an underlying structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
