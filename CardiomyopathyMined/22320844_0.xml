<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that RTN4 is a multifunctional gene, including inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo>, vascular remodeling, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms of RTN4 3'-UTR have been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test whether these two polymorphisms are associated with cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (CSCC), in this research, by using polymerase chain reaction-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, we determined the genotypes of the TATC and CAA polymorphisms in 336 CSCC patients and 450 unrelated control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies of TATC and CAA polymorphisms were not significantly different between CSCC patients and control subjects (odds ratio [OR]=1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.98-1.50 for TATC; OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.76-1.18 for CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased CSCC risk was associated with TATC polymorphism in a recessive model (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.30-0.77), while no significant association was observed between CAA polymorphism and CSCC in different genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of stratified analysis revealed that both TATC and CAA polymorphisms were associated with high clinical stage, and CAA polymorphism was also associated with positive parametrial invasion (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.48-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study provides evidence that TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms are associated with CSCC, indicating that genetic variation in RTN4 3'-UTR contributes to the susceptibility to CSCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to confirm these findings in ethnically different populations and with a larger sample </plain></SENT>
