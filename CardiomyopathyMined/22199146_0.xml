<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Epicardial mapping of the electrophysiological substrate through the coronary vein branches using a 2.2F, 16-pole microelectrode catheter was performed in 33 consecutive patients undergoing VT ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and seven had a non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endocardial ablation was successful in 19 of the 33 patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low-amplitude fractionated diastolic electrograms with an electrogram-QRS interval amounting to 30-70% of the VT cycle length were recorded during the VT in the coronary vein branches in eight patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endocardial ablation failed in seven of the eight patients with diastolic electrograms in the coronary veins, suggesting an epicardial involvement of the VT re-entry circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with a suspected epicardial VT origin, four patients underwent epicardial ablation using a pericardial access after unsuccessful endocardial ablation which eliminated mappable VTs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recording of low-amplitude fractionated diastolic electrograms through the coronary veins facilitates the identification of VTs with an epicardial origin requiring mapping and ablation through a pericardial access </plain></SENT>
