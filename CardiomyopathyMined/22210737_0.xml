<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MINCA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) was registered during a 3-month period in the Stockholm metropolitan area in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MINCA is more common than previously thought (7%) and affecting one third of every woman with MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> were younger and more often presented with signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> such as elevated C-reactive protein and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>Myocarditis</z:mp> constitutes an important differential diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a need for larger studies of MINCA, including investigation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, to establish prevalence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in this important subgroup of MI </plain></SENT>
