<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used phase analysis of gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to evaluate septal activation and LV dyssynchrony in HCM patients pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phase analysis was applied to 28 controls, and 32 HCM patients having rest MPI pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> to assess septal-lateral mechanical activation delay (SLD) and consequent LV dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, phase analysis was applied to another group of 30 patients having serial MPI to measure variability of the LV dyssynchrony parameters on serial studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> significantly reduced SLD and improved LV synchrony in the HCM patients with SLD &lt; 0° due to earlier activation of the lateral wall relative to the septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the measured variability, 12 HCM patients had significant (Z &lt; -1.65, P &lt; 0.05) and 4 had moderate (Z &lt; -1.00, P &lt; 0.15) improvement in LV synchrony post-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLD &lt; 0° predicted improvement in LV synchrony after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SLD and LV dyssynchrony were frequent in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HCM patients, whose septal activation became later than lateral activation, had significant reduction in septal activation delay and improvement in LV synchrony after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
