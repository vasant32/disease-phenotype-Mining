<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that free radicals are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of vitamin E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> induced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty two male Sprague - Dawly rats were involved in this study and were randomly separated into 4 groups, eight rats in each group, one group received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline I.P as control and second group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg I.P, the other two groups also received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg I.P as single dose after seven cumulative doses (for seven days) of vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining for monocytes infiltration and analyses of plasma by (ELISAs) for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1and troponin I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblotting assay for ICAM-1, while left ventricular function was analyzed by microcatheter, also estimated the level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and Catalase) and cardiac enzymes activities (CK-MB and LDH) before starting drugs treatment and after treatment period by 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunofluorescent staining showed that administration of vitamin E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> are attenuated of mononuclear cell infiltration; (p &lt; 0.05 vs. Dox group), also reduced the level of chemokines <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and ICAM-1 expression compared with Dox group only, and there is marked reduction of myocardial troponin-I levels with improved LV function in vitamin E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> treatment increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, LDH, CK-MB levels significantly (P &lt; 0.01), and were counteracted by administration of vitamin E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, but did not significantly affect serum catalase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> effect (Vitamin E and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>) have been shown to decrease doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
