<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we investigated a murine model with conditional cardiac genetic deletion of one desmoplakin allele (DSP ±) and compared the findings to patients with non-diagnostic features of ARVC who carried mutations in desmoplakin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Murine: the DSP (±) mice underwent electrophysiological, echocardiographic, and immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiograms but delayed conduction and inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> associated with mislocalization and reduced intercalated disc expression of Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> current density and myocardial histology were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 2 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human: ten patients with heterozygous mutations in DSP without overt structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (DSP+) and 12 controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were studied by high-density electrophysiological mapping of the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a standard S(1)-S(2) protocol, restitution curves of local conduction and repolarization parameters were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly greater mean increases in delay were identified particularly in the outflow tract vs. controls (P&lt; 0.01) coupled with more uniform wavefront progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds of a segment with a maximal activation-repolarization interval restitution slope &gt;1 was 99% higher (95% CI: 13%; 351%, P = 0.017) in DSP+ vs. controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining revealed Cx43 mislocalization and variable Na channel distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Desmoplakin disease causes connexin mislocalization in the mouse and man preceding any overt histological abnormalities resulting in significant alterations in conduction-repolarization kinetics prior to morphological changes detectable on conventional cardiac imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of desmoplakin is sufficient to cause significant Cx43 mislocalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current density and histological abnormalities may contribute to a worsening phenotype or disease but are not necessary to generate an arrhythmogenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for the earlier diagnosis of ARVC and risk stratification </plain></SENT>
