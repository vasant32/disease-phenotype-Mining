<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the age of 3 years, he underwent muscle biopsy and dystrophin gene analysis owing to an enlarged calf muscle and elevated serum kinase level (6,378 U/L) without overt <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>; based on the results, Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dystrophin gene showed deletion of exons 45 to 49 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He remained ambulant and could step upstairs without significant difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A chest roentgenogram showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> (cardiothoracic ratio, 54%), and his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed abnormal ST-T wave, biatrial enlargement, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-dimensional and M-mode ECGs showed a severely dilated left ventricular cavity with diffuse hypokinesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The systolic indices were reduced, including fractional shortening (9%) and ejection fraction (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite receiving intensive medical treatment, he died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> 5 months after the initial cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report a case of BMD with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated with deletion of exons 45 to 49 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can occur in BMD patients with certain genotypes; therefore, careful follow-up is required even in patients with mild phenotypes of BMD </plain></SENT>
