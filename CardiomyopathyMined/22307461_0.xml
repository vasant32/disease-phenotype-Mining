<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial damage involving cathepsin-D to form a 16 kDa prolactin (PRL) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is pathogenetically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting PRL <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> has yielded promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether microparticles (MPs) can be quantified in serum as markers for diagnosis and treatment effects in PPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with PPCM were compared with age-matched healthy post-partum women (PPCTR), healthy pregnant women (PCTR), healthy non-pregnant women (NPCTR), patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM), patients with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and healthy controls (HCTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> (PPCM-BR) and with PPCM without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>-treatment as control (PPCM-BRCTR) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microparticles were determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial MPs (EMPs) were elevated in PPCM compared with PPCTR, PCTR, and NPCTR, each P&lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were significantly elevated compared with ICM, CAD, and HCTR (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy (PCTR) exhibited only slight increases vs. ICM, CAD, NPCTR, and HCTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in PPCM was due to an increase of activated but not apoptotic EMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Platelet-derived microparticles were highly increased in PPCM compared with ICM (P&lt; 0.001) but 9.3 ± 4.4-fold compared with CAD (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In NPCTR (P&lt; 0.001) compared with NPCTR, the increase was 5.9 ± 1.7-fold (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microparticles generated from monocytes (MMPs) were increased 2.4 ± 1.8-fold in PPCM compared with PCTR (P&lt; 0.001) and 4.8 ± 3.6-fold compared with CAD (P&lt; 0.001), whereas leucocyte MPs (LMPs) were not significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Endothelial microparticles were significantly reduced in PPCM treated additionally with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> compared with PPCM treated only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microparticle profiles may in long-term distinguish PPCM from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and might be a diagnostic marker related to the pathomechanism of PPCM </plain></SENT>
