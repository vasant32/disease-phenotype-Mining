<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac malformations in infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) are five times higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is the most important growth factor in utero and is predominantly bound by IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the echocardiographic findings of neonates of diabetic mothers and the relationship with cord blood IGF-I and IGBP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and methods: This study was conducted on 69 neonates born to diabetic mothers who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, Ain Shams University Hospitals between August 2007 and February 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were classified into three groups: 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, 25 appropriate for gestational age, and 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neonates were subjected to thorough clinical examination and echocardiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and cord blood IGF-I and IGBP-1 were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty neonates (43.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were infants of suboptimally controlled diabetic mothers (HbA1c â‰¥ 7) with positive correlation between HbA1c and interventricular septal (IVS) thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impaired left ventricular contractility was recorded in 52 IDMs (75.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic and laboratory measurements showed significant difference between the three studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac morphological data were negatively correlated to IGFBP-1 and positively correlated to IGF-I and birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The opposing relationships between cord blood IGF-I and IGFBP-1 on the cardiac morphological measurements supporting their putative opposing roles in HCM seen in IDMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Birth weight is the best predictor of hypertrophied IVS especially in infants born to suboptimally controlled diabetic mothers </plain></SENT>
