<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, asymptomatic mothers with primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency were identified by low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels in their infant by newborn screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluate mutations in the SLC22A5 gene and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transport in fibroblasts from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">Carnitine</z:chebi> transport was significantly reduced in fibroblasts obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency, but was significantly higher in the asymptomatic women's than in the symptomatic patients' fibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, ergothioneine transport (a selective substrate of the OCTN1 transporter, tested here as a control) was similar in cells from controls and patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing indicated an increased frequency of nonsense mutations in symptomatic patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the missense mutations in Chinese hamster ovary (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) cells indicated that many mutations retained residual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transport activity, with no difference in the average activity of missense mutations identified in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cells from asymptomatic women have on average higher levels of residual <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transport activity as compared to that of symptomatic patients due to the presence of at least one missense mutation </plain></SENT>
