<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We and others have shown previously that left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve assessed quantitatively by high-dose dobutamine stress-echocardiography (DSE) has prognostic implications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve by differently skilled operators in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-dose DSE was performed in 63 consecutive patients, mean age 50 ± 10 years and ejection fraction (EF) 19 ± 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVEF was calculated 1) using Simpson's biplane formula, and 2) semi-quantitatively (5% increments) by novice and experienced echocardiographers, and by a DSE expert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to have preserved LV contractile reserve if LVEF dobutamine-induced change was ≥5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven (45.8%) patients died during the 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of the assessment was 89%, 94%, and 98% for novice and experienced readers and DSE expert, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that LV contractile reserve assessed semi-quantitatively by DSE expert and experienced reader achieved the best prognostic separation (log rank 19.63 and 18.99, respectively, p &lt; 0.001 for both), followed by quantitative assessment (log rank 9.76, p = 0.0018) and assessment by novice reader (log rank 8.76, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Areas under the curves were similar for quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve is feasible by differently skilled operators </plain></SENT>
