<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the identification of several immune regulatory abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> increasing attention has been focused on autoimmune mechanisms as potential key elements in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> has appeared to be often related to elevated levels of autoantibodies against cardiac structural or functional proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among several autoantibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>) which react against cardiac cellular proteins that have been detected in sera from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients, those against β1-adrenoreceptors (β1-ARs) appeared particularly relevant from a pathophysiological point of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available experimental and clinical data suggest that in β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi>-positive patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> might be a β1-AR-targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the present knowledge about β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>, their role in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> etiopathogenesis and the therapeutic benefits of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Special attention is focused on the possible origin of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi>, their interaction with the β₁-ARs, the prevalence of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and the potential pathophysiologic impact of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> in the development and progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attention is also given to the amelioration of β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> cardiotoxicity by β₁-AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and especially to immunoadsorption (IA) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responsiveness to IA therapy and its long-term efficiency, as well as post-IA reappearance of β₁-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> and its impact on patients' outcome are also discussed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally the important question of whether the therapeutic results of IA are indeed related to β₁-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AAB</z:chebi> removal is analyzed on the basis of available data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall the review aims to provide an exhaustive overview of the available experimental and clinical data on β₁-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="233869">AABs</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and also a theoretical and practical basis for clinicians who are or intend in future to be engaged in this field </plain></SENT>
