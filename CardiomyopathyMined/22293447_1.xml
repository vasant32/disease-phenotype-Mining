<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cine, black-blood T2-weighted and LGE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were acquired in 23 patients with TC within 72 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wall motion abnormality (WMA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and LGE were evaluated with a 16-segment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SI characteristics of LGE were analyzed using SI distribution in remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> segments as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI was performed 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of LGE MRI was also performed in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) to compare the SI characteristics between TC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, WMA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were observed in 236 (64%) and 205 (56%) of 368 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LGE was observed in 10 (2.7%) of 368 segments and in 5 (22%) of 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> LGE lesions in TC exhibited transmural enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) in TC was significantly lower than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (3.1±0.3 standard deviations (SD) vs. 6.1±1.2 SD, P&lt;0.01), and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> value of 4 was useful for distinguishing TC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both LGE and WMA disappeared within 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Grey myocardial signal on LGE MRI may be observed in patients with TC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of LGE is substantially less than that of WMA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and disappears within 12 months </plain></SENT>
