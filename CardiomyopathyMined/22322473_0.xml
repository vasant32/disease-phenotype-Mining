<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TTC Tuscany Registry is an observational prospective multicenter registry established to define the prevalence, epidemiology and prognosis of TTC in the Tuscany area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1 to December 31, 2009, 105 consecutive patients hospitalized in the 14 Cardiology Units of the Tuscany Region with a diagnosis of TTC, were enrolled in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TTC diagnosis was made using the Mayo Clinic modified criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical, instrumental, laboratory and 6-month follow-up data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTC represented 1.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> in the Tuscany Region during 2009, and it was diagnosed in 0.6% of the angiographic exams performed during the same year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data collected showed that TTC affects mainly the female gender (91%) in the post-menopausal period (70 ± 11 years), though 5% of patients were ≤50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An antecedent stressful event was frequently detected (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (86%), associated with ST-segment elevation (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean left ventricular ejection fraction on admission was 40 ± 9%, and was associated with apical (37%), midapical (49%) or midventricular (5%) wall motion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction recovered to 51 ± 9% in 7 ± 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was the most common complication in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (14%), and 4 patients presented with cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient died during the index hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 6-month follow-up, no patient had TTC recurrence, 9 patients were rehospitalized (7 for noncardiac disease) and 2 patients died of noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data, which represent the largest prospective series of patients with a diagnosis of TTC, show that the prevalence of TTC in Tuscany is similar that described in other national and international studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the data highlight that TTC may occur also in male patients and in patients aged &lt;50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mid-term prognosis is good, but the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> cannot be neglected </plain></SENT>
