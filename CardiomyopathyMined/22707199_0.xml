<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients continue to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cardiovascular complication even after achieving glycemic control, suggesting a "metabolic memory" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic memory is a major challenge in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complication</z:e>, and the mechanisms underlying metabolic memory are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest a link between chromatin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation and metabolic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> 3 lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3), a key epigenetic chromatin marker, was involved in high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HG)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and metabolic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubating cardiomyocyte cells in HG resulted in increased levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA when compared with myocytes incubated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> culture media, whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (osmotic control) has no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that H3K9me3 levels were significantly decreased at the promoters of IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting demonstrated that protein levels of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase, Suv39h1, were also reduced after HG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HG-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome-c</z:chebi> release were reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of HG on the expression of IL-6 and the levels of H3K9me3 were irreversible after the removal of HG from the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HG-induced sustained inflammatory phenotype and epigenetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification, rather than HG-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, are main mechanisms responsible for metabolic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that HG increases expression of inflammatory cytokine and decreases the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-3 methylation at the cytokine promoter, and suggest that modulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> 3 methylation and inflammatory cytokine expression may be a useful strategy to prevent metabolic memory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
