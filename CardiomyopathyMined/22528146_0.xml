<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The male infant presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> requiring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature delivery</z:hpo> at 32 weeks and was noted to have dysmorphic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> following birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An echocardiogram revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infant's cardiac lesion rapidly progressed, and he was discharged home for palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical testing of genes causative of Noonan syndrome and related disorders detected the previously reported, pathogenic, de novo SHOC2 missense mutation predicting p.Ser2Gly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's cardiac findings and features were not typical for those individuals previously reported with this SHOC2 mutation and thus expand the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
