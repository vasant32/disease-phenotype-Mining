<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both adipokines have been implicated in immunomodulation and cardiac remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed for the first time a clinical study to elucidate the effects of leptin and resistin on progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in patients with non-ischaemic dilated (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and inflammatory (DCMi) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For the clinical study 120 patients were divided into a control (n = 16), <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (n = 52), and DCMi (n = 52) group to determine the effect of leptin and resistin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression following adipokine exposition were determined in vitro in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin and resistin systemic plasma levels and not cardiac expression were significantly elevated in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (leptin, 13.12 ± 17.2 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05; resistin, 6.87 ± 2.25 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05) and DCMi (leptin, 13.63 ± 16 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05; resistin, 7.27 ± 2.2 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group (leptin, 7.34 ± 5.7 ng/mL; resistin, 4.4 ± 1.18 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate linear regression model revealed low leptin and resistin plasma levels as contributors for favourable cardiac functional parameters at 6-month follow-up independent of inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell culture experiments in vitro showed leptin and resistin to be potent regulators of TNF-α and IL-6 expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to significantly increased redox stress in cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High leptin and resistin expression in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and DCMi is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> progression, i.e. severe cardiac dysfunction, independent of immune responses </plain></SENT>
