<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the prognostic relevance of serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) levels in nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICMP) and assessed whether increased levels relate to the degree of functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (FMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients with NICMP were enrolled and followed-up for 10 ± 2 months in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic analysis established a cutoff CA125 value of 25 U/mL for predicting mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to their CA125 levels (CA125 &lt;25 U/mL [n=58] and CA125 ≥ 25 U/mL [n=19]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high CA125 values had statistically worse functional status, higher B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) levels, higher left ventricular volumes, lower ejection fraction, higher E/Em ratio, higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and more severe FMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the multivariate analysis, serum CA125 (P=.002) and severe FMR (P=.04) were identified as the independent predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum CA125 levels also correlated with BNP levels and FMR severity (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum CA125 is a powerful prognostic biomarker that is associated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, serum BNP levels and several echocardiographic parameters including left ventricular volumes, systolic and diastolic functions, pulmonary artery pressure, and the degree of FMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum CA125 was also shown as an independent predictor of mortality during 10 ± 2 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
