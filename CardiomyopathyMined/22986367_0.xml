<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the physiological function of Sirt1 deficiency in the postnatal development of the heart remains to be characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the relevance of Sirt1 in the development and function of the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearts from Sirt1-deficient mice partially or totally lacking Sirt1 protein activity were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of Sirt1 activity led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in adult hearts, a phenotype accompanied by reduced cardiomyocyte size and the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphological and functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> abnormalities were observed in the adult hearts lacking Sirt1, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction contributes to the progression of the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gene expression analyses revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genes were the most affected in Sirt1-deficient mice, showing a reduction in their expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No overt cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was observed in neonates lacking Sirt1 activity, but first signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> alterations were already present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analyses revealed that Sirt1 is highly expressed in the heart after birth, indicating the importance of Sirt1 in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, Sirt1 deficiency affected the acetylation pattern of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) transcription factors, which are critical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart development and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings indicate that Sirt1 is essential for the maintenance of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postnatal myocardium development </plain></SENT>
