<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and biophysical consequences of the R222Q mutation in the voltage sensor of cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Comprehensive clinical assessment, invasive electrophysiologic study, genetic analysis, and patch-clamp studies were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uniquely, 5 members had the same electrocardiographic pattern of a junctional escape ventricular capture bigeminy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of 3 family members revealed the same mutation (R222Q) in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel gene, SCN5A (nucleotide change was 665 Gâ†’A that led to missense amino acid substitution Arg 222 Gln, located in the S4 voltage sensor in domain I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Catheterization and mapping revealed that there was no consistent evidence of bundle branch reentry or fascicular potentials preceding ectopic beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bigeminy was suppressed by the intravenous administration of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp studies revealed unique differential leftward voltage-dependent shifts in activation and inactivation properties of human voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels with the R222Q mutation, consistent with increasing channel excitability at precisely the voltages corresponding to the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The R222Q mutation enhances cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel excitability, resulting in an unusual, highly penetrant phenotype of escape capture bigeminy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the conclusion that a mutation in the voltage sensor of cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels can cause bigeminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
