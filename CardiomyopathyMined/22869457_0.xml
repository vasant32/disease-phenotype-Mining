<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prevalence, genetic background, and impact in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) are unknown and were therefore investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 445 patients with HCM, 195 had a coronary angiography and 124 a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT draining into the ventricular cavities was observed in 5 of 195 HCM patients (2.5%), whereas it was detected in 0.1% of 1000 consecutive subjects without congenital anomalies undergoing coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with CT-HCM underwent a total body computed tomography scan to investigate the presence of systemic vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HCM-related MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TPM1 genes and hereditary haemorragic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>-related endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 genes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology, clinical profile, and outcome of CT-HCM patients were correlated with those of 22 control HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mucocutaneous or systemic vascular malformations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene analysis showed a MYH7 mutation in two patients, with an associated endoglin point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histology showed in the CT-HCM cohort a more pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> (29.8 ± 3.8%) compared with HCM controls (13 ± 2.6%), and disorganized cardiomyocytes separated by thin-walled large vessels adherent to the endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the CT-HCM cohort had a higher arrhythmic profile at diagnosis and increased incidence of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantations and arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT is detectable in 2.5% of HCM patients vs. 0.1% of the general population; it may derive from a co-existing endoglin gene mutation and cause a prominent, potentially arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
