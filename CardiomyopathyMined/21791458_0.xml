<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of structural cardiac lesions using echocardiography in apparently healthy boys referred for pre-participation screening (PPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 3100 male soccer players were evaluated by echocardiography in addition to the standard PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 56 subjects (1.8%), a structural cardiac lesion with potential future complication was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) was found in two boys; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) in 24; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in 10 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e>) in 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting physical examination (PE) failed to identify any abnormalities in the majority of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the boys presented an uncomplicated echocardiography, except two boys with HCM, one with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and one with a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic young athletes may have a structural cardiac alteration with the potential of present or future haemodynamic and arrhythmic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A majority of mild cardiac lesions are difficult to diagnose or suspect by the current screening based on medical history, PE and ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography significantly improves the diagnostic power of screening in the detection of both mild and serious cardiac conditions in the athletic population </plain></SENT>
