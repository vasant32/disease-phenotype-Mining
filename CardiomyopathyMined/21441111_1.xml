<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alpk3 (-/-) mice were produced according to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Mendelian ratios and appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that had features of both hypertrophic and dilated forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>Cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> in Alpk3 (-/-) mice was characterized by increased thickness of both left and right ventricular (LV and RV) walls and by markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weight</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weight</z:mp>/body weight and heart weight/tibia length ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging studies confirmed the increased thickness in both septal and LV free walls at end-diastole, although there was no significant change in LV wall thickness at end-systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>Myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> was the predominant feature in Alpk3 (-/-) mice, but several changes more typically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> included a marked increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volume, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003393'>reduced cardiac output</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and ejection fractions, suggesting LV chamber dilation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were notably absent in Alpk3 (-/-) mice; however, light and electron microscopy revealed altered cardiomyocyte architecture, characterized by reduced numbers of abnormal intercalated discs being associated with mild disarray of myofibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These lesions could account for the impaired contractility of the myofibrillar apparatus and contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in Alpk3 (-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
