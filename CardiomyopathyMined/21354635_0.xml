<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty subjects (10 consecutive HCM-subjects (8-males, mean 63.4-years), 10 healthy controls (5-males, mean 51.5-years)) underwent speckle-tracking TTE (iE-33), and analysis of regional peak-longitudinal (LS) and radial-strain (RS), and corresponding strain rates in each of 17 LVM segments (American-Heart-Association classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In HCM-subjects, fibrotic lesions were identified by early-phase defective enhancement and late-phase abnormal enhancement by CT (Light-Speed-Ultra-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional peak LS and RS at basal, mid and apical levels were measured in MSCT-detected fibrotic and non-fibrotic LVM lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 HCM subjects, 143 lesions (84.1%) yielded good tracking on TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty lesions showed fibrotic changes in 5 subjects by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional peak-LS and RS absolute values were significantly lower in both fibrotic and non-fibrotic lesions in HCM subjects than in controls at basal, mid, apical levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While peak-LS (%) absolute values were significantly lower in fibrotic than non-fibrotic lesions at basal, mid and apical levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05), regional peak-RS absolute values were significantly lower only at mid levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LS was a more sensitive indicator than the corresponding rate, with better reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, regional peak-LS was significantly lower in fibrotic than non-fibrotic lesions in LVM by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regional peak-LS by speckle-tracking provides useful information noninvasively to distinguish fibrotic from non-fibrotic lesions in LVM in HCM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVM in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
