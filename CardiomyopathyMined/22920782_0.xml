<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gradient triggers <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> possibly through a phase 2 reentrant mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Brugada electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern, which can be dynamic and is sometimes concealed, being only recorded in upper precordial leads, is the hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of limitations of previous consensus documents describing the Brugada ECG pattern, especially in relation to the differences between types 2 and 3, a new consensus report to establish a set of new ECG criteria with higher accuracy has been considered necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the new ECG criteria, only 2 ECG patterns are considered: pattern 1 identical to classic type 1 of other consensus (coved pattern) and pattern 2 that joins patterns 2 and 3 of previous consensus (<z:mp ids='MP_0000162'>saddle-back</z:mp> pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This consensus document describes the most important characteristics of 2 patterns and also the key points of differential diagnosis with different conditions that lead to Brugada-like pattern in the right precordial leads, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle-branch block</z:hpo>, athletes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also discussed is the concept of Brugada phenocopies that are ECG patterns characteristic of Brugada pattern that may appear and disappear in relation with multiple causes but are not related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
