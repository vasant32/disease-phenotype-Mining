<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether or not there are differences in the characteristics of TC between Japan and USA remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Data for patients who had undergone urgent left heart catheterization for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome were retrospectively retrieved from Keio University School of Medicine (KUSM) database in Japan and Lahey Clinic Medical Center (LCMC) database in USA between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 626 coronary angiographies were performed in KUSM and 1,880 coronary angiographies were performed in LCMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients in Japan and 34 patients in USA met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of patients in Japan was 75 years where 92% were women, compared to 67 years and 94% women in USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were similar between Japan and USA, there was a trend towards fewer patients in Japan displaying a history of coronary revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) was present in 21% of USA patients, whereas no patients were present in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the incidence of readmission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and TC recurrence during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with TC in Japan have fewer prior overt CAD and fewer family history of premature CAD, but no significant differences were found in the long-term prognosis and the recurrence rate between patients in Japan and USA </plain></SENT>
