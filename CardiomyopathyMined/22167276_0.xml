<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died of cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and renal involvement (either clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> or CKD stage &gt;1) were also negatively associated with survival when analysed as single factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this small study, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> at baseline did not significantly predict cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant effect of elevated arterial stiffness, especially in a small cohort, argues for its clinical utility in individual patient risk assessment and for further intervention studies focusing on therapeutic reduction </plain></SENT>
