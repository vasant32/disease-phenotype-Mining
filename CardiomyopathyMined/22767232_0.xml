<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>α-Actinin2 (Actn2) is a predominant protein in the sarcomere Z disc whose mutation can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the function of Actn2 in Z-disc assembly and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in vertebrates remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We leveraged genetic tools in zebrafish embryos to elucidate the function of Actn2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified a single Actn2 homologue expressed in the zebrafish heart and conducted loss-of-function studies by antisense morpholino technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although zebrafish Actn2 assembles early into the Z disc, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of actn2 did not affect the early steps of sarcomere assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, Actn2 is required for Z bodies to register laterally, forming well-aligned Z discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presumably as a consequence to this structural defect in the sarcomere, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of Actn2 resulted in reduced cardiac function, primarily characterized as a reduced end-diastolic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of actn2 also significantly reduced the ventricle chamber size, due to both reduced cardiomyocyte (CM) size and CM number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, reduced CM size can be rescued by the cessation of heart contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genetic studies of zebrafish uncovered a function for actn2 in lateral registration of Z body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In actn2 morphant fish, the Z-disc defect sequentially affects cardiac function, which leads to morphological changes in the ventricle through a mechanical force-dependent mechanism.-Yang, J., Xu, X. α-Actinin2 is required for the lateral alignment of Z discs and ventricular chamber enlargement during zebrafish cardiogenesis </plain></SENT>
