<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbation of ER-associated functions results in an evolutionarily conserved cell stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is also called ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ER stress is aimed initially at compensating for damage but can eventually trigger cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> if ER stress is excessive or prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Now the ER stress has been associated with numerous diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For instance, our recent studies have demonstrated the important role of ER stress in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced cardiac cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is known that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has been considered to play a critical role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this paper will summarize the information from the literature and our own studies to focus on the pathological role of ER stress in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UPR activation and ER-initiated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> will provide us with new targets for drug discovery and therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
