<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, restrictions on certain types of physical activity that were intended to preserve cardiac function have been recommended, based on a mixture of evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the LIFE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Survivorship &amp; Transition Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, the authors reevaluated their recommendations for exercise in survivors who were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, with or without irradiation in proximity to the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary goal was to develop consistent, specific, practical, safe, and (where possible) evidence-based recommendations for at-risk survivors in the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, the authors referred to current exercise guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors, consulted recent literature for relevant populations, and obtained input from the program's pediatric cardiology consultant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting risk-based exercise recommendations are designed to complement current published guidelines, maximize safe exercise, and help <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life that emphasizes overall wellness and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article describes a single institution's experience in modifying exercise recommendations for at-risk childhood survivors and includes the methods, findings, and current institutional practice recommendations along with sample education materials </plain></SENT>
