<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the 1990s, many countries in Europe and the United States have enacted genetic non-discrimination legislation to prevent people from deferring genetic tests for fear that insurers or employers would discriminate against them based on that information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although evidence for genetic discrimination exists, little is known about the origins and backgrounds of fears of discrimination and how it affects decisions for uptake of genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to gain a better understanding of these fears and its possible impact on the uptake of testing by studying the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a qualitative study, we followed six Dutch extended families involved in genetic testing for HCM for three-and-a-half years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 members of these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the narratives of the families, we suggest that fears of discrimination have to be situated in the broader social and life-course context of family and kin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe the processes in which families developed meaningful interpretations of genetic discrimination and how these interpretations affected family members' decisions to undergo genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that fears of genetic discrimination do not so much stem from the opportunity of genetic testing but much more from earlier experiences of discrimination of diseased family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results help identify the possible limitations of genetic non-discrimination regulations and provide direction to clinicians supporting their clients as they confront issues of genetic testing and genetic discrimination </plain></SENT>
