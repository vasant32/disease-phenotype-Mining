<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alström Syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e>) is an extremely rare multiorgan disease caused by mutations in ALMS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) is a common finding but only one series has been investigated by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight genetically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> patients (ages 11-41) underwent CMR performed by standard cine steady state, T1, T2 and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction (EF), Diastolic Volume (EDV) and Systolic Volume normalized for body surface area (ESV), and mass indices were determined, as well as EDV/Mass ratio, an index expressing the adequacy of cardiac mass to heart volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was assessed by LGE; diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was measured by a TI scout sequence acquired at 5, 10 and 15min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> by comparing inversion time values (TI) at null time in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one patient severe <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was present with diffuse LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were seven cases without clinical <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, EF was at lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits or slightly reduced and ESV index increased; six patients had decreased mass index and EDV/Mass ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild regional non ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was detected by LGE in three cases; diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, as demonstrated by shorter TI values in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> in comparison with controls (5min: 152±12 vs 186±16, p 0.0002; 10min: 175±8 vs 204±18, p 0.0012; 15min: 193±9 vs 224±16, p 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e> is characterized by progressive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, associated with systolic dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> and reduced myocardial mass </plain></SENT>
