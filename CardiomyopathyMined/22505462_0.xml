<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have examined diagnostic yield of these clinics but outcome of clinical management has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational outcome study of consecutively referred relatives of SUD victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 193 individuals (108 families) referred to a regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> clinic following SUD/aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> of a young relative (mean follow-up 16.5 months, range 0.1-61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent assessment by history, examination, ECG and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exercise electrocardiography, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> provocation, further imaging techniques and genetic testing were performed in selected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) insertion based on national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Forty-five patients (23%) from 38 families (35%) were diagnosed with an inheritable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen had potentially prognostically important medication commenced and 4 had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> inserted on clinic recommendation (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two other individuals had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> removed after negative testing for familial RYR2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have occurred during follow-up to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of an inheritable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was obtained in a significant minority of those with a family history of SUD/aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> inserted as a result of specialist assessment was very small (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A major function of the clinic is reassurance of the clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cessation of treatment after exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> by genetic testing </plain></SENT>
