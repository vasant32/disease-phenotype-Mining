<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the length of time required for recovery of LV systolic function (LVSF) in patients with PPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two consecutive women with PPCM were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimum required time of follow-up for inclusion was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography, and plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) and C-reactive protein measurement at admission, and every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early recovery was defined as normalization of LVSF at 6 months post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed recovery was defined if the length of time required for recovery of LVSF was longer than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent left ventricular dysfunction (PLVD) was defined as an ejection fraction of &lt;50% at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (47.6%) recovered completely, 10 died (23.8%), and 12 (28.6%) had PLVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average time to complete recovery was 19.3 months after initial diagnosis (3-42 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recovery was observed only in six patients (30%), whereas delayed recovery was observed in 14 out of 20 patients (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete recovery were more likely to have a higher LV ejection fraction and smaller LV end-systolic dimensions at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Full recovery of LVSF in PPCM patients often requires longer than 6 months </plain></SENT>
