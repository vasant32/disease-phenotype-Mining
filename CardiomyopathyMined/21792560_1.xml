<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, treatment and follow-up data from 2,023 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to ischaemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> enrolled between 1995 and 2005 (996 patients treated at a secondary hospital vs. 1,027 patients treated at a tertiary hospital) were prospectively compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients treated at the secondary hospital setting were twice as likely to have ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> compared to the tertiary hospital setting as the underlying cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (59.7% vs. 33.0%, respectively) and were almost a decade older (mean age 65.2 vs. 56.7 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of guideline-recommended therapy increased in both centres over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In direct temporal comparison, both guideline-adherent pharmacological therapy and device therapy were implemented earlier at the tertiary hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were significantly lower among patients treated at the secondary hospital (log-rank test P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and heart transplantation, however, was not significantly different after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics (P = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the marked disparity between the patient cohorts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> presenting at secondary and tertiary hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though patient characteristics-particularly age, aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and the time of implementation of pharmacological and device treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-differed significantly, after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, no substantial difference in the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and HTX was found during the 5-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
