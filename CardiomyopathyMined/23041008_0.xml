<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Homozygous mutations in ANO5, a gene encoding anoctamin 5, a putative calcium-activated <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> channel, have recently been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> or isolated high-CK levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has not previously been reported in these populations despite a proven expression of anoctamin 5 in the cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting for the management of high-CK levels or overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> with proven ANO5 mutations were prospectively investigated between June 2010 and March 2012 in Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, according to a standardised protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological and cardiological clinical examinations, CK assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiography were performed, as well as cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study included 19 consecutive patients (male=15, age=46.2±12.7years) from 16 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five had asymptomatic high-CK levels and 14 had overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a personal history of stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECG showed <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography displayed LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in two patients, LV dysfunction in one, and both abnormalities in two who fulfilled criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> which was confirmed by cardiac MRI and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a potential complication in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> due to mutations in the ANO5 gene whose screening requires specific procedures </plain></SENT>
