<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and its associated complications have come to represent a major public health concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a complex disease characterized by multiple metabolic derangements and is known to impair cardiac function by disrupting the balance between pro-oxidants and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are hallmarks of the molecular mechanisms responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among several <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated mechanisms that have been proposed, ROS-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> has received the most attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROS have been shown to interact with proteins, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, and DNA, causing damage to the cellular macromolecules and subsequently, deterioration of cellular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-1 (Trx1) gene expression has been demonstrated to protect the diabetic myocardium from dysfunction by reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and enhancing the expression of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The failure of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> to consistently demonstrate clinical benefit necessitates further investigation of the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
