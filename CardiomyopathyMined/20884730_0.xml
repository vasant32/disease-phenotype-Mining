<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stress-induced or tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac syndrome characterized by transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction of uncertain cause and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to assess the long-term outcome of patients with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred sixteen consecutive patients were prospectively included in the study and observed at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, TTC recurrence, and hospitalization from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean initial LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at admission was 36% ± 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who were discharged alive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one showed complete LV functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (2.0 ± 1.3 years), only 64 (55%) patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rehospitalization rate was high (25%), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (n = 6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (n = 5) as the most common causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients had a recurrence of TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died (seven from cardiovascular cause) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality (12% vs 7%; P = .284) and in the other clinical events between patients with and without severe LV dysfunction at presentation (LVEF ≤ 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality observed in patients with TTC was compared with age and sex-specific mortality of the general population using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The SMR was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.83-6.34) in the TTC population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at Cox analysis was Charlson comorbidity index (hazard ratio, 1.786; P = .0001), but the degree of initial LV dysfunction was not an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence of TTC is rare, but recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> are common in patients with TTC and frequently lead to hospital readmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term mortality is higher as compared with the control general population and at least in part related to patients' comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Initial LV dysfunction severity does not seem to impact long-term event rates </plain></SENT>
