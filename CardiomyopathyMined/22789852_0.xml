<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many cases, biological effects of the mutations are well-documented, whereas their structural and mechanical impact on filament assembly and regulatory function is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate molecular defects leading to cardiac dysfunction, we have examined the structural mechanics of two tropomyosin mutants, E180G and D175N, which are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tropomyosin is an Î±-helical coiled-coil dimer which polymerizes end-to-end to create an elongated superhelix that wraps around F-actin filaments of muscle and non-muscle cells, thus modulating the binding of other actin-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we study how flexibility changes in the E180G and D175N mutants might affect tropomyosin binding and regulatory motion on F-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy and Molecular Dynamics simulations show that E180G and D175N mutations cause an increase in bending flexibility of tropomyosin both locally and globally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This excess flexibility is likely to increase accessibility of the myosin-binding sites on F-actin, thus destabilizing the low-Ca(2+) relaxed-state of cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting imbalance in the on-off switching mechanism of the mutants will shift the regulatory equilibrium towards Ca(2+)-activation of cardiac muscle, as is observed in affected muscle, accompanied by enhanced systolic activity, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac compensations associated with HCM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
