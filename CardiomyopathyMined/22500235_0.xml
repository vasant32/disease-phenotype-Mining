<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with permanent pacing in three patients with relapse of both LVG and symptoms 7 to 12 months after successful <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even though pressure gradient recurrence was observed at midventricular level, we were able to achieve symptomatic improvement and LVG reduction after right ventricular apex pacing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect on symptoms was long lasting-the 6-month followup echo-stress tests confirmed good exercise capacity and lack of provocable LVG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found pacing to be a safe and effective treatment option in this clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on our overall observations, we propose pacing as a niche treatment for patients with recurrence of LVG at midventricular level after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
