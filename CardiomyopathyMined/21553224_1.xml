<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Published data on the association between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e>) risk are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 case-control studies including 2642 cases and 3136 controls provided data on the association between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, no significantly elevated risk was associated with Arg389Gly polymorphisms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no statistically increased risk was found for Gly389Gly versus Arg389Arg (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54-0.99; Ph=0.35) and Gly389Gly versus Arg389Arg+Arg389Gly (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.55-1.01; Ph=0.52) among Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, significantly increased risk was found among Asians based on the relatively small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> risk was associated with Ser49Gly polymorphisms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stratified by ethnicity, statistical association was found among Asians for Gly49Gly versus Ser49Ser (OR 4.56; 95% CI 1.36-15.23; Ph=0.10) and Gly49Gly versus Ser49Ser+Ser49Gly (OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.33-15.15; Ph=0.12), but not among Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that no statistically increased risk was found between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> among Europeans </plain></SENT>
