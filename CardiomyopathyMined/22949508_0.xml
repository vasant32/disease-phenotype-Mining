<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms that allow tissues and organs to cope with such stresses are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that caspase-3 knock-out mice or caspase inhibitor-treated mice were defective in activating the anti-apoptotic Akt kinase in response to various chemical and environmental stresses causing sunburns, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defective Akt activation in caspase-3 knock-out mice was accompanied by increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and impaired survival in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice homozygous for a mutation in RasGAP that prevents its cleavage by caspase-3 exhibited a similar defect in Akt activation, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in stressed organs, marked deterioration of their physiological functions, and stronger disease development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence for the relevance of caspase-3 as a stress intensity sensor that controls cell fate by either initiating a RasGAP cleavage-dependent cell resistance program or a cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
