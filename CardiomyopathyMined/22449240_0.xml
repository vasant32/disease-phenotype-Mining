<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart transplantation or combined liver-heart transplantation are the most successful options, although results rely on underline mechanism and systemic nature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present the first case of a Caucasian patient with the p.Val122Ile mutated TTR-related cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> treated with heart transplantation due to this gene mutation frequent in Afro-Americans with a prevalent isolated heart involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The choice of isolated heart transplantation instead of combined heart and liver transplantations was based on (1) severe and progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, (2) evidence of a gene mutation generally associated with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and (3) absence of relevant extra-cardiac involvement (with the possible exception of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In any case, the very short post-transplant observation period of 10 months does not allow any conclusions on the long-term course of the presented strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is the first European Caucasian family with the p.Val122Ile TTR mutation that has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Till now, very few Caucasian cases of p.Val122Ile mutated TTR-related cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient and some members of his family also had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> suggesting a regional phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of European Caucasian TTR p.Val122Ile </plain></SENT>
