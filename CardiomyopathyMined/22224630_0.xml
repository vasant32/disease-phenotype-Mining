<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations identified in LMNA encoding lamin A/C belong to the most frequently described causes for inherited forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the clinical characteristics of LMNA mutation carriers we performed genetic analysis of LMNA in 20 unrelated patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and cardiac conduction disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six small nuclear families heterozygous mutations in LMNA were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two missense mutations led to the substitution of highly conserved amino acid residues within the rod domain of lamin A/C and four not-yet-described nonsense mutations cause the formation of predicted truncated lamin A/C missing parts of the tail domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was the most prominent clinical characteristic of the affected family members with a high degree of involvement of conduction system defects and less often accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiac phenotype of the affected family members was severe and progressive with age, indicating the necessity for a genetic testing for LMNA mutations in patients with familial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
