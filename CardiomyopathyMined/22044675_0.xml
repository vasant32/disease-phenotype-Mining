<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TC) usually is not recognized until heart catheterization reveals typical wall motion abnormalities in the absence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was our aim to identify TC by its unique cardiac biomarker profile at an early stage and, preferably, with non-invasive procedures only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ratios of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi>, NT-proBNP and troponin T (TnT), NT-proBNP and creatinekinase-MB (CK-MB) were compared in patients with TC (n=39), patients with ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, n=48) and patients with non-ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (NSTEMI, n=34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers were recorded serially at admission and at the three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal cut-off values to distinguish TC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and NSTEMI were calculated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At admission a NT-proBNP (ng/l)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> (μg/l) ratio of 3.8, distinguished TC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> (sensitivity: 89%, specificity: 90%), while a NT-proBNP (ng/l)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi> (μg/l) ratio of 14 separated well between TC and NSTEMI (sensitivity: 65%, specificity: 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Best differentiation of TC and ACS was possible with the ratio of peak levels of NT-proBNP (ng/l)/TnT (μg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cut-off value of NT-proBNP (ng/l)/TnT (μg/l) ratio of 2889, distinguished TC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> (sensitivity: 91%, specificity: 95%), while a NT-proBNP (ng/l)/TnT (μg/l) ratio of 5000 separated well between TC and NSTEMI (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TC goes along with a singular cardiac biomarker profile, which might be useful to identify patients with TC among patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) </plain></SENT>
