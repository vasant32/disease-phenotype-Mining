<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Restrictive mitral annuloplasty (RMA) is widely employed for patients with functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its improvement of left ventricular (LV) function has been demonstrated by only a gradual increase in LV ejection fraction (EF) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed evaluation of changes in LV function has not been fully elucidated in functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients before and after RMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE), which enables accurate evaluation of myocardial deformation and rotation that are undetectable by conventional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 13 patients (mean age 61 ± 10 years) with functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> undergoing RMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to conventional echocardiographic measurements, 2D-STE was performed to measure peak systolic radial (RS), circumferential (CS), and longitudinal (LS) strains and twist before and 4 ± 2 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV twist was defined as the difference between the apical and basal rotations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After RMA, EF and LS remained unchanged, but RS and CS were significantly improved at the mid-LV (RS, 20.6 ± 10.8 vs 24.5 ± 11.6%; CS, -9.6 ± 5.2 vs -12.8 ± 5.6%) and at the apex (RS, 15.0 ± 12.2 vs 18.7 ± 8.6%; CS, -4.4 ± 3.0 vs -7.8 ± 4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RS and CS were unchanged at the base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apical and basal rotations changed significantly, from 3.5°± 0.7° to 9.2°± 2.1°, and -2.1°± 0.7° to -3.8°± 1.0°, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the LV twist increased significantly, from 5.6°± 1.0° to 13.0°± 1.9° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radial and circumferential strains and LV twist increased significantly in the early postoperative period in functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients after RMA and concomitant procedures </plain></SENT>
