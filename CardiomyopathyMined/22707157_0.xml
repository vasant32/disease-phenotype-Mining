<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e>-RyR signalling becomes defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to reveal the ultrastructural mechanism underlying the defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e>-RyR signalling and contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> produced by transverse aortic constriction surgery, stereological analysis of transmission electron microscopic images showed that the volume density and the surface area of junctional SRs and those of SR-coupled TTs were both decreased in failing heart cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TT-SR junctions were displaced or missing from the Z-line areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the spatial span of individual TT-SR junctions was markedly reduced in failing heart cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numerical simulation and junctophilin-2 knockdown experiments demonstrated that the decrease in junction size (and thereby the constitutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> and RyR numbers) led to a scattered delay of Ca(2+) release activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The shrinking and eventual absence of TT-SR junctions are important mechanisms underlying the desynchronized and inhomogeneous Ca(2+) release and the decreased contractile strength in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maintaining the nanoscopic integrity of TT-SR junctions thus represents a therapeutic strategy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
