<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms leading from gene mutations to the HCM phenotype remain incompletely understood, partially because current mouse models of HCM do not faithfully reflect the human situation and early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> confounds the interpretation of functional alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate whether myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization and diastolic dysfunction are associated or precede the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) in HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the function of skinned and intact cardiac myocytes, as well as the intact heart in a recently developed Mybpc3-targeted knock-in mouse model carrying a point mutation frequently associated with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, 10-week old homozygous knock-in mice exhibited i) higher myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned ventricular trabeculae, ii) lower diastolic sarcomere length, and faster Ca(2+) transient decay in intact myocytes, and iii) LVH, reduced fractional shortening, lower E/A and E'/A', and higher E/E' ratios by echocardiography and Doppler analysis, suggesting systolic and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, heterozygous knock-in mice, which mimic the human HCM situation, did not exhibit LVH or systolic dysfunction, but exhibited higher myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, faster Ca(2+) transient decay, and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization and diastolic dysfunction are early phenotypic consequences of Mybpc3 mutations independent of LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The accelerated Ca(2+) transients point to compensatory mechanisms directed towards normalization of relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that HCM is a model for diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and this mouse model could be valuable in studying mechanisms and treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
