<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) are eventually found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate differentiation between these 2 conditions has implications for immunosuppressive therapy and familial screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be used to identify the characteristic findings to accurately differentiate between CS and ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with a diagnostic MRI scan indicating CS and/or ARVC constituted the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with CS had histologic confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ARVC met the diagnostic task force criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cardiac MRI data were retrospectively analyzed to identify possible differentiating characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 40 had CS and 21 had ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with CS were older and had more left ventricular scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> or left ventricular septal involvement was seen exclusively in the patients with CS (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> was seen only in the ARVC group (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The right ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular volumes were also significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with CS have significantly different cardiac MRI characteristics than patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cardiac volume, in addition to the degree and location of cardiac involvement, can be used to distinguish between these 2 disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and left ventricular septal scar favors a diagnosis of CS and not ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Consideration of CS should be given if these MRI findings are observed during the evaluation for possible ARVC </plain></SENT>
