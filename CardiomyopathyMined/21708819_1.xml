<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on admission (APG) are very common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) and can be the first indication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide insight into the prevalence of previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to compare different methods of diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with ACS with elevated APG who participated in the BIOMArCS 2 glucose trial underwent an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) prior to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>130 patients were included who underwent metabolic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 109 had an OGTT and 13 patients had pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The OGTT results were categorised as (previously) undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 35% of patients (fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) ≥7.0 mmol/l or 2-h post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥11.1 mmol/l) and impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in 44% (FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l or post-load <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 7.8-11.0 mmol/l), so only 21% had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> could not be adequately predicted with APG, FPG or HbA1c (area under the ROC curve 0.61, 0.75 and 0.72, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were significantly older, had higher admission HbA1c values, a higher Killip classification and more often had a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 79% of hyperglycaemic patients with ACS were found to have abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As APG, HbA1c and FPG had a low sensitivity to detect undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, an OGTT appears to be the best test to assess the presence of previously undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in hyperglycaemic patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
