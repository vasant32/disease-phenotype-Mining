<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is extremely rare and has never been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> symptoms after the incident, which initially presented as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> and appeared relatively not life-threatening, rapidly progressed to dangerous episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, and unexpected black-outs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Had there been effective emergency medical care protocols, diagnostic testing, treatment and <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidotes</z:chebi>, the latent manifestations of irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may have been prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given how quickly exposure led to morbidity, this article aims to raise an awareness of the toxic potential of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has particular relevance for workers involved in the production of semiconductors where there is a potential for accidental exposure to <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> by-products during device processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may also have implications for dentists who use <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> alloys to replace mercury containing amalgam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of threshold limit values and exposure limits for humans, as well as emergency medical guidelines for treatment of poisoning, the case calls on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish guidelines and medical management protocols specific for <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
