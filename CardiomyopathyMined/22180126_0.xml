<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Remote magnetic navigation (RMN) is considered to be a solution for mapping and ablation of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this systematic review we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of RMN in ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The National Library of Medicine's PubMed database was searched for articles containing any of a predetermined set of search terms that were published prior to November 1, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The database search resulted in 11 relevant articles evaluating the usefulness of RMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three groups of VTs were studied: VT in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICMP), non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICMP) and structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts (SNH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of RMN in patients with ICMP has been associated with success rates ranging from 71 to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RMN has been shown to be a feasible and effective method for ablation of VT in NICMP and SNH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Success rates between 50% and 100% have been reported in NICMP populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rates ranging from 86% to 100% have been reported for SNH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lowest rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence are reported for SNH patients (0-17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In ICMP and NICMP, recurrence rates of 0-30% and 14-50%, respectively, have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, and one patient experienced a thromboembolic event after RMN catheter ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RMN has been shown to be an effective and safe method for ablation of VT in various patient populations with low recurrence and complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, more comparative and randomized studies are necessary, and therefore the true value of RMN for VT ablation remains still unknown </plain></SENT>
