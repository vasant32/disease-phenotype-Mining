<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether treatment with β blockers (BBs) is of benefit to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) and provocable outflow obstruction (with none or with only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms) is largely unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we prospectively studied 27 patients with HC (age 36 ± 15 years; 81% men) with New York Heart Association class I or II, without obstruction at rest, but with exercise-induced left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of ≥ 30 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent exercise echocardiography at baseline and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7444">nadolol</z:chebi> (n = 18; 40 to 80 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> (n = 9; 5 to 10 mg/day), according to a prespecified protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Without the BBs, the postexercise LVOT gradient was 87 ± 29 mm Hg and &gt;50 mm Hg in 25 patients (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 12 ± 4-month period of BB treatment, the postexercise LVOT gradient had decreased to 36 ± 22 mm Hg (p &lt;0.001) and was virtually abolished (to 0 or &lt;30 mm Hg) in 14 patients (52%), substantially blunted (≥ 20 mm Hg reduction) in 9 (33%), and unchanged in only 4 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe postexercise obstruction (range 58 to 80 mm Hg) persisted in 6 patients (22% compared to 93% without BBs; p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonresponders (residual postexercise gradient of ≥ 30 mm Hg with BBs) were characterized by an <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp> (hazard ratio 2.03/1 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.4; p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with HC with mild or no symptoms, treatment with BBs can prevent the development of LVOT obstruction triggered by physiologic exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a rationale for the novel strategy of early prophylactic pharmacologic treatment with standard, well-tolerated doses of BBs in physically active patients with provocable gradients, aimed at effective prevention of the hemodynamic burden associated with dynamic obstruction </plain></SENT>
