<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that Fe(2+) uptake in thalassemic cardiomyocytes is mainly mediated by T-type calcium channels (TTCCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, direct evidence regarding Fe(3+) uptake, the other form of NTBI, in thalassemic cardiomyocytes has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearts from genetic-altered Î²-thalassemic mice and adult <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were used for cultured ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blockers for L-type calcium channel (LTCC), TTCC, transferrin receptor1 (TfR1), and divalent metal transporter1 (DMT1) were used, and quantification of cellular iron uptake was performed by the acetoxymethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi> fluorescence assay </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, could prevent Fe(3+) uptake into cultured cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that, unlike Fe(2+), Fe(3+) uptake in cultured thalassemic cardiomyocytes is not mainly mediated by TfR1, DMT1, LTCC, and TTCC, suggesting that another alternative pathway could play a major role in Fe(3+) uptake in thalassemic cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
