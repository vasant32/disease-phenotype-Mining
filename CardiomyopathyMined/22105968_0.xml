<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LVMI has not been linked to cardiovascular endpoints in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify an association between elevated LVMI and echocardiographic markers of systolic and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis patients from June 1995 to December 2009 at a single tertiary care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The upper limit cutoffs for LVMI were set at &gt;38.6 g/m(2.7), &gt;51 g/m(2.7), and by age and sex-based normative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients (mean age 14.1 years, 56% males) were enrolled in the study, with a total of 287 echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Post-dialysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with elevated LVMI in both the &gt;51 g/m(2.7) [odds ratio (OR) 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-5.5] and normative (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.7) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated LVMI, when defined by the &gt;51 g/m(2.7) and normative models, was significantly associated with decreased shortening fraction (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.8 and OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.3-22.9, respectively) and increased mitral E wave to lateral mitral tissue Doppler e' wave velocity ratio (E/e'; OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-11.2 and OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.0-21.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated LVMI is associated with decreased systolic and diastolic cardiac function, justifying its use as a surrogate of hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in children undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis </plain></SENT>
