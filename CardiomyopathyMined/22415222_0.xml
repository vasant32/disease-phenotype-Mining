<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no data on the effect of the etiology of HF on the improvement after pacemaker upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess changes in various parameters in patients with ischemic (IC) and nonischemic (NIC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after pacemaker upgrade in pacemaker-dependent patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, in the course of advanced HF during 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 34 patients who underwent an upgrade from right ventricular apical to biventricular or bifocal right ventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient, 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, 6-minute walking test, and the measurement of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic etiology of HF was confirmed in 25 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were compared in terms of the improvement in relative and absolute values of the parameters at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the subgroups did not differ significantly in demographic data and the measured parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed the first period of followâ€‘up showing clinical improvement after pacemaker upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater relative increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction was observed in the NIC subgroup at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The whole 12-month follow-up period was completed by a similar percentage of the IC and NIC patients (76% vs. 88.9%; P = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the IC subgroup, a greater degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IC or NIC who underwent an upgrade from right ventricular apical to biventricular or bifocal right ventricular pacing and completed a 12-month follow-up did not differ in clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
