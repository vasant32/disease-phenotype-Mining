<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is largely dependent on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> Inducible Factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many target genes have been characterised for these heterodimeric transcription factors, yet there is evidence that the full range of HIF-regulated genes has not yet been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constructed a TetON overexpression system in the rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> PC-12 cell line to search for novel HIF and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> responsive genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Rgs4 gene encodes the Regulator of G-Protein Signalling 4 (RGS4) protein, an inhibitor of signalling from G-protein coupled receptors, and dysregulation of Rgs4 is linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rgs4 was found to be responsive to HIF-2Î± overexpression, hypoxic treatment, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> mimetic drugs in PC-12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar responses were observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell lines SK-N-SH and SK-N-BE(2)C, but not in endothelial cells, where Rgs4 transcript is readily detected but does not respond to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this regulation was found to be dependent on transcription, and occurs in a manner consistent with direct HIF transactivation of Rgs4 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no HIF binding site was detectable within 32 kb of the human Rgs4 gene locus, leading to the possibility of regulation by long-distance genomic interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research into Rgs4 regulation by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and HIF may result in better understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, and also shed light on the other roles of HIF yet to be discovered </plain></SENT>
