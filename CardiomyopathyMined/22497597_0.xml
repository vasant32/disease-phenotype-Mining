<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism of disease in AFD is an infiltrative, diffuse process, whereas HCM is a primary heart muscle condition with patchy distribution, which may prompt differences in myocardial mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess myocardial mechanics in AFD according to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) compared to nonobstructive HCM (NHCM) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a single-center, retrospective study in a small, genetically confirmed AFD cohort, which was divided into a subgroup with LVH (LVH+, n = 19), and without LVH (LVH-, n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison groups were healthy controls (n = 40) and NHCM patients (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vector Velocity Imaging was applied to two-dimensional echocardiography studies for assessment of longitudinal strain (LS), circumferential strain (CS), and base-to-apex CS gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AFD LVH+ patients had lower global LS than AFD LVH- patients (-14 ± 4% vs -17 ± 3%, P &lt; 0.05), but similarly lowered global CS (-24 ± 5% vs -22 ± 5%, P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AFD LVH+ and NHCM had similarly lowered global LS compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, but significantly lower global CS was observed in AFD LVH+ (-24 ± 5% vs -28 ± 4%, P &lt; 0.05), whereas it was significantly increased in NHCM (-31 ± 2% vs -28 ± 4%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike NHCM, in both AFD subgroups, patients lost their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> base-to-apex CS gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AFD patients without LVH already show abnormal systolic myocardial mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relevant differences in myocardial mechanics between AFD patients with LVH compared to NHCM reflect the different underlying mechanisms of disease </plain></SENT>
