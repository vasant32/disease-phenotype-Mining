<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have shown that CyPA and CD147 are upregulated in patients with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the role of CyPA and CD147 in murine coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVB3-infected CyPA(-/-) mice (129S6/SvEv) revealed a significantly reduced T-cell and macrophage recruitment at 8 days p.i. compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In A.BY/SnJ mice, treatment with the cyclophilin-inhibitor NIM811 was associated with a reduction of inflammatory lesions and MMP-9 expression but with enhanced virus replication 8 days p.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 28 days p.i. the extent of lesion areas was not affected bei NIM811, whereas the collagen content was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initiation of NIM811-treatment on day 12 (after an effective virus defense) resulted in an even more pronounced reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in CVB3-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> CyPA is important for macrophage and T cell recruitment and effective virus defense and may represent a pharmacological target to modulate myocardial remodeling in <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
