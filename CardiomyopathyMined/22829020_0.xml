<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a sarcomeric protein that dynamically regulates thick-filament structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In constitutive cMyBP-C knockout (cMyBP-C(-/-)) mice, loss of cMyBP-C has been linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, although the pathogenesis of these phenotypes remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated cMyBP-C conditional knockout (cMyBP-C-cKO) mice expressing floxed cMyBP-C alleles and a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-inducible Cre-recombinase fused to 2 mutated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of structural and functional phenotypes caused by the loss of cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In adult cMyBP-C-cKO mice, knockdown of cMyBP-C over a 2-month period resulted in a corresponding impairment of diastolic function and a concomitant abbreviation of systolic ejection, although contractile function was largely preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in cardiac structure or <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were immediately evident; however, mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> developed after near-complete knockdown of cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to pressure overload induced by transaortic constriction, cMyBP-C-cKO mice treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> also developed greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp>, and reduced contractile function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that myocardial dysfunction is largely caused by the removal of cMyBP-C and occurs before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cytoarchitectural remodeling in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>-treated cMyBP-C-cKO myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, near ablation of cMyBP-C in adult myocardium primarily leads to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in contrast to the dilated phenotype evident in cMyBP-C(-/-) mice, which highlights the importance of additional factors such as loading stress in determining the expression and progression of cMyBP-C-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
