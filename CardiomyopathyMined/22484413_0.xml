<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether it may improve cardiac function and physical tolerance in diabetic patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is still not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated the effectiveness of trimetazidine in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Volunteers with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were recruited for participation in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group received trimetazidine (20mg, t.i.d.) for 6months (n=40), while another group received a placebo during the same period (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received an echocardiographic examination, 6-minute walk test and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> biochemical analysis (C reactive protein) at baseline and after 6months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: No significant adverse events or changes in clinical or biochemical parameters were detected through the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6months, TMZ-treated patients had a significant improvement in systolic function as compared with control patients associated with an increased ratio of E/A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C reactive protein concentrations remained stable throughout the study in trimetazidine group at baseline and at the 6month on follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In comparison, it increased significantly in the control group at the 6-month follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NT-pro BNP levels did not change in the control group, whereas they significantly decreased in the trimetazidine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The physical activity tolerance level improved in the trimetazidine group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Trimetazidine treatment was associated with a significant improvement of cardiac function and physical tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results also suggested that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was decreased in trimetazidine group as compared with control patients </plain></SENT>
