<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The CentriMag ventricular assist device (VAD) has gained popularity in the last several years as rescue support for patients with decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used the CentriMag VAD as a bridge to decision device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with device placement, use and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent CentriMag placement at our institution from January 2007 to August 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients had placement of a CentriMag device, with 43% (n = 27) of these being placed due to failure of medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases were the focus of our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary diagnoses were ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 7) or other (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 47.1 (range 7 to 72) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to implant, 85% of patients were on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, 70% were on vasopressors, and 44% were on more than one inotrope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERMACS score was 1 in 67% of patients and 2 in 33% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients were bridged to a long-term device, 8 to transplantation and 10 to recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent (24 of 27) of patients survived to explant and 74% (20 of 27) survived to hospital discharge, with a 1-year survival of 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications occurred in 10 patients, including 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients who survived to discharge, those who died had a significantly higher body mass index (30.8 vs 24.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Survivors to discharge demonstrated significant improvements in hepatic and renal function over the course of device support while non-survivors did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CentriMag demonstrates promising results when used in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> refractory to medical management </plain></SENT>
