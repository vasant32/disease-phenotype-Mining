<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No other family member was affected, suggesting that our patient was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T8306C mutation was heteroplasmic in several tissues of the proband, while it was absent from his asymptomatic siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single fibre analysis confirmed the segregation of higher mutational load in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase-deficient fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation T8306C is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved base pair and was not found in more than 120 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding broadens the phenotypic and molecular spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29185">tRNA(Lys)</z:chebi> associated disorders </plain></SENT>
