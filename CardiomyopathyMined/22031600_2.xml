<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored the role of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase Nox4 as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phosphorothioated antisense (AS) or sense (S) oligonucleotides for Nox4 were administered for 2 wk to rats made diabetic by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity, ROS generation, and the expression of Nox4, but Nox1 or Nox2, were increased in left ventricular tissue of the diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of molecular markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and myofibrosis including fibronectin, collagen, α-smooth muscle actin, and β-myosin heavy chain were also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These parameters were attenuated by the administration of AS but not S Nox4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the impairment of contractility observed in diabetic rats was prevented in AS- but not S-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cultured cardiac myocytes to 25 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HG)] increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity, the expression of Nox4, and molecular markers of cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects of HG were prevented in cells infected with adenoviral vector containing a dominant negative form of Nox4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides strong evidence that Nox4 is an important source of ROS in the left ventricle and that Nox4-derived ROS contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at early stages of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
