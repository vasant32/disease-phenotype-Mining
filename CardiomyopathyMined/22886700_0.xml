<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One-third of patients who receive cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are classified as nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of responders to CRT have been studied in multiple clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Independent predictors of CRT response may be identified by studying a series of patients in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One hundred twenty-five patients were examined retrospectively from a multidisciplinary CRT clinic program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic CRT response was defined as a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume of â‰¥15% and/or absolute increase of 5% in LV ejection fraction at the 6-month visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 81 responders and 44 nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By univariate analyses, female sex, nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> etiology, baseline QRS duration, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index predicted CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only QRS duration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>, and LVEDV index were independent predictors (QRS width, odds ratio [OR]: 1.027, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.004-1.050, P = 0.023; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>, OR: 3.568, 95% CI: 1.284-9.910, P = 0.015; LVEDV index, OR: 0.970, 95% CI: 0.953-0.987, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although female sex and nonischemic etiology were associated with an improved CRT response on univariate analyses, after adjusting for LV volumes they were not independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: QRS width, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>, and LVEDV index are independent predictors for echocardiographic CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previously reported differences in CRT response for sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> etiology are associated with differences in baseline LV volumes in our clinical practice </plain></SENT>
