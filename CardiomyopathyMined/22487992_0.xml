<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE:: Discrete upper septal thickening (DUST) has been well described in the echocardiology literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the computed tomography findings of DUST, however, have not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Five hundred consecutive coronary computed tomography angiograms were evaluated by 2 cardiothoracic radiologists for the presence of DUST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Of the 500 studies reviewed, 23 cases had features consistent with DUST (23/500=5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average systolic blood pressure of patients with DUST (150/77 mm Hg) was higher than that of patients without DUST (133/75 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with DUST were older (mean 63 y) than patients without DUST (mean 50 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had evidence of abnormal systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve on cine imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: DUST is seen on coronary computed tomography angiograms and has imaging characteristics distinct from significant pathology, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognizing DUST is important because, unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, previous studies have not found an associated adverse prognosis with DUST </plain></SENT>
