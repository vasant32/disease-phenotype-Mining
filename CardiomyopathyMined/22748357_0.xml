<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic quantification of regional myocardial perfusion (rMP), myocardial blood flow (MBF), and coronary flow reserve are comparable between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> and the newer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> regadenoson in HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional aim was to evaluate the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>-induced ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on electrocardiography and myocardial flow in HC </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> and regadenoson groups consisted of 28 and 29 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, including rest MBF (0.92 ± 0.22 vs 0.89 ± 0.23 ml/min/g, p = 0.60), were similar between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During stress, the presence and severity of abnormal rMP (summed difference score 5.5 ± 5.5 vs 5.8 ± 6.7, p = 0.80), peak MBF (1.81 ± 0.44 vs 1.82 ± 0.50 ml/min/g, p = 0.90), and coronary flow reserve (2.02 ± 0.53 vs 2.12 ± 0.12, p = 0.50) were comparable between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> and regadenoson groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients exhibited side effects with regadenoson (2 vs 7, p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, measurement of rMP and quantitative flow with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography is similar between regadenoson and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> in patients with symptomatic HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regadenoson is tolerated better than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> and is easier to administer </plain></SENT>
