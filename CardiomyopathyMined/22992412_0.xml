<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if longitudinal strain based on speckle tracking can detect subtle right (RV) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction as an early sign of ARVC.Methods and resultsSeventeen male patients, fulfilling Task force criteria for ARVC, 49 (32--70) years old, nineteen male first degree relatives 29 (19--73) y.o. and twenty-two healthy male volunteers 36 (24--66) y.o participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve-lead and signal-averaged electrocardiograms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV and RV diameters, peak systolic velocity from tissue Doppler and longitudinal strain based on speckle tracking were measured from the basal and mid segments in both ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RV longitudinal strain measurement was successful in first degree relatives and controls (95 resp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>86%) but less feasible in patients (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were not systematically different between first degree relatives and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using discriminant analysis, we then developed an index based on echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls had an index &lt; l while patients with abnormal ventricles had an index between 1--4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some of the first degree relatives deviated from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Longitudinal strain of LV and RV segments was significantly lower in patients than in relatives and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An index was developed incorporating dimensional and functional echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In combination with genetic testing this index might help to detect early phenotype expression in mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
