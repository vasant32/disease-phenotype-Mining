<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review of the literature evaluates the effect of therapeutic intervention on cardiac parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies investigating the impact of treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> on cardiac function published between January 1980 and January 2009 were identified through electronic searches of Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suppression of GH and IGF-1 following surgery or medical treatment with somatostatin analogue therapy is effective in decreasing left ventricular (LV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, with subsequent improvement in cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First-line treatment with somatostatin analogues resulted in improved cardiac outcome compared with first-line surgery, possibly due to somatostatin analogues acting directly through somatostatin receptors on cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional cardiac improvement has been reported when somatostatin analogue treatment was combined with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients where complete biochemical control was not achieved, an improved cardiac performance following treatment with somatostatin analogues has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with pegvisomant has been demonstrated to reduce LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and improve diastolic and systolic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reports have suggested that treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51065">dopamine agonist</z:chebi> cabergoline increased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although surgery and somatostatin analogues are effective in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, a greater beneficial effect is observed with somatostatin analogue treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> should consider first-line therapy or pre-treatment with somatostatin analogues prior to surgery to achieve biochemical control and improve cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
