<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine fatty acid accumulation and its toxic effects in cells, we analyzed skin fibroblasts from six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trifunctional protein deficiency</z:e>, who had abnormalities in the second through fourth reactions in fatty acid β-oxidation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found free fatty acid accumulation, enhanced three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenases, catalyzing the first reaction in the β-oxidation system and being assumed to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities in these patients, and PPARα activation that was confirmed in the experiments using MK886, a PPARα specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi>, a PPARα specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These novel findings suggest that the fatty acid accumulation and the resulting PPARα activation are major causes of the increase in the β-oxidation ability as probable compensation for fatty acid metabolism in the patients' fibroblasts, and that enhanced cell proliferation and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> due to the PPARα activation relate to the development of specific clinical features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003756'>skeletal myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, significant suppression of the PPARα activation by means of MK886 treatment is assumed to provide a new method of treating this deficiency </plain></SENT>
