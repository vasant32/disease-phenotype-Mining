<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015958" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">twin-twin transfusion syndrome</z:e> (TTTS) in its early stages (Quintero Stages I and II) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the prevalence, severity, incidence and rate of progression of recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in Stages I and II TTTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 451 cases of TTTS evaluated between 2004 and 2009, 123 (27.3%) cases of Stages I and II were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was used to 'upstage' cases based on the presence or absence of mild (IIIA), moderate (IIIB), or severe (IIIC) recipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined by worsening in the degree of recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from initial presentation or failure to respond to amnioreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome data included progression of recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, treatment and survival to birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were compared by the chi-square, Fisher's exact test or t-test as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven of 123 (62.6%) cases were Quintero Stage I and 46/123 (37.4%) Quintero Stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty (65.0%) were upstaged to Cincinnati Stage IIIA (n = 25), IIIB (n = 23) or IIIC (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Management included observation in 11 (8.9%), amnioreduction in 26 (21.1%), amnioreduction followed by selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) in 43 (35.0%) and primary SFLP in 43 (35.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 80 cases managed by observation or amnioreduction initially, 43 (53.8%) progressed within a mean duration of 1.4 ± 1.5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of progression increased significantly as degree of recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at presentation worsened: Stage I, 9/27 (33.3%); Stage II, 8/15 (53.3%); Stage IIIA, 8/16 (50.0%); Stage IIIB, 10/10 (100%); and Stage IIIC, 8/12 (66.7%) (χ(2) = 14, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall fetal survival was 205 out of 244 (84.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fetal survival with observation only was 81.8% (18/22), with amnioreduction only it was 92.3% (48/52), with initial observation or amnioreduction followed by SFLP it was 86.9% (73/84) and with primary SFLP it was 76.7% (66/86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Echocardiography demonstrates a high incidence of recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in early-stage TTTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The more advanced the recipient-twin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is, the more likely is progression to occur during observation or following amnioreduction </plain></SENT>
