<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data with regard to the clinical spectrum according to left ventricle (LV) morphological variation in stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (SCMP) patients, and still there is controversy in terms of prognosis since some people believe that the published in-hospital mortality data of patients with SCMP are underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to investigate the morphological features of LV and in-hospital outcome of patients with SCMP and explored predictors of short-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational study of 208 SCMP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological features of LV were determined by echocardiography and were divided into typical (apical) and atypical ballooning types, which were subcategorized into mid-LV ballooning and basal 'inverted' ballooning type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality of patients with SCMP during hospitalization was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The apical ballooning type was most common (67.3%) in SCMP followed by the mid-LV ballooning type (28.3%), and the basal 'inverted' ballooning type (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in stressor types and in-hospital mortality between patients with typical and atypical SCMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the in-hospital mortality of SCMP patients occurred in patients with physical stressors, where age, shock, and LV ejection fraction were the independent risk factors for predicting in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SCMP patients showed diverse patterns of LV <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but there were no definite differences on clinical spectrum among SCMP patients presenting various LV morphological patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In terms of short-term prognosis, underlying physical conditions combined with old age, hemodynamic compromise, and low LV systolic function might be the most important factors in SCMP patients </plain></SENT>
