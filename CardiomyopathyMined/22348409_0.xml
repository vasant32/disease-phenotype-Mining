<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiographic guidance, an Impella 2.5 L heart pump was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inflow catheter was distal to the aortic valve, however patient remained in shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real time three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the inflow catheter imbedded into the papillary muscle causing inlet occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By cropping 3D data set in multiple planes, a better spatial visualization of the inflow catheter and its distance from the aortic valve was easily obtained and the device was adjusted </plain></SENT>
