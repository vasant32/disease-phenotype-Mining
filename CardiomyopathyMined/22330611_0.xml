<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is associated with a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses of data from randomized clinical trials suggest that these differences result in a differential response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapies, including a somewhat better response to Î²-blockers, a worse prognosis with digoxin therapy, and a lower survival benefit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, female patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> also derive significantly greater improvements in cardiac volumes from cardiac resynchronization therapy than do male patients, and this treatment is associated with reduced risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events among women with mild symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that sex-related differences might exist in response to both medical and device therapies for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
