<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plasma levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker carbohydrate 125 antigen (CA 125) have been found elevated among patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prognostic value of CA125 in a population of patients with mild to moderate HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum levels of CA 125 were obtained in 102 patients with mild to moderate HF from idiopathic (48%) or ischemic (52%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (age 64 ± 10.4 years, left ventricular ejection fraction: 34.4 ± 8.5%), under optimized medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (43 ± 15 months), 16 (15.7%) cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 23 (22.5%) cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> + HF hospitalizations were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves by the log-rank test showed that patients with CA 125 levels higher than the cut-off value (30 U/mL) had a worse survival (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was observed also when considering cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>+ HF hospitalizations as the secondary end point (P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional stepwise hazards regression analysis was performed and showed that CA 125 and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) were significantly associated with the risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> + HF hospitalizations (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, and HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.1, P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In mild-to-moderate HF patients under optimized therapy, higher plasma CA 125 levels are an effective long-term prognostic marker in forecasting cardiovascular events and HF hospitalization and may contribute to a better risk stratification </plain></SENT>
