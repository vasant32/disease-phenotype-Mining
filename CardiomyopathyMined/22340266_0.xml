<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) overexpression may inhibit myocardial collagen accumulation and improve left ventricular (LV) remodeling and function in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> activates the renin-Ang system, which promotes the accumulation of extracellular matrix and progression of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety male Wistar rats were divided randomly into treatment (n = 80) and control (n = 10) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced in the treatment group by a single intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> injection, rats in the treatment group were further divided into adenovirus-ACE2, adenovirus-enhanced green fluorescent protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, and mock groups (n = 20 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV volume; LV systolic and diastolic function; extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>; protein expression levels of ACE2, Ang-converting enzyme, and Ang-(1-7); and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac myocyte and fibroblast culture was performed to assess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang-II</z:chebi> and collagen protein expression before and after ACE2 gene transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four weeks after ACE2 gene transfer, the adenovirus-ACE2 group showed increased ACE2 expression, matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, and LV ejection fractions and decreased LV volumes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, and ACE, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang-II</z:chebi>, and collagen expression in comparison with the adenovirus-enhanced green fluorescent protein and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ACE2 was superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> in improving LV remodeling and function and reducing collagen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The putative mechanisms may involve a shift in balance toward an inhibited fibroblast-myocyte cross-talk for collagen and transforming growth factor-beta production and enhanced collagen degradation by matrix metalloproteinase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 inhibits myocardial collagen accumulation and improves LV remodeling and function in a rat model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, ACE2 provides a promising approach to the treatment of patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
