<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare health status and quality-of-life outcomes for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) and high surgical risk treated with either transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For high-risk patients with severe AS, TAVR has been shown to result in similar 12-month survival but differing adverse events compared with AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the health status of 628 patients with severe, symptomatic AS at high risk of surgical complications who were randomized to either TAVR or AVR in the PARTNER Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Health status was assessed at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months using the Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire, the Short Form-12, and the EuroQol-5D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome, the Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire summary score, improved more rapidly with TAVR, but was similar for the 2 groups at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant interaction between the benefit of TAVR and access site (transapical vs. transfemoral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for transfemoral TAVR demonstrated significant health status benefits with TAVR versus AVR at 1 month (difference, 9.9 points; 95% confidence interval: 4.9 to 14.9; p &lt; 0.001), whereas patients treated via the TA approach demonstrated no benefits with TAVR compared with AVR at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results for Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire subscales and generic measures demonstrated similar patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk patients with severe AS, health status improved substantially between baseline and 1 year after either TAVR or AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TAVR via the transfemoral, but not the transapical route, was associated with a short-term advantage compared with surgery </plain></SENT>
