<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of dual-source parallel radiofrequency (RF) transmission with patient-adaptive local RF shimming on image quality, image contrast, and diagnostic confidence at routine clinical cardiac magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging with use of a 3.0-T dual-channel transmit whole-body <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Written informed consent was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in 28 patients by using a 3.0-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit equipped with a dual-source RF transmission system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of conventional versus dual-source RF transmission on steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences and turbo spin-echo (TSE) black-blood (BB) sequences was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homogeneity of the B1 field and contrast-to-noise ratios (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50807">CNRs</z:chebi>) were measured and tested for statistical significance with the paired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were analyzed qualitatively for homogeneity, the presence of off-resonance artifacts, and diagnostic confidence independently by two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with κ statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitative image analysis revealed that B1 homogeneity and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> were significantly improved for images acquired with dual-source RF transmission compared with conventional RF transmission (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The quality of SSFP and TSE BB images of the left and the right ventricles showed a significant improvement with respect to image homogeneity and diagnostic confidence as evaluated by the readers (P = .0001, κ &gt; 0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a side effect, off-resonance artifacts were significantly reduced on SSFP images (P = .0001, κ &gt; 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dual-source parallel RF transmission significantly improves image homogeneity, image contrast, and diagnostic confidence compared with conventional RF transmission of cardiac SSFP and TSE BB sequences </plain></SENT>
