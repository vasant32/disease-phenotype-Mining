<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 218 consecutive children with a first diagnosis of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haematological evaluation was performed at first diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> or cardiac transplantation was the main outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 0.6 years, ranging from 1 day to 15.8 years and median follow-up was 2.65 years, ranging from 0 to 17.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median interval of 0.2 years, ranging from 0 to 8.7 years, 56 patients died and 25 were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival at 1 and 5 years was 68% (95% confidence interval, 63-75%) and 62% (95% confidence interval, 56-69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> less than 10 grams per decilitre, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> over 8 millimoles per litre, and C-reactive protein over 10 milligrams per litre were found in 24%, 20%, and 24% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test showed that <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = 0.000) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.021) were predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate Cox model, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (hazard ratio = 0.735; confidence interval = 0.636-0.849; p = 0.000) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (hazard ratio = 1.083; confidence interval = 1:002-1:171; p = 0.045) were predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cubic spline functions showed that the positive role of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> on survival was linear for values less than 12 grams per decilitre and null for values more than 12 grams per decilitre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adaptive index models for risk stratification and Classification and Regression Tree analysis allowed to identify the cut-off values for <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (less than 10.2 grams per decilitre) and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (more than 8.8 millimoles per litre), as well as to derive a predictor model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is the strongest independent prognostic factor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation </plain></SENT>
