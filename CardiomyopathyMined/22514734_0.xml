<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) frequently die with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) or die suddenly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, although these symptoms are not always observed at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear how and when HF and arrhythmogenic changes develop in these <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to address this issue, properties of the myocardium and underlying gene expressions were studied using a knock-in mouse model of human inherited <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> caused by a deletion mutation Î”K210 in cardiac troponinT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By 1 month, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice had already <z:mp ids='MP_0000274'>enlarged hearts</z:mp>, but showed no symptoms of HF and a much lower mortality than at 2 months or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At around 2 months, some would die suddenly with no clear symptoms of HF, whereas at 3 months, many of the survivors showed evident symptoms of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isolated left ventricular myocardium (LV) from 2 month-mice, spontaneous activity frequently occurred and action potential duration (APD) was prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient outward (I(to)) and ultrarapid delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (I(Kur)) currents were significantly reduced in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, down-regulation of Kv4.2, Kv1.5 and KChIP2 was evident in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LVs at 3-months, more frequent spontaneous activity, greater prolongation of APD and further down-regulation in above <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 month, in contrast, infrequent spontaneous activity and down-regulation of Kv4.2, but not Kv1.5 or KChIP2, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that at least three steps of electrical remodeling occur in the hearts of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> model mice, and that the combined down-regulation of Kv4.2, Kv1.5 and KChIP2 prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of HF may play an important role in the premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in this <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice at 1 month or before, on the contrary, are associated with low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in spite of inborn disorder and <z:mp ids='MP_0000274'>enlarged heart</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
