<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, hypokinesis or akinesis occurs in the mid- and apical segments of the left ventricle in the absence of epicardial coronary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preserved or hyperdynamic function of the basal myocardial segments results in apical ballooning, assuming the shape of a Japanese pot used to catch octopus (a takotsubo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on 2 well over 70 years old women (78 and 82 years) admitted to the emergency room with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs, ECG alterations and high troponin I in both patients imposed urgent diagnostic testing and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiographic findings were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and transthoracic echocardiography showed in both simultaneous apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002304'>akinesia</z:hpo> and a hyperkinetic basal area with a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography, performed on an emergency basis, in both cases revealed minimal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> irregularities, with no evidence of plaque rupture or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The wall motion abnormality extended beyond the distribution of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">single coronary artery</z:e>, making it less likely that an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> had spontaneously dissolved or that intermittent vasospasm had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings were consistent with ABS, and critical observations on coronary angiography indicated the diagnosis by exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were seen in the clinic 4 weeks after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They had had no recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, and had returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life they had had before the cardiovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A repeat echocardiography showed a normalized estimated ejection fraction in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ABS is a diagnosis of exclusion and its incidence is probably underestimated in elderly patients in whom coronary angiography is not common </plain></SENT>
