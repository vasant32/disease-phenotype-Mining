<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We trialled respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis in such infants during 2008–2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RSV admissions between 2005–2009 and examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> who received palivizumab in 2008–2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infants with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> had a more complicated course of RSV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> with longer hospital stay, more frequent intensive care admission, longer intensive care stay and were more likely to receive respiratory support (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventeen infants with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> received palivizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, two (1.7%) required admission for RSV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a reduction in admission of infants with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> with RSV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> in 2008–2009 (2% per year) compared with 2005–2007 (5–9% per year; P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> who required intensive care for RSV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> in the same period was unchanged, as a number presented to our service with RSV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> prior to commencing immunoprophylaxis or having had their cardiac diagnosis made in other centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other infants, those with haemodynamically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> have a more complicated course of illness with RSV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these infants, palivizumab reduced the number of hospitalisations because of RSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cohorting patients for maximal palivizumab use reduced overall cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To significantly impact on intensive care admissions overall, immunoprophylaxis should be considered at a regional level </plain></SENT>
