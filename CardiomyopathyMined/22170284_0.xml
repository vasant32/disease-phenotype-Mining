<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is characterized by fibrofatty replacement of muscular fibers predominantly in the right ventricle and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> as the main clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several components of the desmosome genes have been identified and mutations of the plakophilin-2 (PKP-2) gene are a common cause of ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between genotype and phenotype in a family with a novel PKP-2 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study describes the clinical findings and genetic analysis in a family with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A part of the family has been followed clinically long term for up to 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two not previously reported PKP-2 variants (L506P and T526A) have been identified in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of this family share the novel variant L506P, the clinical features, i.e., their phenotypes are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The L506P variant is located in exon 7 and affects a highly conserved residue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same amino acid, leucine, is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species evaluated, indicating a functional importance and the variant is predicted to be damaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The novel L506P variant in the PKP-2 gene is thus a possible pathogenic alteration in the described family with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the T526A variant is weakly conserved and predicted to be tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While many of the reported ARVC mutations are truncating mutations, the possibly damaging variant found in this family, is a missense alteration affecting a highly conserved residue 506 located in exon 7 </plain></SENT>
