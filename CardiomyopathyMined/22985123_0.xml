<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Vector flow mapping was performed in 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and LV ejection fraction (EF) &gt;50%, 70 patients with EF &lt;50% (13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and 57 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>), and 62 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and patients with EF &gt;50%, the intraventricular vortex dissipated quickly during early ejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with EF &lt;50%, the vortex stayed mainly at apex and persisted for a significantly longer time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The evolution of vortex during ejection was significantly correlated with QRS width, EF, fractional shortening, LV outflow velocity time integral, wall motion score index (WMSI), LV dimensions, left atrial diameter, and diastolic mitral annular velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV end-diastolic short diameter and WMSI were the independent determinants of the duration of vortex (R(2)  = 0.482, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End-systolic short diameter and apical WMSI were the independent determinants of duration of vortex corrected for ejection time (R(2)  = 0.565, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>End-systolic short diameter was the independent determinant of percentage change in vortex area during early ejection (R(2)  = 0.355, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>End-systolic short diameter and ejection time were the independent determinants of percentage change in vortex flow volume (R(2)  = 0.415, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: In patients with LV systolic dysfunction, the vortex persists during ejection and stays mainly at apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The vortex evolution during ejection is closely associated with LV dimensions and functions </plain></SENT>
