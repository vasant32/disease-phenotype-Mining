<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review provides the rationale for integrating genomic and protein biomarkers in the evolving diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and its causal pathway to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), with a larger objective to serve as a template for genomic and phenomic profiling of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> is a major cause of HF and accounts for more than half of heart transplantation in adults and children worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> may remain asymptomatic for years, but HF and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, both late manifestations of the disease, ultimately cause significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> has a genetic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> can also result from environmental injury such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, toxins, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While molecular genetic testing can identify those at risk for genetic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, epigenetic and sentinel phenomic staging can help to identify those at highest risk in need for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phenomic staging includes integrating clinical and imaging features, transcriptomics, higher order proteomics and metabolomics interactions, and epidemiological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This principle can be applied in family members of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, where genetic testing and clinical phenotyping are indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This will allow the design of specific interventions tailored to individuals sharing similar risks, to alter the natural history of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and obviate complications such as HF/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
