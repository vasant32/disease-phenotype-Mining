<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five cases of MPA, comprised of 33 men and 22 women, diagnosed according to a new consensus algorithm at a single tertiary hospital were identified for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main clinical features were constitutional symptoms (78.2%), followed by renal involvement (74.5%), musculoskeletal symptoms (67.3%), skin manifestations (50.9%), neurologic involvement (43.6%), and lung involvement (41.8%) </plain></SENT>
