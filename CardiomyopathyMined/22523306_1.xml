<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of the first randomized trial of BMNC therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients 18 to 75 years of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, New York Heart Association class II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;35, and optimized therapy were randomized to intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the difference in LVEF from baseline to 6 and 12 months after treatment between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat and powered to detect an absolute between-group difference of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between July 2005 and October 2009, 234 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients abandoned the study and 49 were excluded because of protocol violation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 183 patients, 93 in the placebo group and 90 in the BMNC group, had a trimmed mean age of 52.4 years (range, 50.8-54.0 years) and LVEF of 26.1 (range, 25.1-27.1) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median number of injected BMNCs was 2.20×10(8) (range, 1.40-3.50×10(8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Change in LVEF did not differ significantly between treatment groups: trimmed mean change in LVEF at 6 months, 3.0 (1.3-4.8) for BMNCs and 2.5 (0.6-4.5) for placebo (P=0.519); change in LVEF at 12 months, 3.5 (1.5-5.5) for BMNCs and 3.7 (1.5-6.0) for placebo (P=0.850) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, New York Heart Association functional class, Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, and 6-minute walking test did also not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs does not improve left ventricular function or quality of life in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
