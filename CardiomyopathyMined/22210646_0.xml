<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since November 2009, 10 patients (9 men and 1 woman; mean age, 49.7 Â± 14.4 y) suffering from idiopathic dilatative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> received BVAD employing two implantable continuous-flow pumps of the HeartWare type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three male patients, aged 53, 57, and 60 years, after a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support time of 15.6, 11.2, and 3.6 months, respectively, the RVAD was stopped, and the percutaneous lead was surgically shortened in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in preoperative RV geometry and function or in severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0006044'>tricuspid valve regurgitation</z:mp> in patients with and without delayed RV recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiography revealed no regurgitation through the right pump in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> 63 days later; the other two patients are currently on left ventricular assist devices support at home, 120 and 236 days after RVAD deactivation with stable hemodynamic conditions and without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RV function may recover even after weeks or months on BVAD support </plain></SENT>
