<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> parameters for the prediction of cardiovascular events in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-five HCM patients (52 males, 55.6 ± 14.8 years.) belonging to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I or II were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with the LV systolic dysfunction or a clinically documented history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined endpoints were HCM-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; admission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; new episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>; and worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms (NYHA class III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up period of 4.5 ± 1.7 years, 11 patients achieved the combined endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who experienced cardiovascular events had a larger LV size and left atrial volume compared with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic, early diastolic (e'), and late diastolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> velocities at the septal corner were lower in patients who experienced cardiovascular events; moreover, the septal E/e' value was higher in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate forward regression analysis revealed the deceleration times of E and the septal E/e' to be independent predictors of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Assessment of the diastolic function by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> is useful for risk stratification in HCM patients with no or mild symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> measurements should be incorporated into the clinical management of HCM </plain></SENT>
