<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, electrocardiographic abnormalities such as ST-segment elevation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventriculography reveals transient akinesis of the involved segment of the myocardial wall (usually the left ventricular apex) and compensatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002487'>hyperkinesis</z:hpo> of the noninvolved myocardium, which appears as apical ballooning during systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Existing criteria for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> include the absence of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous investigators have found incidental stenosis in only a minority of patients.Herein, we present the unusual case of an 84-year-old woman who sustained 4 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of the initial episode, coronary angiography revealed no substantial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with the 2nd episode, stenosis in the 1st obtuse marginal branch was treated with stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No new lesions were apparent after the patient's 3rd presentation, and the previously placed stent was patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 4th (current) presentation, we detected and percutaneously treated severe stenoses in the patient's left anterior descending coronary artery and 2nd obtuse marginal branch.Although this report is of a single patient only, it definitively illustrates that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> can occur in patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend the thorough evaluation of possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in high-risk patients, even upon the strong clinical suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
