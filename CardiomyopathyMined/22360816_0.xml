<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify electrocardiographic and clinical differences between patients with CAD with and without SCA, 87 victims of SCA with CAD were compared with 131 patients with CAD without SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' latest routine electrocardiograms and clinical variables were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAD with and without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (MIs) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with SCA had a higher incidence of echocardiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median left ventricular ejection fractions for patients with SCA with and without previous MIs were 0.30 (interquartile range 0.24 to 0.41) and 0.41 (interquartile range 0.25 to 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time between the last electrocardiographic assessment and SCA was 59 days (interquartile range 29 to 137) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding electrocardiographic characteristics, in patients with and without previous MIs, QRS width (odds ratio 1.032, 95% confidence interval 1.012 to 1.053, p = 0.002, and odds ratio 1.035, 95% confidence interval 1.015 to 1.056, p = 0.001) was the only significant predictor of SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with CAD, regardless of a previous MI, a longer QRS width and echocardiographic parameters consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are associated with SCA, even in patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> currently not eligible for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
