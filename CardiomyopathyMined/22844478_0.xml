<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi>, for example, represents 50% of total free amino acids in the heart, and in vivo studies have linked <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> deficiency with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four male Wistar rats (body weight = 100 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to one of two groups: Control (C) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>-deficient (T (-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16958">Beta-alanine</z:chebi> at a concentration of 3% was added to the animals' water to induce <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> deficiency in the T (-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 30, the rats were individually submitted to echocardiography; morphometrical and histopathological evaluation and metalloproteinase activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> evaluation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were collected to determine the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> concentration in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> deficiency led to decreases in: ventricular wall thickness, left ventricle dry weight, myocyte sectional area, left ventricle posterior wall thickness and ventricular geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to heart function, the velocity of the A wave, the ratio between the E and A wave, the ejection fraction, fractional shortening and cardiac output values were decreased in T (-) rats, suggesting abnormal diastolic and systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and increased activation of metalloproteinases were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was increased in deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> deficiency promotes structural and functional cardiac alterations with unique characteristics </plain></SENT>
