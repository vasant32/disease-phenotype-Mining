<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Urban tertiary care academic medical centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 129 subjects, 56 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), 34 with hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (H-LVH), 27 professional athletes with LVH (AT-LVH) and 12 healthy controls in sinus rhythm with preserved left ventricular systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional echocardiographic and tissue Doppler examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bi-dimensional acquisitions were analysed to map longitudinal systolic strain (automated function imaging, AFI, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) from apical views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with HCM had significantly lower regional and average global peak longitudinal systolic strain (GLS-avg) compared with controls and other forms of LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strain dispersion index, a measure of regional contractile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, was higher in HCM compared with the rest of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On receiver operator characteristics analysis, GLS-avg had excellent discriminatory ability to distinguish HCM from H-LVH area under curve (AUC) (0.893, p&lt;0.001) or AT-LVH AUC (0.920, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler and LV morphological parameters were better suited to differentiate the athlete heart from HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 2DS (AFI) allows rapid characterisation of regional and global systolic function and may have the potential to differentiate HCM from variant forms of LVH </plain></SENT>
