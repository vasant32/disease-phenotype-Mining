<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Because a close relationship between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) has been shown, the impact of functional, morphological and clinical parameters to identify potential determinants of EAT was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance parameters were determined and correlated to the amount of EAT in 158 patients with CAD and 40 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAD and left ventricular function (LVEF) ≥50% revealed significantly elevated EAT (36±11g/m²) compared to healthy controls (31±8g/m²) and to patients with LVEF &lt;50% (26±8.0g/m²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the whole study population, only LVEF (P=0.003), body mass index (BMI) (P=0.004) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LV-EDD) (P=0.004) remained significantly associated with EAT after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis in patients with CAD and LVEF ≥50% showed that BMI (P=0.03) was the only correlate of EAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with CAD and LVEF &lt;50%, indexed LV end diastolic mass (LV-EDMI) (P=0.003) and the extent of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE %) (P=0.03) remained significantly correlated with EAT in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The amount and the determinants of EAT differ according to the LVEF in patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, different amounts of EAT reflect different stages of CAD underlining the complex interaction of EAT in the pathogenesis and progression of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>.  (Circ J 2012; 76: 2426-2434) </plain></SENT>
