<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although false-positive electrocardiographic (ECG) results for HC are well recognized in athlete screening, expected false-negative rates are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the rate of false-negative ECG findings in a cohort of young asymptomatic patients with phenotypically expressed HC, defined by cardiovascular magnetic resonance, using the 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommended ECG criteria for the identification of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in trained athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance studies and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed in 114 consecutive asymptomatic patients with HC aged ≤35 years (mean age 22 ± 8 years; 77% male patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were analyzed to distinguish pathologic ECG patterns from alterations considered nonpathologic and physiologic consequences of athletic training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 114 patients with HC, 103 (90%) demonstrated ≥1 pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo>, while the remaining 11 patients (10%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or nonpathologic ECG patterns and therefore defined a subgroup in whom ECG screening would not be expected to raise suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (i.e., false-negative results) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this false-negative ECG results group, maximal left ventricular wall thickness was 17 ± 2 mm (range 15 to 21), compared to patients with pathologic ECG patterns, in whom maximal left ventricular wall thickness was 22 ± 5 mm (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a substantial minority of young asymptomatic patients with HC with phenotypically expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> have nonpathologic ECG findings on the basis of the 2010 European Society of Cardiology guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In principle, this high false-negative rate of 10% represents an important limitation in applying 12-lead electrocardiography to large, apparently healthy athletic populations for the detection of HC </plain></SENT>
