<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial performance index (MPI), or Tei index, is an indicator of systolic and diastolic myocardial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MPI increases in case of cardiac dysfunction; however, whether reversal of left ventricular dysfunction is also reflected by concomitant improvement (i.e., decrease) of MPI is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and viable myocardium by dobutamine stress echocardiography were studied by echocardiography before and more than 4 months after cardiac revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were in optimal medical therapy, which remained unchanged following revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, ejection fraction (EF: 32 ± 6%) and wall motion score index (WMSI: 2.37 ± 0.32) were impaired, and MPI averaged 0.71 ± 0.19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Revascularization markedly improved EF (44 ± 10%, P &lt; 0.0001) and WMSI (1.77 ± 0.44, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPI also improved (0.59 ± 0.26, P &lt; 0.0001), and its decrease was significantly correlated with the improvement in EF (r =-0.68, P &lt; 0.0001) and to the extent of viable myocardium (r =-0.45, P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responders to revascularization (≥5% increase in EF at follow-up, n = 40% and 77%) achieved a significant improvement in MPI at follow-up in contrast with nonresponders (-23 ± 25% vs. 0.02 ± 0.18%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement in MPI was largely driven by a significant reduction in isovolumic contraction time (P &lt; 0.001) with consequent prolongation of the ejection phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, MPI improves along with recovery of function, reflecting the intrinsic improvement of viable segments induced by revascularization </plain></SENT>
