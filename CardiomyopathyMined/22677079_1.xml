<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce pathologic structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emerging data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> training for and competing in extreme endurance events such as marathons, ultramarathons, ironman distance triathlons, and very long distance bicycle races, can cause transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> volume overload of the atria and right ventricle, with transient reductions in right ventricular ejection fraction and elevations of cardiac biomarkers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over months to years of repetitive injury, this process, in some individuals, may lead to patchy <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, particularly in the atria, interventricular septum, and right ventricle, creating a substrate for atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, long-term excessive sustained exercise may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo>, diastolic dysfunction, and large-artery wall stiffening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this concept is still hypothetical and there is some inconsistency in the reported findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lifelong vigorous exercisers generally have low mortality rates and excellent functional capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, the hypothesis that long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce adverse CV remodeling warrants further investigation to identify at-risk individuals and formulate physical fitness regimens for conferring optimal CV health and longevity </plain></SENT>
