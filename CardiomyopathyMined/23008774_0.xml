<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-related mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC)-L29Q and G159D-have shown diverse findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The link between such mutant effects and their divergent impact on cardiac phenotypes has remained elusive due to lack of studies on contractile dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a cTnC mutant-induced change in the thin filament will affect global myofilament mechanodynamics because of the interactions of thin filament kinetics with both Ca(2+) binding and crossbridge (XB) cycling kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured pCa-tension relationship and contractile dynamics in detergent-skinned rat cardiac papillary muscle fibers reconstituted with the recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> rat cTnC (cTnC(WT)), cTnC(L29Q), and cTnC(G159D) mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cTnC(L29Q) fibers demonstrated a significant decrease in Ca(2+) sensitivity, but cTnC(G159D) fibers did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both mutants had no effect on Ca(2+)-activated maximal tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of XB recruitment dynamics increased in cTnC(L29Q) (26%) and cTnC(G159D) (25%) fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of XB distortion dynamics increased in cTnC(G159D) fibers (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cTnC(L29Q) mutant modulates the equilibrium between the non-cycling and cycling pool of XB by affecting the on/off kinetics of the regulatory units (Tropomyosin-Troponin); whereas, the cTnC(G159D) mutant increases XB cycling rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different effects on contractile dynamics may offer clue regarding how cTnC(L29Q) and cTnC(G159D) cause divergent effects on cardiac phenotypes </plain></SENT>
