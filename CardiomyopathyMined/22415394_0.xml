<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been classified as a genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms of ILVNC have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> among familial forms, although sarcomeric mutations are the most common genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Issues related to familial screening require careful consideration and future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is considerable controversy regarding several aspects relating to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of subjects with ILVNC </plain></SENT>
