<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study this relationship using a comprehensive molecular analysis detecting BBSL in EMB samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular analysis targeting cardiotropic viruses and BBSL in EMB specimens of 41 individuals with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and 15 controls with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, quantitative PCR and electron microscopy of EMB specimens were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, autoantibodies and manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were evaluated in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> presented more frequently with myocardial BBSL persistence as compared with the control group (24% vs. 0%, P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the prevalence of parvovirus B19 and cytomegalovirus was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of borrelial DNA revealed the following genospecies: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in three patients (30%), Borrelia afzelii in two patients (20%), and Borrelia garinii in four patients (40%), the results being inconclusive in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BBSL-positive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients had a higher prevalence of organ-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> in comparison with the remaining <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients (50% vs. 16%, P = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Myocardial persistence of BBSL may be involved in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in individuals living in areas in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lyme disease</z:e> is endemic </plain></SENT>
