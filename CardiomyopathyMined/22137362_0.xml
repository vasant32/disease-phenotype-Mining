<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To observe the dynamic expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in myocardium of diabetic rats and explore its role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups including control, diabetic-4 weeks, diabetic-8 weeks and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> treatment groups (240 μM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> in drinking water) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) models were established by intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ, 30 mg/kg) after high-fat and high-sugar diet for one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic parameters were measured, cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was observed by electron microscope and HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was detected by laser-scanning confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyzed the expression of CaSR, protein kinase C α(PKC-α) and calcium handling regulators, such as phospholamban (PLN), Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, [Ca(2+)](i) and the expression of CaSR, RyR and SERCA/PLN were decreased, while PKC-α and PLN were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in diabetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile diabetic rats displayed abnormal cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> (CaSR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) could prevent or slow its progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the CaSR expression of myocardium is reduced in the progress of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and its potential mechanism is related to the impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis </plain></SENT>
