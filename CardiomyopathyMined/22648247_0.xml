<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat measurements of brain natiuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels should be helpful in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To distinguish <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> from peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> the time of manifestation should be considered </plain></SENT>
