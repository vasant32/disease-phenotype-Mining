<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, these patients are prone to develop life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which are amongst their most frequent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data regarding risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, however, are scarce due to the rareness of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, even invasive electrophysiological studies may be of limited value in this regard in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) have been demonstrated to be highly effective for the prevention of sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in IVNC and should be considered in patients who are clinically judged to be at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include patients with a severely reduced ejection fraction as well as those with a prior history of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, or a family history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings in patients with IVNC and discusses possibilities for risk stratification as well as the rationale for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
