<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We prospectively applied the Surgical Treatment of Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> trial entry criteria to an observational database to determine whether coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) decreases mortality compared with medical therapy (MED) for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study of prospectively collected data from the Duke Databank for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term mortality was the main outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between January 1, 1995, and July 31, 2009, 86,874 patients underwent cardiac catheterization for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and were evaluated for inclusion in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,624 patients were found to have left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.35, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> amenable to CABG, and no left main stenosis of greater than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After exclusions including ongoing Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 763 patients were included for propensity score analysis, including 624 who received MED and 139 who underwent CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted mortality curves were constructed for those patients in the three quintiles most likely to receive CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The curves diverged early, with risk-adjusted mortality rates at 5 years of 46% for MED versus 29% for CABG, and the survival benefit of CABG over MED continued through 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among a propensity-matched, risk-adjusted, observational cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.35, and no left main disease of greater than 50%, CABG is associated with a survival advantage over MED through 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
