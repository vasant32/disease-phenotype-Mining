<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by maladaptive remodeling of cardiomyocytes, extracellular collagen matrix (ECCM) and left ventricular (LV) geometry which contributes to further dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV assist devices (LVADs) can reverse adverse remodeling in end-stage <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is a disconnect between the benefits of prolonged unloading with LVAD at molecular and cellular levels and the low rate of bridge to recovery (BTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential explanations for this paradox include insufficient reverse ECCM remodeling and/or excessive reverse cardiomyocyte remodeling with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LVAD therapy is associated with decreased collagen turnover and cross-linking and increased tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>), whereas LVAD combined with angiotensin-converting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> results in decreased tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> and collagen cross-linking, normalizes LV end-diastolic pressure volume relationships and is associated with modestly higher rates of BTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Much remains to be learned about ventricular reverse remodeling after LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This can be facilitated through systematic collection and comparison of recovered and unrecovered myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, vigilant monitoring for ventricular recovery among LVAD patients is needed, particularly in older patients receiving LVAD for destination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, prospective multicenter trials are needed to clarify the potential benefit of concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy with selective Î²2 agonism on ventricular recovery </plain></SENT>
