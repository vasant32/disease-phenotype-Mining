<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 2 million people participate in long-distance running races in the United States annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports of race-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo> have generated concern about the safety of this activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the incidence and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> associated with marathon and half-marathon races in the United States from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the clinical characteristics of the arrests by interviewing survivors and the next of kin of nonsurvivors, reviewing medical records, and analyzing postmortem data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10.9 million runners, 59 (mean [Â±SD] age, 42-13 years; 51 men) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (incidence rate, 0.54 per 100,000 participants; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> accounted for the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate was significantly higher during marathons (1.01 per 100,000; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.38) than during half-marathons (0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.43) and among men (0.90 per 100,000; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.18) than among women (0.16; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male marathon runners, the highest-risk group, had an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during the latter half of the study decade (2000-2004, 0.71 per 100,000 [95% CI, 0.31 to 1.40]; 2005-2010, 2.03 per 100,000 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.98]; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, 42 (71%) were fatal (incidence, 0.39 per 100,000; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 31 cases with complete clinical data, initiation of bystander-administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an underlying diagnosis other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were the strongest predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Marathons and half-marathons are associated with a low overall risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>Cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, most commonly attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, occurs primarily among male marathon participants; the incidence rate in this group increased during the past decade </plain></SENT>
