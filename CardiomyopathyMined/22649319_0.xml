<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well established that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> induces a hyperdynamic cardiovascular state, which is associated with a faster heart rate, enhanced left ventricular systolic and diastolic function whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> is characterized by the opposite changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>Hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> represent opposite clinical conditions, albeit not mirror images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested the involvement of ROS tissue damage under altered thyroid status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altered-thyroid state-linked changes in heart modify their susceptibility to oxidants and the extent of the oxidative damage they suffer following oxidative challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> increase in the cellular levels of ROS can lead to a catastrophic cycle of DNA damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, further ROS generation and cellular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, these cellular events might play an important role in the development and progression of myocardial remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in altered thyroid states (hypo- and hyper-thyroidism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present review aims at elucidating the various signaling pathways mediated via ROS and their modulation under altered thyroid state and the possibility of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
