<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: The study involved a 10-year retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with LM, with a search of a diagnosis database using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and either <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and of a pathology database for biopsy-proved LM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: Twenty-four patients met the study criteria, with 79% female and 82% white (age: mean (SD), 47.6 (20.4) years; follow-up: mean (SD), 9.2 (6.1) months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of antibodies SS-A (69%) and anti-RNP (62%) was greater than in published <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> populations (25%-40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On echocardiography, the mean initial left ventricular ejection fraction was 33.8%, improving to 49.5% after a mean of 7.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received immunosuppression, most with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment and subsequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> taper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died of cardiogenic shock during hospitalization; two patients died within one year posthospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: A high index of suspicion is necessary in suspected LM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher frequency of elevated SS-A and anti-RNP antibody levels in our series than in the literature is suggestive of an LM association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is a useful initial investigation for LM, but patients should be referred early for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or endomyocardial biopsy to confirm diagnosis if it is clinically indicated in difficult cases </plain></SENT>
