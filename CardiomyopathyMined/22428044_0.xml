<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both bone marrow (BM) and myocardium contain progenitor cells expressing the c-Kit tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the effects of c-Kit mutations on: i. myocardial c-Kit(+) cells counts and ii. the stability of left ventricular (LV) contractile function and structure during aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV structure and contractile function were evaluated (echocardiography) in two groups of Kit mutant (W/Wv and W41/W42) and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) mice at 4 and 12 months of age and the effects of the mutations on LV mass, vascular density and the numbers of proliferating cells were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 month old Kit mutant and WT mice, LV ejection fractions (EF) and LV fractional shortening rates (FS) were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12 months of age EF and FS were significantly decreased and LV mass was significantly increased only in W41/W42 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial vascular densities and c-Kit(+) cell numbers were significantly reduced in both mutant groups when compared to WT hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replacement of mutant BM with WT BM at 4 months of age did not prevent these abnormalities in either mutant group although they were somewhat attenuated in the W/Wv group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably BM transplantation did not prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 12 month W41/W42 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that decreased numbers and functional capacities of c-Kit(+) cardiac resident progenitor cells may be the basis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in W41/W42 mice and although defects in mutant BM progenitor cells may prove to be contributory, they are not causal </plain></SENT>
