<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: HTCMREF on serial echocardiography has distinctive points as compared to idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (idDCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 18 hypertensive patients (mean age, 63 ± 13 years, 56% women) admitted with severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters at admission and follow-up between the patients with HTCMREF and 18 age-matched patients with idDCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular mass (LVM) and left atrial volume (LAV) were calculated by a formula using echocardiographic measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In HTCMREF, left ventricular ejection fraction improved to 52.3 ± 8.8% during a mean follow-up of 574 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HTCMREF, initial left atrial diameter was greater than in idDCM (43.6 ± 5.8 mm vs 38.9 ± 6.3, p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, LAV index decreased in HTCMREF (from 31.9 ± 8.3 mL/m(2) to 21.0 ± 8.9, P &lt; 0.001), as opposed to a significant increase in idDCM (from 28.5 ± 10.9 mL/m(2) to 31.9 ± 8.3, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in initial LVM index between the 2 groups, but only in HTCMREF did LVM index decrease significantly (151.4 ± 42.1 g/m(2) from 192.2 ± 43.7, P &lt; 0.01) at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In HTCMREF, LV wall on M-mode was thicker than in idDCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with severe LV systolic dysfunction might be characterized by eccentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008726'>enlarged left atrium</z:mp> in comparison with idDCM </plain></SENT>
