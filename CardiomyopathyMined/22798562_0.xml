<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AimsArrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart muscle disorder</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathophysiology is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to produce an in vitro cellular model of ARVC using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and determine whether the model could recapitulate key features of the disease phenotype.Methods and resultsDermal fibroblasts were obtained from a 30-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC, harbouring a plakophilin 2 (PKP2) gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four stable iPSC lines were generated using retroviral reprogramming, and functional cardiomyocytes were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression levels of desmosomal proteins (PKP2 and plakoglobin) in cardiomyocytes from ARVC-iPSCs were significantly lower compared with cardiomyocytes from control iPSCs (P&lt; 0.01); there were no significant differences in the expression of desmoplakin, N-cadherin, and connexin 43 between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes derived from ARVC-iPSCs exhibited markedly reduced immunofluorescence signals when stained for PKP2 and plakoglobin, but similar levels of staining for desmoplakin, N-cadherin, and connexin 43 compared with control cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy showed that ARVC-iPSC cardiomyocytes were larger and contained darker <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets compared with control cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of cell exposure to adiopgenic differentiation medium, ARVC-iPSC cardiomyocytes were found to contain a significantly greater amount of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, calculated using Oil Red O staining, compared with controls (734 ± 35.6 vs. 8.1 ± 0.49 a.u., respectively; n = 7, P = 0.001).ConclusionPatient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes display key features of ARVC, including reduced cell surface localization of desmosomal proteins and a more adipogenic phenotype </plain></SENT>
