<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ECG revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006671'>paroxysmal atrial tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) with a cycle length of 260 ms and the P wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the AT was similar to that during sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No rejection, vasculopathy, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation guided by a noncontact mapping system were performed due to drug refractory AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AT was induced spontaneously by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activation sequence of the AT exhibited a focal pattern, and the breakout site of the AT into the donor right atrium was just 12 mm below the breakout site of the donor sinoatrial node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency catheter ablation eliminated this AT and resulted in an improvement in the symptoms </plain></SENT>
