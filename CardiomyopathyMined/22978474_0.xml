<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Aim: To describe the natural history, management and outcomes of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (PPCM) in an unselected Northern European population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: A retrospective single-centre observational study was performed at a tertiary referral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and transplantation unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes measured were baseline demographics, clinical presentation, course and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings were compared at baseline, two and six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: 12 cases of PPCM were identified between 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 34.7years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were multiparous and nine had pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten presented in the first week postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two required inotropic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean ejection fraction at presentation was 27.1% (SD-8.2%) which improved to 47.1% (SD-13.2%) at six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this time ten patients were asymptomatic and six had recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) function improved but did not reach <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One case with persistent severe LV dysfunction required cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered an arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> several years after the six month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: PPCM is a rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With appropriate therapy, a good clinical outcome is common but not universal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Continued deterioration requiring ventricular support and cardiac transplantation can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, older maternal age, multiparity and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> appeared to be risk factors </plain></SENT>
