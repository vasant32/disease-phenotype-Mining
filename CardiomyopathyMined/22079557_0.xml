<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective evaluation of electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters was to identify predictive parameters for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred two patients undergoing first CRT implantation were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic response was defined as improvement in New York Heart Association functional class of at least 1 class within 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve-lead ECG of the intrinsic rhythm during biventricular (BIV), right ventricular (RV), and left ventricular (LV) pacing was obtained and analyzed in terms of QRS width and QRS axis (Datinf Measure Software, Datinf GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 77.5% (n = 79) of patients fulfilled the predefined clinical criterion for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were more likely to respond to CRT than were patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (85% vs 71.8%, P = .034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shorter QRS duration during LV pacing and, in particular, a shorter LV paced than RV paced QRS width were strong and independent predictors for response (-20.13 ± 33.2 ms in responders vs 6.05 ± 27.3 ms in nonresponders, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found in RV and BIV paced QRS width or in QRS axis (P &gt;.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study describes novel and easily obtainable ECG measurements that can be performed during LV lead positioning to optimize clinical outcome of CRT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
