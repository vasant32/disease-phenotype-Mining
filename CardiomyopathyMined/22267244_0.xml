<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of cTn in peripheral blood indicates cardiomyocyte damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) is the most important cause of cardiomyocyte damage, cTns have become an integral part in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this indication, cTns are superior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other biomarkers and therefore are the preferred marker for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, cTn indicates and provides an estimate of cardiomyocyte damage irrespective of its cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major limitation of contemporary cTn assays is that they are often not elevated during the initial hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in assay technology have led to more sensitive and precise cTn assays that will have a profound impact on clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-sensitive cTn (hs-cTn) assays have two differentiating features from contemporary cTn assays: (i) detection of cTn in a majority of healthy persons and (ii) precise definition of what is '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' (=the 99th percentile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent multicentre studies have shown that hs-cTn assays improve the early diagnosis of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, particularly the early rule-out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To achieve best clinical use, cTn has to be interpreted as a quantitative variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rising and/or falling levels differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiomyocyte damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The terms 'troponin-positive' and 'troponin negative' should therefore be avoided. 'Detectable' levels will become the norm and will have to be differentiated from 'elevated' levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of a small amount of cardiomyocyte damage and therefore minor elevations of cTn is broad and includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of larger amount of injury and therefore more substantial elevations of cTn is largely restricted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, and a rare patient with tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
