<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A nasal swab was found to be positive for H1N1 making peripartum and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, the most likely differential diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT coronary angiography and subsequent invasive angiography revealed an anomalous coronary system thus making ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> also a possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac MRI played a vital role in identifying the underlying cause, which in this case was that of H1N1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
