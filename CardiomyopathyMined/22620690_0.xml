<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: 30 healthy cats without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> on echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cats underwent echocardiographic examination, the findings of which were reviewed by a board-certified cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cats that struggled (n = 10) received mild sedation with butorphanol and midazolam IM to permit phlebotomy without interruption in jugular venous blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected for analysis of thromboelastography variables, PCV, total solids concentration, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 thromboelastography variables had &lt; 5% mean intra-assay variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean values were as follows: reaction time, 4.3 minutes; clotting time, 1.6 minutes; α angle, 66.5°; and maximum amplitude, 56.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonsedated cats, cats that required sedation had a significantly shorter clotting time and greater α angle, whereas reaction time and maximum amplitude were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Kaolin-activated thromboelastography was a reliable test with unremarkable intra-assay variability in echocardiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sedation may affect certain thromboelastography variables, but the effect is unlikely to be clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has a significant effect on thromboelastography variables in cats </plain></SENT>
