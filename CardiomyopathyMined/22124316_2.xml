<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in five genes that encode major components of the desmosomes, namely junction plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, desmoglein-2, and desmocollin-2, have been identified in approximately half of affected probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AC is, therefore, commonly considered a 'desmosomal' disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No single test is sufficiently specific to establish a diagnosis of AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for AC were revised in 2010 to improve sensitivity, but maintain specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative parameters were introduced and identification of a pathogenic mutation in a first-degree relative has become a major diagnostic criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caution in the interpretation of screening results is highly recommended because a 'pathogenic' mutation is difficult to define </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental data confirm that this genetically determined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> develops after birth because of progressive myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, and is initiated by <z:mp ids='MP_0010632'>cardiomyocyte necrosis</z:mp>; cellular and animal models are necessary to gain insight into the cascade of underlying molecular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Crosstalk from the desmosome to the nucleus, gap junctions, and ion channels is under investigation, to move from symptomatic to targeted therapy, with the ultimate aim to stop disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression </plain></SENT>
