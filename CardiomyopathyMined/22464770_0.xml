<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Familial involvement is common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and &gt;40 genes have been implicated in causing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of genetic testing in clinical practice is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the experience of clinical genetic testing in a diverse <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> population to characterize the prevalence and predictors of gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 264 unrelated adult and pediatric <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> index patients referred to 1 reference lab for clinical genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to 10 genes were analyzed (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYBPC3, ACTC, LMNA, PLN, TAZ, and LDB3), and 70% of patients were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 26.6 Â± 21.3 years, and 52% had a family history of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rigorous criteria were used to classify DNA variants as clinically relevant (mutations), variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS), or presumed benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations were found in 17.4% of patients, commonly involving MYH7, LMNA, or TNNT2 (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional 10.6% of patients had VUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing was rarely positive in older patients without a family history of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely in pediatric patients, family history did not increase the sensitivity of genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using rigorous criteria for classifying DNA variants, mutations were identified in 17% of a diverse group of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> index patients referred for clinical genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low sensitivity of genetic testing in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> reflects limitations in both current methodology and knowledge of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, if mutations are identified, genetic testing can help guide family management </plain></SENT>
