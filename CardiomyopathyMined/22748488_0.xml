<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was intended to investigate whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) could predict the recovery of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">DCMP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between July 2001 and March 2009, 107 patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">DCMP</z:chebi> underwent radionuclide angiography to assess their CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recovery of LV systolic dysfunction was defined as recovery of the ejection fraction (EF) measured by transthoracic echocardiography to a level of 40% or greater and an increase of 10% or greater in its absolute value during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EF was followed for at least 36 months if it did not recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (31.8%) recovered and had greater CBF than the nonrecovered patients (41.9 ± 3.4 vs. 37.1 ± 4.9 mL/min/100g, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic analysis, CBF (odds ratio 1.216) and symptom duration (odds ratio 0.952) were independent predictors of the recovery of LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a weak negative correlation between CBF and symptom duration (r = -0.334, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CBF was associated with LVEF improvement seen at the 1- and 2-year follow-up times according to multiple linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBF was associated with recovery of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">DCMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, measurement of CBF would be helpful to predict the clinical course of their disease </plain></SENT>
