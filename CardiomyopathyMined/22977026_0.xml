<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From these data, a specific postprocessing procedure provides two kinds of metrics: (a) three orthogonal components of myocardial motion (longitudinal, circumferential, and radial), and (b) rotation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strain expresses the local myocardial deformation and is prone to important physiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic strain is in the range of -15% to -20% for the longitudinal and circumferential components (fiber shortening) and 30%-40% for the radial component (wall thickening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The helical arrangement of myofibers that run in opposite directions at the epicardium and endocardium explains systolic twist (∼15°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> may be enhanced during the early stage of several diseases (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strain is generally impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but the most diagnostically significant finding is the early identification of contractile dysfunction on the basis of longitudinal and circumferential strain reduction in patients with apparently preserved systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, strain impairment appears to be a sensitive and promising marker of subclinical disease, with the potential for improving patient management. © RSNA, 2012 </plain></SENT>
