<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although systolic dysfunction is common, limited information is available on differences in wall motion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compacted and noncompacted segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess radial wall motion and longitudinal wall velocity in patients with NCCM, according to the extent and severity of noncompaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study comprised 29 patients in sinus rhythm (age 41 ± 15 years, 15 men), who fulfilled stringent diagnostic criteria for NCCM and compared to 29 age and gender matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segmental radial wall motion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compacted and noncompacted segments was assessed with the standard visual wall motion score index and longitudinal systolic (Sm) wall velocity with tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each LV wall a normalized Sm value was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent and severity of NC in each LV segment was assessed both in a qualitative and quantitative manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was the primary clinical presentation in half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NCCM patients had a wall motion score index of 1.68 ± 0.43 and a normalized Sm of 82 ± 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total and maximal noncompaction scores were not related to the wall motion score index and the normalized Sm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NCCM patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> had similar total and maximal noncompaction scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In NCCM patient's radial wall motion and longitudinal LV wall velocity is impaired but not related to the extent or severity of noncompaction </plain></SENT>
