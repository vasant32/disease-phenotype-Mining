<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred and thirty-two patients with severe functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and systolic dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 0.32 ± 0.078) underwent mitral surgery in the same time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the preoperative echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MV repair group (0.308 ± 0.077 vs 0.336 ± 0.076, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 2.3% for MV repair and 12.5% for MV replacement (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 ± 3.2% for MV repair and 73 ± 7.9% for MV replacement (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 ± 0.077 to 0.382 ± 0.095, p &lt; 0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the MV replacement group LVEF did not significantly change (from 0.336 ± 0.076 to 0.31 ± 0.11, p = 0.56) and the reduction of LV dimensions was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement was identified as the only predictor of hospital (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced dilated and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and severe functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, MV replacement is associated with higher in-hospital and late mortality compared with MV repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mitral repair should be preferred whenever possible in this clinical setting </plain></SENT>
