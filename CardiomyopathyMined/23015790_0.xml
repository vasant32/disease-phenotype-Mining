<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVD/C) was the previous name of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, similar histopathologic changes are also found in the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AC is also considered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent molecular genetic studies provide accumulating evidence that fibrofatty replacement is preceded by mutation-related desmosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Desmosomal dysfunction may lead to mechanical and thereafter electrical uncoupling, ultimately resulting in conduction delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This activation delay and conduction block, provide a substrate for re-entrant mechanisms and thereby <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gold standard for AC diagnosis is demonstration of transmural fibrofatty replacement in cardiac tissue obtained by autopsy or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To facilitate diagnosis in clinical practice, an international Task Force defined in 1994 a set of criteria (TFC) based on electrocardiographic, functional and morphologic features, and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These criteria have recently been revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine 12-lead electrocardiography is one of the most important tools for AC diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even in the absence of other markers in the early concealed stage of the disease, in line with early slow conduction and electrical uncoupling ECG analysis may contribute to early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Activation delay and site of origin of VT are reflected in various characteristics of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since the ECG is easy to obtain, this technique is particularly useful, for both diagnosis and follow up of disease progression </plain></SENT>
