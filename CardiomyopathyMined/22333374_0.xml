<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At cardiac catheterization, pressure study showed that there was a markedly high pressure-gradient of 90 mmHg between the apex and the base in systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apical pressure was 350 mmHg after <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was already dilated and spherical in late systole; the absence of active relaxation was considered to be the cause of the paradoxic jet flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, we suggest the pathogenesis of left ventricular apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and paradoxic jet flow in MVOHCM </plain></SENT>
