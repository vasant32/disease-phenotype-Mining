<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are pivotal treatment options for patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite robust left ventricular unloading, the right ventricle remains unsupported and susceptible to hemodynamic perturbations from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the epidemiology, management, resource use, and outcomes of sustained VAs in continuous-flow LVAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients receiving a continuous-flow LVAD at the University of North Carolina from January 2006 to February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, pharmacotherapies, resource use, and outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were generated, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the independent association of clinical variables on the development of postimplantation VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 61 patients, 26 (43%) had sustained VAs after LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most were male (65%), had history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (65%), and had nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with VAs after LVAD more often had preimplant VAs (62% vs 14%, P &lt; .01), prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (92% vs 71%, P = .04), and history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge (38% vs 11%, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although length of stay was similar, those with postimplant VAs had greater rehospitalization rates, greater antiarrhythmic drug use, and frequently required external defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable logistic regression, only history of prior VA was associated with postimplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (odds ratio 13.7, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in LVAD patients are common, often refractory to conservative therapy, and associated with frequent rehospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-LVAD VAs, however, did not significantly impact survival or transplantation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden should be considered before LVAD placement, and future study should focus on the impact of VAs on quality of life </plain></SENT>
