<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> required AV node ablation which rendered the patient pacemaker dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, recurrent episodes of dizziness occurred caused by inhibition of pacing due to oversensing of pectoral muscle myopotentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical revision was performed and the intraoperative examination revealed an intact integrated bipolar defibrillator lead with appropriate connections to the CRT-D header </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The placement of an additional pace/sense lead completely resolved the patient's symptoms and no further myopotential oversensing was recorded </plain></SENT>
