<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyse the value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived myocardial parameters to differentiate left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVNC) from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 12 patients with LVNC, 11 with dilated and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and compared them to 24 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LVNC patients had to fulfil standard echocardiographic criteria as well as additional clinical and imaging criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cine steady-state free precession and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) imaging was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total LV myocardial mass index (LV-MMI), compacted (LV-MMI(compacted)), non-compacted (LV-MMI(non-compacted)), percentage LV-MM(non-compacted), ventricular volumes and function were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were compared using analysis of variance and Dunnett's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, semi-quantitative segmental analyses of the occurrence of increased trabeculation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total LV-MMI(non-compacted) and percentage LV-MM(non-compacted) were discriminators between patients with LVCN, healthy controls and those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> with cut-offs of 15 g/m(2) and 25 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, trabeculation in basal segments and a ratio of non-compacted/compacted myocardium of ≥3:1 were criteria for LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of these criteria provided sensitivities and specificities of up to 100 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the LVNC patients demonstrated LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Absolute CMR quantification of the LV-MMI(non-compacted) or the percentage LV-MM(non-compacted) and increased trabeculation in basal segments allows one to reliably diagnose LVNC and to differentiate it from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS : • Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can reliably diagnose left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>. • Differentiation of LVNC from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts is possible. • The best diagnostic performance can be achieved if combined MRI criteria for the diagnosis are used </plain></SENT>
