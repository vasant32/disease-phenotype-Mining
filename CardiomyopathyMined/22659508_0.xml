<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, NecroXs, novel class of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi> scavengers, were evaluated for cardioprotection in in vitro and in vivo model, and the putative mechanism of the cardioprotection of NecroX-7 was investigated by global gene expression profiling and subsequent biochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NecroX-7 prevented <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (tBHP)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes at EC(50)=0.057 Î¼M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in rats, NecroX-7 significantly reduced the plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK-MB) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) which were increased by DOX treatment (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis revealed that 21 genes differentially expressed in tBHP-treated H9C2 cells were involved in 'Production of reactive oxygen species' (p=0.022), and they were resolved by concurrent NecroX-7 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-to-gene networking also identified that NecroX-7 relieved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through Ncf1/p47phox and Rac2 modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subsequent biochemical analysis, NecroX-7 inhibited <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase (NOX) activity by 53.3% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that NecroX-7, in part, provides substantial protection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> induced by tBHP or DOX via NOX-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
