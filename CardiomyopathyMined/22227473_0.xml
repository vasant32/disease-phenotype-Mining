<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations and/or loss of critical components in these macromolecular structures are increasingly being associated with arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>; however, their specific roles have been primarily attributed to effects within the working (ventricular) cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence also points to a key role for anchoring cell-cell junction components in cardiac muscle cells of the cardiac conduction system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is not only evidenced by the molecular and ultra-structural presence of anchoring cell junctions in specific compartments/structures of the cardiac conduction system (sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system), but also because conduction system-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be found in humans and mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> harboring defects and/or mutations in key anchoring cell-cell junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies emphasize the clinical need to understand the molecular and cellular role(s) for anchoring cell-cell junctions in cardiac conduction system function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on (i) experimental findings that underline an important role for anchoring cell-cell junctions in the cardiac conduction system, (ii) insights regarding involvement of these structures in age-related cardiac remodeling of the conduction system, (iii) summarizing available genetic mouse models that can target cardiac conduction system structures and (iv) implications of these findings on future therapies for arrhythmogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
