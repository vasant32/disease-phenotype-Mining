<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the phenotype and natural history of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> genetic subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) caused by a p.S358L mutation in TMEM43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of cardiac symptoms, clinical events and test abnormalities were studied in 412 subjects (258 affected, 154 unaffected), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which occurred in affected males significantly earlier, and more often than unaffected males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected males were hospitalised four times more often than affected females (p≤ 0.0001) and died younger (p≤0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporal sequence from symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was prolonged in affected females by 1-2 decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent ECG manifestation was poor R wave progression (PRWP), with affected males twice as likely to develop PRWP as affected females (p≤ 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular enlargement occurred in 43% of affected subjects, with 11% fulfilling criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor was common and occurred early: the most diagnostically useful clinical test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No symptom or test could rule out diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This ARVC subtype is a sex influenced lethal arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with a unique ECG finding, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, where molecular pre- symptomatic diagnosis has the greatest clinical utility </plain></SENT>
