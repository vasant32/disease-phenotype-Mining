<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement was suspected in initial publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now systematically analyzed the association of the FHL1 genotype with the cardiac phenotype to establish a potential cardiac involvement in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -Seventeen male patients and 23 female mutation carriers were compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every patient underwent a comprehensive clinical and cardiovascular workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> occurred frequently in affected males and were less frequent in heterozygous females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both male and female mutation carriers had increased myocardial mass (affected males=115.1±25.3 g/m2; heterozygous females=95.1±19.6 g/m2; controls: 89.0 ±15.6 g/m2 and 72.6±12.6 g/m2; respectively) with increased wall thickness (typically midventricular and apical segments) mainly in affected males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal systolic function was reduced in affected males (radial systolic strain: affected males=24.6±11.8%; male controls=43.2±14.8%; p = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction occurred in both affected males and heterozygous females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac MRI revealed a morphological hallmark of XMPMA: a characteristic spongious structure and replacement <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> indicated by late enhancement, could be detected in most affected males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>XMPMA was associated with reduced exercise capacity in affected males but not in heterozygous female mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -XMPMA patients consistently showed electrical, functional and characteristic morphological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> that translate into reduced exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reduced systolic and diastolic function is associated with a novel type of spongious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was that some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were also present in heterozygous female mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
