<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to establish reference parameters to identify functional effects of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-related point mutations in the β-cardiac/slow skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (β-cardiac/MyHC-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined mechanical and kinetic parameters of the β-cardiac/MyHC-1 using human soleus muscle fibers that express the same myosin heavy chain (MyHC-1) as ventricular myocardium (β-cardiac) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed parameters are compared to previously reported data for rabbit psoas muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the examined kinetic parameters to be slower in soleus fibers than in rabbit psoas muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Somewhat surprisingly, however, we also found that the stiffness of the β-cardiac/MyHC-1 head domain is more than 3-fold lower than the stiffness of the fast isoform of psoas fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, and different from rabbit psoas muscle, in human soleus fibers both the occupancy of force-generating cross-bridge states as well as the elastic extension of force-generating heads increase with temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a myosin head in the force generating states makes an increasing contribution to force with temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We support some of our fiber data by data from in vitro motility and optical trapping assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial findings with FHC-related point mutations in the converter imply that the differences in stiffness of the head domain between the slow and fast isoform may well be due to particular differences in the amino acid sequence of the converter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show that the slower kinetics may be linked to a larger flexibility of the β-cardiac/MyHC-1 isoform compared to fast MyHC isoforms </plain></SENT>
