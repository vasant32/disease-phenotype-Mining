<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1993 guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan have been used as the diagnostic gold standard and for comparison with imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG PET is not currently included in the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, studies have shown promising data using (18)F-FDG PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated the accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> compared with MHLW guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from a prospective Ontario provincial registry are also reported and included in the metaanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies that satisfied predetermined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quality evaluation using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies was performed by 2 independent masked observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted and analyzed to measure study-specific and pooled accuracy for (18)F-FDG PET compared with the MHLW as the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 519 titles was identified; 7 studies, including the Ontario registry, were selected for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Metaanalysis of these 7 studies was conducted, with a total of 164 patients, most of whom had been diagnosed with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> was 50% in the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pooled estimates for (18)F-FDG PET yielded 89% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 79%-96%), 78% specificity (95% CI, 68%-86%), a 4.1 positive likelihood ratio (95% CI, 1.7-10), and a 0.19 negative likelihood ratio (95% CI, 0.1-0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall diagnostic odds ratio was 25.6 (95% CI, 7.3-89.5), and the area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve was 93% Â± 3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Ontario study yielded sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high diagnostic accuracy determined for (18)F-FDG PET in this metaanalysis suggests potential value for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> compared with the MHLW guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results may affect patient care by providing supportive evidence for more effective use of (18)F-FDG PET in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Large-scale multicenter studies are required to further evaluate this role </plain></SENT>
