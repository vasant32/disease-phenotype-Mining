<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although Friedreich <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (FA) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, the severity and evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify factors predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in FA, we assessed echocardiograms from a large heterogenous cohort and their relation to disease traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most recent echocardiograms from 173 subjects with FA were analyzed in a core laboratory to determine their relation to disease duration, subject age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, functional disability score, and GAA repeat length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the cohort was 19.7 years, mean age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 10.6 years, and mean shorter GAA length was 681 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms collectively illustrated systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> correlated moderately with each other (r = 0.39 to 0.79) but not with measurements of diastolic dysfunction (r &lt;0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diastolic measurements correlated poorly with each other, although 26% of the cohort had multiple diastolic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common diastolic dysfunction classification was pseudonormalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Classification of diastolic dysfunction was predicted by GAA repeat length but not by age or gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction was below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 20% of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In linear regression analysis, increasing age predicted decreasing ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional disability score, a measurement of neurologic ability, did not predict any echocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and diastolic and systolic dysfunctions occur in FA and are substantially independent; diastolic dysfunction is the most common abnormality with most patients having an assigned diastolic dysfunction class of pseudonormalization </plain></SENT>
