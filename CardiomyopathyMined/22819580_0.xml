<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A consecutive series of 40 patients from a single institution were recruited with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC based on the diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent systematic clinical evaluation, including history and examination, electrocardiography, 24-h Holter monitor, chest radiography, echocardiography and CMR examination and were divided into two groups according to the QRS dispersion: group I, QRS dispersion ≥40 ms; group II, QRS dispersion &lt;40 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the characteristic parameters of CMR image and QRS dispersion were analyzed in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in QRS dispersion (57±14 ms vs. 26±11 ms), right ventricular end-diastolic diameter (57±10 mm vs. 48±11 mm, P=.012), right ventricular end-systolic diameter (52±10 mm vs. 44±11 mm, P=.010), right ventricular end-diastolic volume (260±105 ml vs. 180±66 ml, P=.006), right ventricular end-systolic volume (222±98 ml vs. 148±61 ml, P=.006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> detection rate (74% vs. 38%, P=.024) between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ARVC, QRS dispersion and right ventricular end-diastolic volume (r=0.66, P&lt;.001), right ventricular end-systolic volume (r=0.67, P&lt;.001), right ventricular outflow tract area (r=0.68, P&lt;.001) showed a moderate positive correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular outflow tract area, right ventricular end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume detected by CMR in patients with ARVC were positively correlated to the extent of QRS dispersion (≥40 ms), the strongest independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
