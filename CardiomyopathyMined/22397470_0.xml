<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> worldwide, with significant mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correct evaluation of the patient's myocardial function has important clinical significance in the diagnosis, therapeutic effect assessment and prognosis in non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the feasibility of three-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (3D-STE) for assessment of the left ventricular myocardial strain in patients with non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apical full-volume images were acquired from 65 patients with non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group) and 59 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC group), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were measured by 3D-STE: the peak systolic radial strain (RS), circumferential strain (CS), longitudinal strain (LS) of each segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the parameters were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The peak systolic strain in different planes had certain regularities in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> groups, radial strain (RS) was the largest in the mid region, the smallest in the apical region, while circumferential strain (CS) and longitudinal strain (LS) increased from the basal to the apical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the regularity could not be applied to the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RS, CS, LS were significantly decreased in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group as compared with NC group (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interobserver, intraobserver and test-retest reliability were acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 3D-STE is a reliable tool for evaluation of left ventricular myocardial strain in patients with non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, with huge advantage in clinical application </plain></SENT>
