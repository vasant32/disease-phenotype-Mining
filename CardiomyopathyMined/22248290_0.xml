<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we present an approach for modelling the interaction between the heart and the circulatory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was accomplished by creating animal-specific biventricular finite element (FE) models, which characterise the mechanical response of the heart, and by coupling them to a lumped-parameter model that represents the systemic and pulmonic circulatory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to minimise computation time, the coupling was enforced in a weak (one-way) manner, where the ventricular pressure-volume relationships were generated by the FE models and then passed into the circulatory system model to ensure volume conservation and physiological pressure changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The models were first validated by tuning the parameters, such that the output of the models matched experimentally measured pressures and volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then the models were used to examine cardiac function and the myofibre stress in a healthy canine heart and a canine heart with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed good agreement with experimental measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stress in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was found to increase significantly, while the pump function was decreased, compared to the healthy case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total runtime of the simulations is lesser than that of many fully coupled models presented in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This will allow for a much quicker evaluation of possible treatment strategies for combating the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, especially in optimisation schemes that require numerous FE simulations </plain></SENT>
