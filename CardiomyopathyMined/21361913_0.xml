<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a Chinese patient, born to non-consanguineous parents, who first presented at age 6 with clumsy walking and difficult climbing staircase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002091'>restrictive lung disease</z:hpo> previously diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, she progressed rapidly with proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003306'>rigid spine</z:hpo> and bilateral tightening of the Achilles tendons requiring surgical elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with restrictive <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> was shown by echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> was also noted in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history was unremarkable yet her father was incidentally found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis with genomic DNA of the proband showed heterozygous de novo known mutation c.626C&gt;T (p.Pro209Leu) and a germline variation c.772C&gt;T (p.Arg258Trp) in BAG3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her father was found to be a carrier of c.772C&gt;T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy findings were suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003715'>myofibrillar myopathy</z:hpo> on light microscopy and ultrastructural studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first Chinese case of Bag3opathy so far reported </plain></SENT>
