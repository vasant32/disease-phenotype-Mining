<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the pathogenesis of RCM from genotype to clinical phenotype is not fully understood, transgenic (Tg) mice were generated with cardiac specific expression of an RCM-linked missense mutation (R193H) in cTnI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>R193H Tg mouse hearts with 15% stoichiometric replacement had smaller hearts and significantly elevated end diastolic pressures (EDP) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a unique carbon microfiber-based assay, membrane intact R193H adult cardiac myocytes generated higher passive tensions across a range of physiologic sarcomere lengths resulting in significant Ca(2+) independent cellular diastolic tone that was manifest in vivo as elevated organ-level EDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sarcomere relaxation and Ca(2+) decay was uncoupled in isolated R193H Tg adult myocytes due to the increase in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension, decreased passive compliance of the sarcomere, and adaptive in vivo changes in which phospholamban (PLN) content was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further evidence of Ca(2+) and mechanical uncoupling in R193H Tg myocytes was demonstrated by the biphasic response of relaxation to increased pacing frequency versus the negative staircase seen with Ca(2+) decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, non-transgenic myocyte relaxation closely paralleled the accelerated Ca(2+) decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) transient amplitude was also significantly blunted in R193H Tg myocytes despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mechanical shortening resulting in myocyte hypercontractility when compared to non-transgenics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results identify for the first time that a single point mutation in cTnI, R193H, directly causes elevated EDP due to a myocyte intrinsic loss of compliance independent of Ca(2+) cycling or altered cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The compound influence of impaired relaxation and elevated EDP represents a clinically severe form of diastolic dysfunction similar to the hemodynamic state documented in RCM patients </plain></SENT>
