<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although numerous reports are available regarding monensin, little is known about lasalocid toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe accidental lasalocid poisoning on a farm in Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Eighty-one horses, of which 14 demonstrated clinical signs from day 0-21 after being fed a new concentrate batch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One horse died on day 20 and another on day 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The most severe cases (n = 7), admitted to the clinic on day 29-46, underwent cardiac examination and blood biochemical analysis, including determination of plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at admission and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 57-70, cardiac examination, cTnI determination or both were undertaken on 72 remaining horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Short-term effects of lasalocid intoxication included inappetance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscular weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 horses admitted to the clinic demonstrated signs of myocardial degeneration such as increased cTnI, dysrhythmia and reduced myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four horses developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> on day 40-50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five horses died or were euthanized on day 30-370, 2 horses recovered fully and returned to previous athletic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 72 remaining horses exhibited clinical signs between day 57-70, but 34 had dysrhythmia and 13 had increased cTnI concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After a period of rest, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> horses returned to their previous work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lasalocid was detected in hepatic tissue of 2 necropsied horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Lasalocid intoxication induced myocardial and neurological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although uncommon, this should be included as differential diagnosis for unexplained inappetance, signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in horses </plain></SENT>
