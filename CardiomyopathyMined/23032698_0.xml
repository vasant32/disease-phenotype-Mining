<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been well demonstrated that excessive blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level could be detrimental to the myocardial function through the variety of mechanisms, of which endoplasmic reticulum stress (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>) could play an unprecedented role through the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, reports are coming out with the evidences that UPR signaling proteins are regulated differentially depend on the experimental conditions and cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> has been proposed to be closely-associated with the regulation of lipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study we tried to find out expressions of myocardial UPR signaling proteins as well as proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic mellitus (DM) condition using Spontaneous Diabetic Torii (SDT) rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found the significant up-regulation of oxidative, nitrosative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> marker proteins in the myocardium of the SDT rats, in comparison to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Sprague-Dawley-SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the sub-arm of UPR signaling proteins, such as p-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>, p-eIF2α, ATF6, CHOP/GADD153, TRAF2, apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling proteins, such as BAD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C, cleaved caspase-7 and -12, were significantly up-regulated in the SDT rats, in comparison to the SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there were no significant changes in the phosphorylation of IRE-1α, and XBP-1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolisms, such as PPARα, PPARγ, CPT1, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1α except GLUT4, and the proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as p-Akt and p-PI3K were shown significant attenuation in its expressions in the SDT rats, when compared with the SD rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is suggested that the activation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> and ATF6 pathway are the major determinant rather than the IRE-1α-XBP1 pathway for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>-mediated metabolic dysfunction, which might eventually leads to diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
