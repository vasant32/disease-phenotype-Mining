<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A vast array of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> has been described in HCM, although their relationship to left ventricle (LV) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> appears elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to assess the relationship of ECG patterns with the HCM phenotype assessed according to the novel opportunities offered by cardiac magnetic imaging (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CMR and 12-lead ECG were performed in 257 HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> was defined by the sum of 9 criteria: abnormal cardiac rhythm, QRS duration≥100ms, Romhilt-Estes score≥5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fascicular block</z:e> (LAHB) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle-branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>), ST-T abnormalities, ST-T segment elevation≥0.2mV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo>, pathological Q waves, absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Q wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four ECG groups were identified: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0 criteria); mildly abnormal (1-3 criteria); moderately abnormal (4-6 criteria); markedly abnormal (7-9 criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a direct relationship between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> and HCM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LV mass index was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG and progressively increased with each class of ECG score, from 70.9±18.6g/m(2) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG to 107.1±55.1g/m(2) among those with markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> (p=&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the prevalence and extent of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) increased significantly with the ECG score, from 37% in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG to 93% in patients with markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> (overall p=0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG had a negative predictive accuracy of 96% for markedly increased LV mass (&gt;91g/m(2) for men and &gt;69g/m(2) for women), and of 100% for maximum LV thickness≥30mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large HCM cohort, the number and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> were directly related to phenotypic expression as revealed by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although false negative ECG findings remain a challenge in population screenings for HCM, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG proved effective in ruling out severe LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, suggesting potential implications for long-term follow-up of HCM patients and family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A simple score for quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in HCM patients is proposed </plain></SENT>
