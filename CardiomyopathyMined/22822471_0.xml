<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome microarray analysis has provided a new tool to understand the genetic basis of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>cardiovascular malformations</z:hpo> resulting from microdeletion or microduplication of genetic material, allowing the delineation of new syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improvements in sequencing technology have led to increasingly comprehensive testing for aortopathy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, single gene syndromic disorders, and Mendelian-inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding the genetic etiology for these disorders has improved their clinical recognition and management and led to new guidelines for treatment and family-based diagnosis and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These new discoveries have also expanded our understanding of the contribution of genetic variation, susceptibility alleles, and epigenetics to isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the current understanding of the genetic basis of syndromic and non-syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and highlights new diagnostic and management recommendations </plain></SENT>
