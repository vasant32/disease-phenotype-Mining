<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tetramethylpyrazine phosphate (TMPP) inhibits the activation of the calcium/calmodulin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Ca²⁺/CaM/CaMKII) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The α-myosin heavy chain cTnT(R141W) transgenic mouse was previously reported as a model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and it was used to test the effects of combinations of Rb1 and TMPP in reversing the progression of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and the potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival, echocardiography, histologic features assessed the effectiveness of Rb1 and TMPP treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were used to determine expression levels of certain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study clearly demonstrated that treatment with a combination of Rb1 and TMPP could inhibit the expression of HB-EGF, calmodulin1 (Calm1), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (Camk2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rb1 alone mainly reduced the expression of HB-EGF, and TMPP alone mainly reduced the expression of Calm1 and Camk2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Rb1 and TMPP had synergistic effects on the amelioration of chamber dilation, contractile dysfunction, interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and ultrastructural degeneration in cTnT(R141W) mice when compared with the results of treatment with Rb1 or TMPP alone, and those were probably due to the inhibition of both HB-EGF and the Ca²⁺/CaM/CaMKII pathway </plain></SENT>
