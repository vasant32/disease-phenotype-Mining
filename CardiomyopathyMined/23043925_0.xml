<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients pure ApHCM [age, (60.2±10.4) years, 31 men] were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LGE images were acquired using PSIR, and analyzed using a 17-segment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summing the LGE areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> short axis slices yielded the total volume of late enhancement, which was subsequently presented as a proportion of total LV myocardium (% LGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean maximal apical wall thickness was (17.9±2.3) mm, and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was (67.7±8.0)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LGE was detected in 130 segments of 30 patients (75.0%), occupying (4.9±5.5)% of LV myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LGE was mainly detected at the junction between left and right ventricles in 12 (30%) and at the apex in 28 (70%), although LGE-positive areas were widely distributed, and not limited to the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal LGE at the non-hypertrophic LV segments was found in some ApHCM patients, even without LGE of hypertrophied apical segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGE was frequently observed not only in the thickened apex of the heart but also in other LV segments, irrespective of the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simple presence of LGE on CMR was not representative of adverse prognosis in this population </plain></SENT>
