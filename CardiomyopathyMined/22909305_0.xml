<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the echocardiographic-Doppler, tissue-Doppler (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) findings of left ventricular function and survival in cirrhotics with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35095">DDF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six cirrhotics without endogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35095">DDF</z:chebi> was diagnosed by mitral inflow Doppler parameters and diastolic myocardial velocities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up for a median of 25 months (15-40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35095">DDF</z:chebi> was diagnosed in 51 (67%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with compared with those without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35095">DDF</z:chebi> had significantly older age and higher pulse rate as well as more frequently severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, greater aortic root diameter and interventricular septal thickness </plain></SENT>
