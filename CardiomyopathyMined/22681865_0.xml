<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mixed cohorts of patients with ischemic and nonischemic end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) with a QRS duration of ≥120 ms and requiring intravenous inotropes do not appear to benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CRT does provide greater benefit to patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and might, therefore, be able to reverse the HF syndrome in such patients who are inotrope dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, 226 patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who received a CRT-defibrillator and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤35% and QRS of ≥120 ms were followed up for the outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, transplantation, and ventricular assist device placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiograms were performed in patients with ≥6 months of transplant- and ventricular assist device-free survival after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) never took inotropes (n = 180), (2) weaned from inotropes before CRT (n = 30), and (3) dependent on inotropes at CRT implantation (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 47 ± 30 months of follow-up, the patients who had never taken inotropes had had the longest transplant- and ventricular assist device-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inotrope-dependent patients had the worst outcomes, and the patients weaned from inotropes experienced intermediate outcomes (p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reverse remodeling and left ventricular ejection fraction improvement followed a similar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients weaned from and dependent on inotropes, a central venous pressure &lt;10 mm Hg on right heart catheterization before CRT was predictive of greater left ventricular functional improvement, more profound reverse remodeling, and longer survival free of transplantation or ventricular assist device placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, inotrope therapy before CRT is an important marker of adverse outcomes after implantation in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with inotrope dependence denoting irreversible end-stage HF unresponsive to CRT </plain></SENT>
