<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction derived from two-dimensional echocardiography are two measures of adverse LV remodeling, which predict survival in patients with systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the geometric assumptions and image foreshortening that can occur with two-dimensional echocardiography reduces measurement accuracy and thus predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By its nature, three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography allows the entire LV shape to be studied, providing a methodology to examine LV remodeling through LV curvature on a global and regional scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to correlate changes in global and regional LV shape to LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Full-volume, 3D transthoracic echocardiographic studies of the left ventricle were performed in 106 consecutive patients with either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricles (n = 59) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> (n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Customized software (QLAB) was used to extract segmented 3D LV endocardial shells at end-systole and end-diastole and to analyze these shells to determine global and regional LV shape analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent t tests were used for intergroup comparisons, and linear regression was used to correlate regional shape changes with systolic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Derivation and analysis of the 3D LV shells was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> had significantly smaller curvature values, indicating rounder global LV shape throughout the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regional analysis identified a loss of septal and apical curvatures in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systolic apical mean curvature was well correlated with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that regional remodeling measured by regional 3D LV curvature correlates well with LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As well, this methodology is independent of the geometric assumptions that limit the predictive value of two-dimensional echocardiographic measures of LV remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, this is a novel tool that may have applications in the assessment and prediction of outcomes of different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
