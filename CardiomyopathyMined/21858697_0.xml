<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical applications are limited due to its cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> is responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> induced by ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that davallialactone (DAVA), extracted from mushroom Inonotus xeranticus, has potential antiplatelet aggregation activity and free radical scavenging properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether DAVA has protective effects against ADR-induced free radical accumulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cardiac muscle cells and compared the effects of DAVA with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of DAVA on ADR-induced cytotoxicity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi>) assay and crystal violet staining, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by flow cytometry, and the expression of stress-related proteins like Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, and the involvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed by nuclear condensation and the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as caspase-3 and polyadenosine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase (PARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardio-protective effects of DAVA were also evaluated in an in vivo study in an animal model of ADR-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that DAVA significantly increased the viability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-injured H9c2 cells and inhibited ADR-induced ROS production, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and the expression of Cu/Zn SOD and Mn-SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DAVA also inhibited the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which was activated by ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo animal model, treatment involving DAVA significantly reduced cardiomyocyte lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DAVA is a potentially <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agent</z:chebi> for ADR-induced cardiotoxicity in cardiomyocytes and can be a potential candidate to protect against cardiotoxicity in ADR-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
