<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cardioprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> [<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>] after experimental autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was elicited in Lewis rats by immunization with cardiac myosin, and twenty-eight days after immunization, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment effectively suppressed myocardial protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of inflammatory markers [CD68, iNOS, NF-kB, interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, monocyte chemotactic protein-1] in comparison to vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, myocardial protein levels of ACE-2 and ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>-treated group compared with vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and their marker molecules [OPN, CTGF, TGF-β1 and collagens I and III and atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and GATA-4, respectively] compared with those of vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly lowered the protein expressions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase subunits p47phox, p67phox, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production when compared with vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling molecules than with those of vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly improved LV systolic and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> treatment significantly improved LV function and ameliorated the progression of cardiac remodeling through the modulation of ACE-2/ANG 1-7/Mas receptor axis in rats with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
