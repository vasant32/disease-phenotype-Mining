<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous catheter ablation has evolved to be standard therapy to prevent recurrent implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks from VT in patients on antiarrhythmia medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Procedural outcomes in patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> are often limited by haemodynamically unstable VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although substrate- and pace-mapping techniques have become increasingly popular for VT ablation, these approaches can often times may not address inducible clinical and non-clinical VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation and entrainment mapping can help the operator target VT exit sites in a precise fashion minimizing the amount of radiofrequency ablation needed for a successful ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An evolving alternative strategy that allows induction and mapping of VT in the setting of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemodynamic instability</z:e> is through maintaining perfusion with a percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will discuss these pVAD technologies, distinguish technical applications of use, highlight the published clinical experience, provide a clinical approach for support device selection, and discuss use of these technologies with current mapping and navigational systems </plain></SENT>
