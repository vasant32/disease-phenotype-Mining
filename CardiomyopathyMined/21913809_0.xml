<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand increased platelet activity has been demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we aimed to investigate whether mean platelet volume (MPV) is increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002599'>increased MPV</z:mp> correlates with the degree of coronary microvascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MPV was measured in 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> also underwent echocardiographic examination including CFR measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> were divided into two groups based on median CFR value (lower CFR group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFR group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPV was significantly higher in the lower CFR group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFR group (9.00 ± 0.56 vs. 8.25 ± 0.76 ﬂ; respectively, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CFR correlated significantly and inversely to MPV (r = -0.475, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that MPV level was the independent predictor of lower CFR (β = -0.750, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MPV was an accurate predictor of low CFR (p = 0.001); Area under the curve was 82% (95% CI 0.67-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best cut-off value of MPV to predict low CFR was 8.3 fl with 95% sensitivity and 69% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study showed a negative correlation between MPV and CFR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
