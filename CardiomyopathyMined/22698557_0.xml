<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effects of ventricular restraint level on left ventricular reverse remodeling are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that restraint level affects the degree of reverse remodeling and that restraint applied in an adjustable manner is superior to standard, nonadjustable restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was performed in 2 parts using a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in the sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part I, restraint was applied at control (0 mm Hg, n = 3), low (1.5 mm Hg, n = 3), and high (3.0 mm Hg, n = 3) levels with an adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint (AMVR) device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restraint level was not altered throughout the 2-month treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial restraint level measurements and transthoracic echocardiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In part II, restraint was applied with the AMVR device set at 3.0 mm Hg (n = 6) and adjusted periodically to maintain that level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was compared with restraint applied in a standard, nonadjustable manner using a mesh wrap (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were followed up for 2 months with serial magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In part I, there was greater and earlier reverse remodeling in the high restraint group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the rate of reverse remodeling peaked and then declined as the measured restraint level decreased with progression of reverse remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In part II, adjustable restraint resulted in greater reverse remodeling than standard restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end diastolic volume decreased by 12.7% (P = .005) with adjustable restraint and by 5.7% (P = .032) with standard restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 18.9% (P = .014) and 14.4% (P &lt; .001) with adjustable and standard restraint, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restraint level affects the rate and degree of reverse remodeling and is an important determinant of therapy efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Adjustable restraint is more effective than nonadjustable restraint in promoting reverse remodeling </plain></SENT>
