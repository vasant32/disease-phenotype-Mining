<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> and function of Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been previously studied by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the value of electrocardiography (ECG) in relation to these two techniques remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifty genetically confirmed Fabry patients were investigated using a comprehensive clinical workup comprising 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, and CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECG parameters at rest [PR, P wave, QT, QTc, QT dispersion and time interval from the peak to the end of the T wave (T(peak) to T(end))] were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the entire cohort and did not distinguish between males and females or stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between left ventricular (LV) mass on CMR and both the QRS duration and the LV Sokolow index, with the highest values in male patients with an advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No prediction of late enhancement on CMR (a sign for replacement <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) was possible by a single ECG parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of ST or T alterations (in 37 of 38 patients) specifically excluded late enhancement on CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data in a large cohort of Fabry patients, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> stages, show, in contrast to former assumptions, that ECG parameters are not suitable to stage Fabry cardiomoypathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most ECG parameters were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the complete cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of ST or T alterations seems to almost exclude late enhancement on CMR in these patients </plain></SENT>
