<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases are inherited, with a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> in the close relatives of patients with NCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 156, mostly first-degree, family members of 44 adult patients with NCC who agreed to familial screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> was reported by 16 (36%) of the 44 patients, including premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in 8 families (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NCC (n = 32) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 9) was diagnosed in 41 relatives (26%) by echocardiography (n = 25), contrast echocardiography (n = 6), or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these family members, 13 already had known cardiac symptoms and signs, but most (28 of 41) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most subjects with NCC had mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction (n = 29, 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 55 months (interquartile range 43 to 93), most remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four family members were treated with prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and 23 of those with NCC were treated with drugs, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> (41%), Î² blockers (34%), and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is a high prevalence, mostly asymptomatic, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (26%) among first- and second-degree family members of patients with NCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This warrants screening and offers an opportunity for early intervention </plain></SENT>
