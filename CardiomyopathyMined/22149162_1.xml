<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT ADVANCES: Changes in the balance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> (H(2)S) play an important role in the pathogenesis of β-cell dysfunction that occurs in response to type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, changes in H(2)S homeostasis also play a role in the pathogenesis of endothelial injury, which develop on the basis of chronically or intermittently elevated circulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRITICAL ISSUES: In the first part of this review, experimental evidence is summarized implicating H(2)S overproduction as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of β-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second part of our review, experimental evidence is presented supporting the role of H(2)S deficiency (as a result of increased H(2)S consumption by hyperglycemic cells) in the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FUTURE DIRECTIONS: In the final section of the review, future research directions and potential experimental therapeutic approaches around the pharmacological modulation of H(2)S homeostasis in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
