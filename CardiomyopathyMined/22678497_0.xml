<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation requires Ca(2+) binding to troponin and/or binding of high affinity myosin complexes to actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations within components of the regulatory complex may lead to familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In several cases examined, either physiological or pathological changes in troponin alter the distribution among states of actin-tropomyosin-troponin that differ in their abilities to stimulate myosin ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations open possibilities for managing disorders of the troponin complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, analyses of mutant forms of troponin give insights into the regulation of striated muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
