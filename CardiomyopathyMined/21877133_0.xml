<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alström syndrome is caused by recessively inherited mutations in the ALMS1 gene, which codes for a putative ciliary protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alström syndrome is characterized by extensive allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effects have been observed in some populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 100 causative ALMS1 mutations have been identified, mostly frameshift and non-sense alterations resulting in termination signals in ALMS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a complex Turkish kindred in which sequence analysis uncovered an insertion of a novel 333 basepair Alu Ya5 SINE retrotransposon in the ALMS1 coding sequence, a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the mutations causing Alström syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is extraordinarily rare to encounter the insertion of an Alu retrotransposon in the coding sequence of a gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of the mutant ALMS1 allele in this isolated population suggests that this recent retrotransposition event spreads quickly, and may be used as a model to study the population dynamics of deleterious alleles in isolated communities </plain></SENT>
