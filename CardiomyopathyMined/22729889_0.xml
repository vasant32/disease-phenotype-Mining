<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was induced in rats by administration of DOX with or without co-treatment with fosinopril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fosinopril was utilized on day 1 or 14 of the treatment with DOX to compare efficacies of early versus late co-treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that fosinopril attenuated changes induced by DOX (e.g., less increased heart and left ventricular weights, diminished lung <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, attenuated LVEDP and LVSP, and less decreased +dP/dt and -dP/dt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, fosinopril diminished the levels of markers of cardiac toxicity (i.e., plasma levels and activities of cardiac enzymes and proteins AST, LDH, CPK, cTnI, and BNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fosinopril also prevented DOX-induced decreases in Ca(2+) uptake and restored activity of Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase in left ventricular sarcoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We next tested whether the improved Ca(2+) transport activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum was due to modulation of SERCA2 and phospholamban expressions by fosinopril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fosinopril attenuated the decrease in SERCA2 and phospholamban expressions caused by DOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cardioprotective effects of fosinopril in the DOX-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> appear to be due to its ability to prevent remodeling of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane </plain></SENT>
