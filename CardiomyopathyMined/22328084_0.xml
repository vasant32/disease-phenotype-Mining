<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that TBX20, a transcriptional regulator required for cardiac development, has key roles in the maintenance of functional and structural phenotypes in adult mouse heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditional ablation of Tbx20 in adult cardiomyocytes leads to a rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, with prominent conduction and contractility phenotypes that lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a more comprehensive molecular characterization of the functions of TBX20 in adult mouse heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coupling genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptome analyses (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq), we identified a subset of genes that change expression in Tbx20 adult cardiomyocyte-specific knockout hearts which are direct downstream targets of TBX20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed a dual role for TBX20 as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor, and that each of these functions regulates genes with very specialized and distinct molecular roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show how TBX20 binds to its targets genome-wide in a context-dependent manner, using various cohorts of co-factors to either promote or repress distinct genetic programs within adult heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our integrative approach has uncovered several novel aspects of TBX20 and T-box protein function within adult heart </plain></SENT>
