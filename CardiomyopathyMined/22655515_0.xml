<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently we reported a cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> overload to cause a severe osmotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that this dual overload of sodium ions and water precedes the dystrophic process and persists until fatty <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> is complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present paper addresses the questions as to whether these overloads are important for the pathogenesis of the disease, and if so, whether they can be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a first step, we investigated the effects of various <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> drugs on a cell model of DMD, i.e. rat diaphragm strips previously exposed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> were able to repolarise depolarised muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</z:chebi> are known to have acidifying effects and this might be detrimental to the ventilation of DMD patients, we mainly concentrated on the modern <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> derivative, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31547">eplerenone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This drug had a very high repolarizing power, the parameter considered by us as being most relevant for a beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a pilot study we administered this drug to a 22-yr-old female DMD patient who was bound to an electric wheelchair and has had no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31547">Eplerenone</z:chebi> decreased both cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water overload and increased muscle strength and mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31547">eplerenone</z:chebi> has beneficial effects on DMD muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our opinion the cytoplasmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> is cytotoxic and should be treated before fatty degeneration takes place </plain></SENT>
