<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, is a major target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in humans and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hallmarks of desmin-deficient (des(-/-)) mice pathology include pronounced myocardial degeneration, extended <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and osteopontin (OPN) overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify the molecular and cellular events regulating adverse cardiac remodelling in des(-/-) mice and their potential link to OPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In situ hybridization, histology, and immunostaining demonstrated that inflammatory cells and not cardiomyocytes were the source of OPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> profile comparison revealed that activation of inflammatory pathways, sustained by innate immunity mechanisms, predominated among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> changes occurring in degenerating des(-/-) myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of the most highly up-regulated genes (OPN: 226×, galectin-3: 26×, osteoactivin/Gpnmb/DC-HIL: 160× and metalloprotease-12: 98×) was associated with heart infiltrating macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of OPN, we generated des(-/-)OPN(-/-) mice and compared their cardiac function and remodelling indices with those of des(-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Osteopontin promoted cardiac dysfunction in this model since des(-/-)OPN(-/-) mice showed 53% improvement of left ventricular function, paralleled to an up to 44% reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diminished fibrotic response in the absence of OPN could be partly mediated by a dramatic reduction in myocardial galectin-3 levels, associated with an impaired galectin-3 secretion by OPN-deficient infiltrating macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiomyocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to desmin deficiency leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and subsequent overexpression of a series of remodelling modulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among them, OPN seems to be a major regulator of des(-/-) adverse myocardial remodelling and it functions at least by potentiating galectin-3 up-regulation and secretion </plain></SENT>
