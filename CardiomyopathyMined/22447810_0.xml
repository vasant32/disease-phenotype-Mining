<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four iDCM patients (mean age 63 ± 10.5 years) underwent mitral valve repair for severe FMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography confirmed the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients (77.7%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative ejection fraction (EF) was 30.4 ± 8.5%, left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) 67.5 ± 7.8 mm, left ventricle end-systolic diameter (LVESD) diameter 53.9 ± 8.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation (19 patients) and tricuspid repair (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 100% complete (mean 4.2 ± 2.5 years, median 4.2 years, range 3.3 months-11.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 6.5 years was 69 ± 8.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients submitted to successful AF ablation and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) had a significantly better survival (91 ± 7.9 vs 67 ± 9.5%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>≥3+/4+ was 89.1 ± 5.7% at 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiography showed a reduction in LVEDD (P &lt; 0.0001) and LVESD (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean EF increased to 38.7 ± 12.4% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified successful ablation of AF and/or CRT (P = 0.01) and higher preoperative EF (0.03) as predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation of AF and/or CRT (P = 0.02) and lower preoperative systolic pulmonary artery pressure (0.04) were identified as independent predictors of reverse LV remodelling at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 86.2% of the patients were in NYHA II or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mitral repair for FMR in well-selected iDCM patients is associated with low hospital mortality and significant clinical benefit at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Concomitant successful AF ablation and/or CRT provide a major symptomatic and prognostic advantage and should be associated to mitral surgery whenever indicated </plain></SENT>
