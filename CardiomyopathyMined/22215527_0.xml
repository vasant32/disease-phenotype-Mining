<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of over 25 zinc-dependent proteases that together have the capacity to degrade <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the protein components of the ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts are a major source of several MMPs in the heart, thereby representing a viable therapeutic target for regulating ECM turnover in cardiac pathologies characterized by adverse remodeling, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes current knowledge on the identity and regulation of MMPs expressed by CF and discusses future directions for reducing adverse myocardial remodeling by modulating the expression and/or activity of CF-derived MMPs </plain></SENT>
