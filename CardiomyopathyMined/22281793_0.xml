<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To understand whether patients with post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and myocardial viability (MV) could benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in terms of clinical, echocardiographic and neuro- hormonal parameters compared to patients without MV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and four consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using dobutamine stress echocardiography, 2 groups were identified: group A of 51 patients with MV and group B of 53 patients without MV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were implanted with biventricular pacing devices combined with an internal cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical, echocardiographic and neuro-hormonal parameters were evaluated at baseline and at six month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance for repeated measures on each variable suggestive of remodeling was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered responder every patient with: decrease of &gt; 15% in left ventricular volumes and/or improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction of &gt; 5% in addition to NYHA class improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the variables improved in both groups (time effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing the two groups (group effect), the following variables were significantly better in group A: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (p=0.02), NYHA class (p=0.003), reverse remodeling (RR) (p=0.007), dP/dt (p=0.005), left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.009), 3rd sound (p=0.01), and left ventricular end-systolic volume after the first week (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RR occurred at the first week after CRT only in Group A and was maintained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the time of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum difference of the decrease of left ventricular volumes between the two groups occurred after the first week (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with MV responded better than patients without MV with a significant improvement after the first week from CRT </plain></SENT>
