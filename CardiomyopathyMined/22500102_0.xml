<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we examined actin filament sliding-with or without human cardiac troponin (Tn) and α-tropomyosin (Tm)-propelled by rabbit skeletal heavy meromyosin, when temperature was varied continuously over a wide range (~20-63°C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the upper end of this temperature range, reversible dysregulation of thin filaments occurred at pCa 9 and 5; actomyosin function was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tn-Tm enhanced sliding speed at pCa 5 and increased a transition temperature (T(t)) between a high activation energy (E(a)) but low temperature regime and a low E(a) but high temperature regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was modulated by factors that alter cross-bridge number and kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (FHC) mutations, cTnI R145G, cTnI K206Q, and cTnT R278C, cause dysregulation at temperatures ~5-8°C lower; the latter two increased speed at pCa 5 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> temperatures </plain></SENT>
