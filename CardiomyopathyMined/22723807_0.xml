<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional survey involved out- and in-patient subjects receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient attentiveness, compliance, co-morbidities, complications, and international normalized ratio (INR) as well as adherence of medical staff to established <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment guidelines were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred-sixty patients were recruited (mean ± SD age = 54 ± 1.3 years; 46% males; 77% overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (28%), prosthetic heart valve (20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (12%). "<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> booklets" were made available to 25% of the patients, and ~80% of the recipients reported inadequate understanding of its content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INR was strictly monitored in 23% of the patients; ~70% never received Information Leaflets; ~88% were unaware of warning labels; and ~58% were unaware that over-thecounter medications may affect <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic INR (2.9 ± 0.2; 76 days) was achieved in 73%; 20% had high INR (3.7 ± 0.1; 18.6 days) and 7% had low INR (1.6 ± 0.1; 16.7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with high INR, 2.5% had major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with low INR, 5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor compliance and co-morbidities were associated with adverse events (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Attentiveness and adherence to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment and monitoring guidelines are suboptimal among patients and medical staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel strategies are necessary to alert patients, pharmacists and physicians on the seriousness of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment failure </plain></SENT>
