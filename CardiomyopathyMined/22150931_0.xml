<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> late ventricular extrastimulus delivered when His bundle was refractory failed to reset the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> while early ventricular extrastimulus caused paradoxical delay of the subsequent atrial response and terminated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> with a QRS not being followed by an atrial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a rare but specific sign for excluding atrial reentry as the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> when P wave or atrial activation is registered before QRS response </plain></SENT>
