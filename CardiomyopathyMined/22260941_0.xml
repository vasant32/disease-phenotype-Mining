<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk stratification of ARVC/D patients, however, remains an unresolved issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be helpful in identifying ARVC/D patients with increased risk of arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULts: We studied 30 consecutive patients (17 males; 45.4 ± 18 years) with ARVC/D, diagnosed according to guideline criteria; 15 patients (50%) had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) for primary SCD prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRV was assessed on 24-h ECG Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major arrhythmic events (SCD, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy for sustained VT or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period (19 ± 7 months), no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, but 5 patients (17%) experienced arrhythmic events (4 VTs and 1 VF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HRV parameters were significantly lower in patients with, compared with those without, arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-frequency amplitude was the most significant HRV variable associated with arrhythmic events in univariate Cox regression analysis (P=0.017), and was the only significant predictor of arrhythmic events in multivariable regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.88, P=0.047), together with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 16.1, P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that among ARVC/D patients HRV analysis might be helpful in identifying those with increased risk of major arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
