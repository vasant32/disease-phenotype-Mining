<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that patients with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> would be more psychologically vulnerable than those with MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiology admitting staff in the week following the September 2010 Christchurch earthquake prospectively identified patients with earthquake-precipitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Males were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consenting women met diagnostic criteria for one of the three conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a semistructured interview with a senior clinical psychologist who was blind to the cardiac diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Premorbid psychological factors, experience of the earthquake and psychological response were assessed using a range of validated tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen women were included in the study, six with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, five with MI and six with non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Earthquake experiences were notably similar across the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> scored high on the hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale, the health <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> questionnaire, the Eysenck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e> scale and the Impact of Event scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> scored as the most psychologically robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and extroversion scores were the same across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our hypothesis was incorrect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Women with non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> following an earthquake have higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e> scores than women with either MI or stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> following an earthquake is not specific to psychologically vulnerable women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The psychology of natural disaster-induced stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may differ from that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
