<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) who are clinically compensated may have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular (LV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this, altered intra-ventricular flow patterns have been recognized in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVs, flow in myopathic LVs would demonstrate a smaller proportion of inflow volume passing directly to ejection and diminished the end-diastolic preservation of the inflow kinetic energy (KE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) (49 ± 14 years, six females) and 10 healthy subjects (44 ± 17 years, four females), four-dimensional MRI velocity and morphological data were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A previously validated method was used to separate the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) into four flow components based on the blood's locations at the beginning and end of the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KE was calculated over the cardiac cycle for each component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EDV was larger (P = 0.021) and the ejection fraction smaller (P &lt; 0.001) in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> compared with healthy subjects; the SV was equivalent (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>: 77 ± 19, healthy: 79 ± 16 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the total LV inflow that passed directly to ejection was smaller in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (P = 0.000), but the end-diastolic KE/mL of the direct flow was not different in the two groups (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite equivalent LVSVs, HF patients with mild LV remodelling demonstrate altered diastolic flow routes through the LV and impaired preservation of inflow KE at pre-systole compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These unique flow-specific changes in the flow route and energetics are detectable despite clinical compensation, and may prove useful as subclinical markers of LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
