<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PG is the only junctional component found in both desmosomes and adherens junctions and thus plays a critical role in the regulation of cell-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar to β-catenin, PG is able to interact with components of the Wnt signaling pathway and directly affect gene expression by binding with LEF/TCF transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been proposed that PG functions primarily as a competitive inhibitor of β-catenin transcriptional activity by sequestering LEF/TCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to β-catenin, the contribution of PG as a transcriptional regulator in either physiological or pathological conditions is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is increasing clinical interest in PG as both a structural protein as well as a signaling molecule as mutations have been identified in the human PG gene that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) and cutaneous syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will discuss the connection between altered cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and gene expression and its contribution to disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
