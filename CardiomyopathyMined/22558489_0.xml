<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMRI sequences are now of a sufficiently robust quality to enable high spatial and temporal resolution image acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to CMRI becoming an effective non-invasive imaging gold standard for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this 2-part review, we outline the typical sequences used to image <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and present the imaging spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Part 1 focuses on the current classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, basic CMRI sequences used in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the imaging spectrum of common phenotypes </plain></SENT>
