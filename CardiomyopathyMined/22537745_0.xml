<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokines and chemokine receptors control the migration of leukocytes during the inflammatory process and are involved in the modulation of Th1 or Th2 responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine their influence, we investigated the possible role of CCL5/RANTES and CXCL8/IL8 chemokines, and CCR2 and CCR5 chemokines receptors cluster gene polymorphisms with the development of chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study included 260 Chagas seropositive individuals (asymptomatic, n=130; cardiomyopathic, n=130) from an endemic area of Colombia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and TaqMan SNP genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant differences in the distribution of the CCR5 human haplogroup (HH)-A (p=0.027; OR=3.78, 95% CI=1.04-13.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that the CCR5-2733 G and CCR5-2554 T alleles are associated, respectively, with a reduced risk of susceptibility and severity to develop chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other associations were found to be significant for the other polymorphisms analysed in the CCR5, CCR2, CCL5/RANTES and CXCL8/IL8 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the analysed chemokines and chemokine receptor genetic variants have a weak but important association with the development of chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the population under study </plain></SENT>
