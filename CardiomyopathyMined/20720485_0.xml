<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> have been shown to be beneficial beyond their cholesterol-lowering effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pleiotropic effects have been implicated in the protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and the reduction in appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were associated with a reduction in ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Medline and Cochrane databases were searched for studies in human subjects published in the English language between 1985 and February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies were included in our analysis if they provided data regarding the association between the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 166 identified articles, nine prospective studies with 150,953 patients enrolled met our inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a random effects model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy was associated with a 31% reduction in the risk of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> when compared with the group not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy (pooled relative risk = 0.69, 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.83; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> IÂ² = 57.3%) </plain></SENT>
