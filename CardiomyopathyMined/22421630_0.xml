<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in the identification of the causation of nonsyndromic genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: NGS sequencing of the entire genetic coding sequence (the exome) has successfully identified five novel genes and causative variants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> without previously known cause within the last 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continual rapidly decreasing costs of NGS will shortly allow cost-effective sequencing of the entire genomes of affected individuals and their relatives to include noncoding and regulatory variant discovery and epigenetic profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this rapid technological progress with sequencing, analysis of these large data sets remains challenging, particularly for assigning causality to novel rare variants identified in DNA samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: NGS technologies are rapidly moving to identify novel rare variants in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, but assigning pathogenicity to these novel variants remains challenging </plain></SENT>
