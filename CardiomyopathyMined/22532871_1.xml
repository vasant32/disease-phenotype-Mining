<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP, ANKRD1) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is extremely susceptible to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>; however, the mechanism(s) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced CARP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and its specific role in cardiomyocytes have not been completely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> treatment in cardiomyocytes resulted in inhibition of CARP transcription, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CARP protein levels, inhibition of myofilament gene transcription, and marked sarcomere disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of CARP with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) similarly inhibited myofilament gene transcription and disrupted cardiomyocyte sarcomere structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral overexpression of CARP, however, was unable to rescue the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced sarcomere disarray phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> also induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the cardiac transcription factor GATA4 in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CARP expression is regulated in part by GATA4, prompting us to examine the relationship between GATA4 and CARP in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show in co-transfection experiments that GATA4 operates upstream of CARP by activating the proximal CARP promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GATA4-siRNA knockdown in cardiomyocytes inhibited CARP expression and myofilament gene transcription, and induced extensive sarcomere disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral overexpression of GATA4 (AdV-GATA4) in cardiomyocytes prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> exposure maintained GATA4 levels, modestly restored CARP levels, and attenuated sarcomere disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, siRNA-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CARP completely abolished the Adv-GATA4 rescue of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced sarcomere phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate co-dependent roles for GATA4 and CARP in regulating sarcomere gene expression and maintaining sarcomeric organization in cardiomyocytes in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data further suggests that concurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of GATA4 and CARP in cardiomyocytes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> contributes in large part to myofibrillar disarray and the overall pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
