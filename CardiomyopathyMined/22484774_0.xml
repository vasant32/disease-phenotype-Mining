<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Data regarding sources of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the failing myocardium are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes actively participate in the oxidative damage observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) represents a source of toxic reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systolic HF who had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the LIP status in different populations of leukocytes in HF patients and we investigated its association with clinical and laboratory parameters, including conventional inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients were finally included in the analysis (mean age: 67 Â± 11 years, 54 men, 42 with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only LIP in granulocytes (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55-0.98; p=0.039) and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.99; p=0.027) were independently associated with severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation analysis revealed that LVEF was inversely associated with LIP in granulocytes (Spearman's rho: -0.39, p=0.002), LIP in monocytes (Spearman's rho: -0.35, p=0.007), and RVSP (Spearman's rho: -0.43, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between LVEF and inflammatory indexes was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LIP in granulocytes is independently associated with the severity of LV dysfunction in patients with systolic HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracellular redox active iron may represent a source of leukocyte reactive oxygen species in this setting </plain></SENT>
