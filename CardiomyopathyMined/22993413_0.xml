<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rationale: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in the heart by disease- and stress-inducing stimuli where they participate in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, remodeling, contractility, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) directly inactivates each of the MAPK terminal effectors, potentially being cardioprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: To determine the role of DUSP1 and DUSP4 in regulating p38 MAPK function in the heart and the effect on disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Here we generated mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking both Dusp1 and Dusp4 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While single nulls showed no molecular effects, combined disruption of Dusp1/4 promoted unrestrained p38 MAPK activity in both MEFs and the heart, with no change in the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), at baseline or with stress stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single disruption of either Dusp1 or Dusp4 did not result in cardiac pathology, although Dusp1/4 double null mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and increased mortality with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB731445 ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in Dusp1/4 double null mice indicating that DUSP1/4 function primarily through p38 MAPK in affecting disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, unrestrained p38 MAPK activity diminished cardiac contractility and Ca(2+) handling, which was acutely reversed with a p38 inhibitory compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor function in Dusp1/4 double null mice was also partially rescued by Pln (phospholamban) deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that Dusp1 and Dusp4 are cardioprotective genes that play a critical role in the heart by dampening p38 MAPK signaling that would otherwise reduce contractility and induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
