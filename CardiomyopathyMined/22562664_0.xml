<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The golden retriever <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (GRMD) dogs produce DMD pathology and mirror DMD patient's symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that bradykinin slows the development of pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the goals of this research were to characterize dystrophin-deficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to examine cardiac effects of bradykinin in GRMD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: At baseline, adult GRMD dogs had reduced fractional shortening (28 ± 2 vs. 38 ± 2% in control dogs, P &lt; 0.001) and left ventricular (LV) subendocardial dysfunction leading to impaired endo-epicardial gradient of radial systolic velocity (1.3 ± 0.1 vs. 3.8 ± 0.2 cm/s in control dogs, P &lt; 0.001) measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were normalized by bradykinin infusion (1 µg/min, 4 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In isolated permeabilized LV subendocardial cells of GRMD dogs, tension-calcium relationships were shifted downward and force-generating capacity and transmural gradient of myofilament length-dependent activation were impaired compared with control dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, phosphorylation of sarcomeric regulatory proteins and levels of endothelial and neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (e/nNOS) in LV myocardium were significantly altered in GRMD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these abnormalities were normalized in bradykinin-treated GRMD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in GRMD dogs is characterized by profound LV subendocardial dysfunction, abnormal sarcomeric protein phosphorylation, and impaired e/nNOS, which can be normalized by bradykinin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms accounting for DMD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and open new therapeutic perspectives </plain></SENT>
