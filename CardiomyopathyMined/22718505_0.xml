<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> suggests the existence of modifier genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2C could be important in this process given its role as transcriptional regulator of several cardiac genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any variant affecting MEF2C expression and/or function may impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this candidate gene approach, we screened 209 Caucasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients and 313 healthy controls for genetic variants in MEF2C gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses were performed with transient transfections of luciferase reporter constructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three new variants in non-coding exon 1 were found both in patients and controls with similar frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-way ANOVA analyses showed a greater left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (p = 0.011) in patients with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36930">10C</z:chebi>+10C genotype of the c.-450C(8_10) variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, one patient was heterozygous for two rare variants simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient presented thicker left ventricular wall than her relatives carrying the same sarcomeric mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro assays additionally showed a slightly increased transcriptional activity for both rare MEF2C alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that 15 bp-deletion and C-insertion in the 5'UTR region of MEF2C could affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, potentially by affecting expression of MEF2C and therefore, the expression of their target cardiac proteins that are implicated in the hypertrophic process </plain></SENT>
