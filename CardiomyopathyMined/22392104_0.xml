<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to classify ASH using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine whether the MRI classification of ASH is related to the presence of risk factors for HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients with ASH underwent cine and delayed-enhancement MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ASH was classified morphologically using cine MRI at end-diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between the MRI findings and the presence of risk factors in the ASH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ASH was classified into three subtypes by MRI: contiguous subtype showing various clinical and MRI features (57%), sigmoid subtype (29%) with fewer risk factors, and reverse-curve subtype (14%) in younger patients with the larger myocardial mass and delayed-enhancement, which were significantly related to the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI was used to classify ASH into three subtypes, which might be related to the presence of risk factors </plain></SENT>
