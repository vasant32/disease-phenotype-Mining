<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The implications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> (AP) in HF are less well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without AP in a cohort of patients with reduced ejection fractions and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (iCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent coronary angiography at Duke University Medical Center from January 2000 to September 2009 with ejection fractions &lt;40% and diagnoses of iCM with AP in the previous 6 weeks were compared to similar patients without AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to event was examined using Kaplan-Meier methods for 5 end points: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, or revascularization; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospitalization; and cardiovascular (CV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or CV hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 2,376 patients with iCM, 1,412 (59%) had AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had more co-morbidities and more previous revascularization than patients without AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, those with and without AP had similar risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.32), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or MI (p = 0.15), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospitalization (p = 0.37) (5-year event rates 41% vs 41%, 46% vs 47%, and 87% vs 85%, respectively), but those with AP had lower rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, or revascularization (p = 0.01) and higher rates of CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or CV hospitalization (p = 0.03) (5-year event rates 85% vs 87% and 77% vs 73%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AP is common in patients with iCM despite medical therapy and previous revascularization and is associated with increased CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or CV rehospitalization </plain></SENT>
