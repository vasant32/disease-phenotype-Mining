<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other Australian carybdeid jellyfish that may be associated with the syndrome include Carukia shinju, Carybdea xaymacana, <z:chebi fb="33" ids="15792">Malo</z:chebi> maxima, <z:chebi fb="33" ids="15792">Malo</z:chebi> kingi, Alatina mordens, Gerongia rifkinae, and Morbakka fenneri ("Morbakka") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These small jellyfish are difficult to capture and identify </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are located offshore of the coasts of Australian states including Queensland, The Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The syndromic illness, resulting from a characteristic relatively minor sting, develops after about 30 minutes and consists of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>muscle pains</z:hpo> especially of the lower back, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, vasoconstriction, prostration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in cases of severe envenomation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of actions of their toxins are obscure but they appear to include modulation of neuronal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels leading to massive release of endogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> (C. barnesi, A.Â mordens and M. maxima) and thereby to possible stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, pore formation may occur in myocardial cellular membranes (C. xaymacana) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In human cases of severe envenomation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> and myocardial dysfunction are associated with membrane leakage of troponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical management includes parenteral <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy, oxygen and mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No effective first-aid is known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large knowledge gaps exist in biology of the jellyfish, their distribution, their toxins and mode of actions and in treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1655386" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Irukandji syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
