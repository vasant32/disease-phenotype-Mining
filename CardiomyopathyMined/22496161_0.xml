<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has never been ascertained whether phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition exerts an antiremodeling effect in nonischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the cardioreparative properties of a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in a model of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-nine diabetic men (60.3 ± 7.4 years) with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging consistent with nonischemic, nonfailing diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (reduced circumferential strain [σ], -12.6 ± 3.1; increased left ventricular [LV] <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> [θ], 18.4 ± 4.6°; and increased ratio of LV mass to volume, 2.1 ± 0.5 g/mL) were randomized to receive sildenafil or placebo (100 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the metabolic indices were correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath>, strain, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, sildenafil produced a significant improvement compared with placebo in LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> (Δθ: sildenafil, -3.89 ± 3.11° versus placebo, 2.13 ± 2.35°; P&lt;0.001) and strain (Δσ: sildenafil, -3.30 ± 1.86 versus placebo, 1.22 ± 1.84; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil-induced improvement of LV contraction was accompanied by consistent changes in chamber geometry and performance, with a 6.5 ± 11 improvement in mass-to-volume ratio over placebo (P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β were the only markers affected by active treatment (Δmonocyte chemotactic protein-1: -75.30 ± 159.28 pg/mL, P=0.032; Δtransforming growth factor-β: 5.26 ± 9.67 ng/mL, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No changes were found in endothelial function, afterload, or metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early features of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> are LV concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> associated with altered myocardial contraction dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition, at this stage, has an antiremodeling effect, resulting in improved cardiac kinetics and circulating markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect is independent of any other vasodilatory or endothelial effects and is apparently exerted through a direct intramyocardial action </plain></SENT>
