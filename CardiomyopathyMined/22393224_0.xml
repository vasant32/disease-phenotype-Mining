<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients (24 men and 8 women; mean age, 51 y) with a diagnosis of idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> underwent GBPS and CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV and RV parameters including EDV, ESV, and EF from GBPS were calculated using fully automated gradient software and compared with those obtained by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biventricular volumes were underestimated by GBPS, compared with CMR (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found no statistical difference between these 2 methods in the assessment of LV EF (P = 0.23), whereas RV EF was overestimated by GBPS (P &lt; 0.001 vs. CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis yielded significant correlations between GBPS and CMR in the assessments of biventricular parameters (r = 0.83 for LV EDV, 0.88 for LV ESV, 0.89 for LV EF, 0.86 for RV EDV, 0.86 for RV ESV, and 0.62 for RV EF; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the deviations of RV indices between GBPS and CMR with the ratio of RV EDV to LV EDV showed that there was a statistically significant trend for RV volumes to be underestimated and for RV EF to be overestimated as the biventricular volumetric ratio decreased (r = 0.61 for RV EDV, 0.68 for RV ESV, and -0.55 for RV EF; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, GBPS correlated well with CMR for the assessment of biventricular parameters, but RV indices should be cautiously interpreted </plain></SENT>
