<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that echocardiographic deformation analysis would help to differentiate these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 15 patients with LVNC (9 males; 42 ± 9 years), 15 age- and gender-matched <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients, and 15 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic diagnosis of LVNC was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects standard echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) to study regional LV deformation were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was observed in standard echocardiographic parameters between LVNC and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, both patient groups showed significantly reduced annular displacements (septal: controls 14 ± 2 mm vs. <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> 6 ± 3 mm vs. LVNC 7 ± 3 mm) and reduced strain values of the LV segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A characteristic deformation pattern with significantly higher values in the LV base compared with the apex was observed in patients with LVNC by deformation measurements with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This gradient was found particularly in the lateral and inferior wall but spared the anteroseptal wall; non-compaction was not found in basal segments throughout the ventricle and also spared the anteroseptal midventricular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> the strain and strain rate values were homogeneously reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LV segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A special regional deformation pattern (preserved deformation in basal segments of LVNC) seems to be of major diagnostic help for the definite differential diagnosis of LVNC and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
