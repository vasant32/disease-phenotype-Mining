<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients (age, 64 ± 6 years) with functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ejection fraction, ≤ 35%) were examined before (baseline), soon (1.7 ± 1.5 months), and more than 1 year (16 ± 8 months) after restrictive mitral annuloplasty using multidetector computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, and end-systolic wall stress were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the period soon after restrictive mitral annuloplasty, significant reverse left ventricular remodeling was present, with decreases in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (149 ± 42 to 119 ± 41 mL/m(2), P = .04) and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (114 ± 44 to 78 ± 43 mL/m(2), P = .02), and an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (25% ± 10% to 37% ± 14%, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional changes in these parameters were seen in the later period (103 ± 29 mL/m(2), 61 ± 23 mL/m(2), and 42% ± 9%, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05 vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the early postrestrictive mitral annuloplasty period, the left ventricular mass index did not change significantly (104 ± 22 to 104 ± 18 g/m(2), P = NS), but significant regression occurred in the later period (90 ± 17 g/m(2), P &lt; .05 vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The end-systolic wall stress was significantly decreased in the early period (P &lt; .05) and was sustained in the late period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in left ventricular ejection fraction in the late period correlated significantly with the magnitude of the end-systolic wall stress reduction (r = -0.67, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that ventricular reverse remodeling occurs soon after restrictive mitral annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, myocardial reverse remodeling (ie, regression of <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp>) occurs over time between the early and late postoperative periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that the late improvement in left ventricular systolic performance might be attributable to a decrease in the left ventricular afterload </plain></SENT>
