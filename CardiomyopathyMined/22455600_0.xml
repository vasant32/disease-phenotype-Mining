<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> due to dystrophin mutations which abolish the expression of the M isoform (5'-XLDC), the skeletal muscle is spared through the up-regulation of the Brain (B) isoform, a compensatory mechanism that does not appear to occur in the heart of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We quantitatively studied the expression topography of both B and M isoforms in various human heart regions through in-situ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization, Reverse-Transcriptase and Real-Time PCR experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the methylation profile of the B promoter region in the heart and quantified the B isoform up regulation in the skeletal muscle of two 5'-XLDC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unlike the M isoform, consistently detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the heart regions, the B isoform was selectively expressed in atrial cardiomyocytes, but absent in ventricles and in conduction system structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the level of B isoform messenger in the skeletal muscle of 5'-XLDC patients was lower that of the M messenger present in control muscle, it seems sufficient to avoid an overt muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with the protein level in XLDC patients muscles we previously quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation studies revealed that the B promoter shows an overall low level of methylation at the CG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in both atria and ventricles, suggesting a methylation-independent regulation of the B promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> seen in 5'-XLDC patients appears to be functionally related to loss of the M isoform, the only isoform transcribed in human ventricles; in contrast, the B isoform is well expressed in heart but confined to the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the B isoform can functionally replace the M isoform in the skeletal muscle, its expression in the heart could potentially exert the same rescue function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Methylation status does not seem to play a role in the differential B promoter activity in atria and ventricles, which may be governed by other regulatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If these mechanisms could be deduced, de-silencing of the B isoform may represent a therapeutic strategy in 5'-XLDC patients </plain></SENT>
