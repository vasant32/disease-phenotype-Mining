<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by mutations in the TAZ gene coding for the tafazzin, a protein involved in the remodeling of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane results in respiratory chain dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No specific symptom has been identified in female carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report the first case of BTHS confirmed by TAZ gene analysis in a female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This girl experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at 1-month of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography diagnosed dilated-hypokinetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with noncompaction of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial metabolic screening was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for a cyclic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Respiratory chain analysis performed on skin fibroblasts revealed a decreased activity of complexes I, III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening on a bloodspot showed abnormal monolysocardiolipin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> ratio, later confirmed on cultured fibroblasts, indicative of BTHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic analyses finally confirmed the diagnosis of BTHS, by showing a large intragenic deletion of exons 1 through 5 in the TAZ gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis showed mosaicism for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> X and for a ring X chromosome with a large deletion of the long arm including the Xq28 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The girl presented recurrent episodes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003323'>progressive muscle weakness</z:hpo>, and had a fatal septic shock at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case highlights that the diagnosis of BTHS should also be suspected in female patients presenting a phenotype similar to affected boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In these cases, analysis of the monolysocardiolipin:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> ratio in bloodspots is a rapid and sensitive screening tool for BTHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However clinical expression in a carrier female requires hemizygosity for the mutated allele of the TAZ gene, which supposes a rearrangement of the TAZ gene region on the other X chromosome </plain></SENT>
