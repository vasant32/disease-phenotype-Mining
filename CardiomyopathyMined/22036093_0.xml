<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The question is whether special features exist such as T-wave inversions, localized right precordial QRS prolongation and r'/s ratio&lt;1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ARVC could be diagnosed according to ISFC/ESC criteria in 374 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRBBB was found in 22 cases (6%) and iCRBBB was present in 47 cases (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CRBBB T wave inversions ≥ V4 was found in 10 cases (n.s.) and r'/s ratio&lt;1 was present in 12 cases (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
