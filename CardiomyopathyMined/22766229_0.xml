<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of success of conservative management of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) and the predictors of failure of conservative therapy are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the efficacy of an algorithm for the management of symptoms and predictors of failed conservative therapy in 249 consecutive symptomatic patients with obstructive HC referred to a dedicated HC program for management in general or for septal reduction therapy (SRT) in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was considerable practice variation in the extent to which conservative therapy was optimized before referral for SRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 3.7 ± 2.9-year follow-up, symptoms resolved with addition of or increase in dosage of a β blocker, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">disopyramide</z:chebi> in 16%, 10%, and 10% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing with short atrioventricular delay controlled symptoms in 4 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 63% of patients, conservative measures failed to control symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of failure of conservative therapy were presence of New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.9, p = 0.001) and greater septal wall thickness (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.10, p = 0.003) at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At time of presentation, 93 patients (37%) were already on optimal therapy and were referred for SRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 156 patients who did not require immediate SRT, 93 (60%) were free from a recommendation for SRT at the end of the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in symptomatic patients with obstructive HC, conservative therapy is successful in &gt;1/3 of referred patients at 3.7-year follow-up, obviating SRT in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians in programs offering SRT should optimize conservative therapy before recommending SRT </plain></SENT>
