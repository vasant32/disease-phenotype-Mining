<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium channels are key transporters of iron under iron-overloaded conditions, and potentially represent a new therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">Calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> (CCB) use and serum ferritin among adults with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the nationally representative NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 1999-2002 for adults ≥40 years with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between CCBs and serum ferritin was assessed using a t-test and adjusted multiple regressions.The study population included 2143 individuals (representing 37.4 million individuals, 42.0 % males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12.6 % of the population reported taking CCBs in the last month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals taking CCBs had lower mean serum ferritin (129.3 ng/mL versus 154.5 ng/mL, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, menopause and hysterectomy status for women, race/ethnicity, and C-reactive protein, mean serum ferritin for individuals taking CCBs was 26.3 ng/mL lower than for those not taking CCBs (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an adjusted regression, individuals who took CCBs and had a daily <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> intake of ≥500 mg had a mean serum ferritin that was 60.1 ng/mL lower than people not taking CCBs and with daily <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> &lt; 500 mg (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study found an association between use of CCBs and lower serum ferritin levels in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess the possible use of CCBs as non-traditional chelating agents for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
