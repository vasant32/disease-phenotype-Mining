<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether exercise echocardiography predicts outcomes in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LV function and LVOT gradients were evaluated during exercise echocardiography in 239 patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients (25.1%) had LVOT obstruction at rest, and 43 (18%) developed exercise-induced LVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean resting LV ejection fraction was 69 ± 9%, and the mean resting wall motion score index was 1.00 ± 0.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall motion abnormalities during exercise were seen in 19 patients (7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 4.1 ± 2.6 years, 19 patients had hard events (cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cardiac transplantation, appropriate discharge of a defibrillator, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>), and 41 patients had composite end points of hard or soft events (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise wall motion abnormalities occurred in 31.5% of patients with hard events compared with 5.9% of patients without hard events (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, LV wall thickness (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.21; P = .002), resting wall motion score index (HR, 21.59; 95% CI, 2.38-196.1, P = .006), and metabolic equivalents (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88; P = .001) remained independent predictors of hard events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Change in wall motion score index was also independently associated with hard events (HR, 52.30; 95% CI, 3.81-718.5; P = .003) and with the composite end point (HR, 39.51; 95% CI, 3.79-412.4; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LVOT obstruction was not associated with either end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of exercise capacity and LV systolic function during exercise echocardiography may have a role in risk stratification of patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
