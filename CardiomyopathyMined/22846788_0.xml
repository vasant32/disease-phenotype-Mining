<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: We have included 115 consecutive SIC patients between January 2005 and January 2010 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic status and sympathetic nerve activity were evaluated and compared with those of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 64, and 14% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day and 3-year mortality was 6 and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, 3% developed thromboembolic complications, 6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and 14% developed cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The great majority of SIC patients (93%) were ethnic Swedes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three families, several close relatives developed SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent developed two or more episodes of SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic evaluation has shown subnormal systemic vascular resistance, 22% lower sympathetic activity and preserved cardiac output in SIC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: SIC affects both men and women of different ages and is associated with significant short- and long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is a strong signal for the presence of ethnic/genetic predisposition to develop SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic activity and systemic vascular resistance are lower in SIC patients, suggesting that SIC is a cardio-circulatory phenomenon </plain></SENT>
