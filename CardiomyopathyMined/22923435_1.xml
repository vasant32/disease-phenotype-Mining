<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene for a potential regulator of these motors, cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cMyBP-C's ability to modulate cardiac contractility is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using single-particle fluorescence imaging techniques, transgenic protein expression, proteomics, and modeling, we found that cMyBP-C slowed actomyosin motion generation in native cardiac thick filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mechanical effect was localized to where cMyBP-C resides within the thick filament (i.e., the C-zones) and was modulated by phosphorylation and site-specific proteolytic degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide molecular insight into why cMyBP-C should be considered a member of a tripartite complex with actin and myosin that allows fine tuning of cardiac muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
