<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Defined as clinically unexplained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the left ventricle, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) is traditionally understood as a disease of the cardiac sarcomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C (cTnC) are a relatively rare cause of HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed at age 5, the proband is family history-negative for HCM or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, suggesting a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TnC-extracted cardiac skinned fibers were reconstituted with the cTnC-A31S mutant, which increased Ca(2+) sensitivity with no effect on the maximal contractile force generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reconstituted actomyosin ATPase assays with 50% cTnC-A31S:50% cTnC-WT demonstrated Ca(2+) sensitivity that was intermediate between 100% cTnC-A31S and 100% cTnC-WT, whereas the mutant increased the activation of the actomyosin ATPase without affecting the inhibitory qualities of the ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary structure of the cTnC mutant was evaluated by circular dichroism, which did not indicate global changes in structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence studies demonstrated increased Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cTnC, the troponin complex, thin filament, and to a lesser degree, thin filament with myosin subfragment 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this mutation has a direct effect on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament, which may alter Ca(2+) handling and contribute to the arrhythmogenesis observed in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM </plain></SENT>
