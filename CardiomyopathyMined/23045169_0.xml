<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to further elucidate the natural history, clinical disease presentation, and course, and describe growth characteristics for males with BTHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of BTHS are referred to the BTHS Registry through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barth Syndrome</z:e> Foundation, self-referral, or physician referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is based on data obtained from 73 subjects alive at the time of enrollment that provided self-reported and/or medical record abstracted data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis of BTHS was 4.04 ± 5.45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the vast majority of subjects reported a history of cardiac dysfunction, nearly 6% denied any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most subjects had only mildly abnormal cardiac function by echocardiography reports, 70% were recognized as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the first year of life and 12% have required cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 73 enrolled subjects, there have been five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Growth curves were generated demonstrating a shift down for weight, length, and height versus the normative population with late catch up in height for a significant percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This data also confirms a significant number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, complications in the newborn period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> of motor milestones, and mild learning difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is apparent that the disease manifestations are variable, both over time for an individual patient and across the BTHS population. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
