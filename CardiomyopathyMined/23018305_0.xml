<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> has spread throughout Latin America because of the high rate of migration among these countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of Chagas' patients will develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 10% of these will develop severe cardiac damage leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta-blockade improves symptoms and survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients; however, its efficacy has not been well established in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> in cardiac remodeling and mortality in a Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Trypanosoma cruzi infection</z:e> in 55 Syrian hamsters that were divided into three groups: control (15), infected (20), and infected + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> (20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent echocardiography, electrocardiography, and morphometry for collagen evaluation in ventricles stained with picrosirius red </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The left ventricular diastolic diameter did not change between groups, although it was slightly larger in infected groups, as was left ventricular systolic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fractional shortening also did not change between groups, although it was slightly lower in infected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collagen accumulation in the interstitial myocardial space was significantly higher in infected groups and was not attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same response was observed in the perivascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival curve showed significantly better survival in the control group compared with the infected groups; but no benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> was observed during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (up to 100 days of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> did reduce mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">Carvedilol</z:chebi> did not attenuate cardiac remodeling or mortality in this model of Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The treatment did improve survival in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
