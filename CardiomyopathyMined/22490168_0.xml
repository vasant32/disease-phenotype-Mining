<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method for automated location of shape differences in diseased anatomical structures via high resolution biomedical atlases annotated with labels from formal ontologies is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, a high resolution magnetic resonance image of the myocardium of the human left ventricle was segmented and annotated with structural terms from an extracted subset of the Foundational Model of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Anatomy</z:mp> ontology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The atlas was registered to the end systole template of a previous study of left ventricular remodeling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> using a diffeomorphic registration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The previous study used thresholding and visual inspection to locate a region of statistical significance which distinguished patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from those with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using semantic technologies and the deformed annotated atlas, this location was more precisely found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this study used only a cardiac atlas, it provides a proof-of-concept that ontologically labeled biomedical atlases of any anatomical structure can be used to automate location-based inferences </plain></SENT>
