<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Partially retrospective, partially prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eleven Italian referral cardiac centers included in the Tako-tsubo Italian Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety consecutive individuals with TTC (92.1% female, mean age 66) were divided into three groups according to age (&lt;65, n = 78; 65-74, n = 61; ≥75, n = 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Clinical findings and in-hospital outcomes were evaluated in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants aged 65 and older had a greater prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = .001) and a lower glomerular filtration rate (P &lt; .001), and those aged 65 to 74 had a greater prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> (P = .01), ST-segment elevation on admission (P = .01) and a cerebrovascular disease (P = .003) than those younger than 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite similar left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on admission (P = .26), the oldest group had a lower LVEF at discharge (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inotropic agents were used more frequently in older adults (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-hospital composite adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and cardiogenic shock; P = .03) and overall complications (P = .004) were more common in participants aged 75 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall in-hospital mortality was low (2.8%) but was more prevalent in participants aged 75 and older (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age of 75 and older (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-5.82, P = .04) and LVEF on admission (HR = 0.874, 95% CI = 0.81-0.95, P &lt; .001) were the only independent predictors of in-hospital adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical profile of participants aged 75 and older with TTC was different from that of those younger than 75 with TTC, and they had a higher in-hospital complication rate </plain></SENT>
