<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior studies evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) among patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVD/C) have reported varied outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, studies have suggested that an epicardial ablation is necessary for improved outcomes after catheter ablation of VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) of VT in ARVD/C, with particular focus on newer ablation strategies, including epicardial catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 87 patients with ARVD/C who underwent a total of 175 RFA procedures between 1992 and 2011 at 80 different electrophysiology centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of VT following RFA and effect of RFA on the burden of VT were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the cohort was 38±13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 88.3±66 months, the overall freedom from VT of the 175 procedures was 47%, 21%, and 15%, at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative freedom from VT following epicardial RFA was 64% and 45% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, which was significantly longer than endocardial RFA (P=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival free of VT among procedures with 3D electroanatomic mapping was significantly longer compared to those without (P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Burden of VT was reduced irrespective of the ablation strategy (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although VT recurrences are common, RFA results in a significant reduction in the burden of VT in patients with ARVD/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, although the use of 3D electroanatomic mapping systems and epicardial ablation strategies are associated with longer survival free of VT, recurrence rates remain considerable </plain></SENT>
