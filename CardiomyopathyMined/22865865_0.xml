<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (CA) is challenging owing to vague symptomatology and non-specific echocardiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe regional patterns in longitudinal strain (LS) using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in CA and to test the hypothesis that regional differences would help differentiate CA from other causes of increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 55 consecutive patients with CA were compared with 30 control patients with LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (n=15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, n=15 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relative apical LS of 1.0, defined using the equation (average apical LS/(average basal LS + mid-LS)), was sensitive (93%) and specific (82%) in differentiating CA from controls (area under the curve 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression multivariate analysis, relative apical LS was the only parameter predictive of CA (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CA is characterised by regional variations in LS from base to apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A relative 'apical sparing' pattern of LS is an easily recognisable, accurate and reproducible method of differentiating CA from other causes of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
