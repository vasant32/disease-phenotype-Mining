<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two client-owned cats with a left ventricular internal dimension at end systole (LVIDs) &gt;14 mm, a fractional shortening (FS) &lt;28% and a lack of response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> therapy were included over a 9-year period (2001-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cats were divided into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32003">pimobendan</z:chebi> (n=16) and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32003">pimobendan</z:chebi> (n=16) treatment groups </plain></SENT>
