<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Decreased expression of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC) in the heart has been implicated as a consequence of mutations in cMyBPC that lead to abnormal contractile function at the myofilament level, thereby contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has not been established whether increasing the levels of cMyBPC in the intact heart can improve myofilament and in vivo contractile function and attenuate maladaptive remodeling processes because of reduced levels of cMyBPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We performed in vivo gene transfer of cMyBPC by direct injection into the myocardium of cMyBPC-deficient (cMyBPC(-/-)) mice, and mechanical experiments were conducted on skinned myocardium isolated from cMyBPC(-/-) hearts 21 days and 20 weeks after gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-bridge kinetics in skinned myocardium isolated from cMyBPC(-/-) hearts after cMyBPC gene transfer were significantly slower compared with untreated cMyBPC(-/-) myocardium and were comparable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> myocardium and cMyBPC(-/-) myocardium that was reconstituted with recombinant cMyBPC in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cMyBPC content in cMyBPC(-/-) skinned myocardium after in vivo cMyBPC gene transfer or in vitro cMyBPC reconstitution was similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo echocardiography studies of cMyBPC(-/-) hearts after cMyBPC gene transfer revealed improved systolic and diastolic contractile function and reductions in left ventricular wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that gene therapy designed to increase expression of cMyBPC in the cMyBPC-deficient myocardium can improve myofilament and in vivo contractile function, suggesting that cMyBPC gene therapy may be a viable approach for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> because of mutations in cMyBPC </plain></SENT>
