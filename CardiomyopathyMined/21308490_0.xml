<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four male rabbits were randomly divided into a control (8 rabbits) or one of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> groups (8 rabbits in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rabbits in the control group received saline, whereas rabbits in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> group received 2 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> weekly for 1-8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rabbits in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> groups received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 2 mg/kg for one (Group 1, 8 rabbits), two (Group 2, 8 rabbits), four (Group 3, 9 rabbits), or eight (Group 4, 11 rabbits) weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), shortening fraction (FS), and E/A ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiotoxicity scores were assessed by light microscopy using Billingham's method and also by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum H-FABP concentrations were quantified by a rabbit-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased LVEF, FS, and E/A ratio were detected in Group 4 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Billingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> scores of the rabbits in Group 3 were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those of rabbits in the control group or Groups 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Billingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> scores in Group 4 were the highest of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myocardial injury was demonstrable by electron microscopy in rabbits in Groups 2, 3, and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, serum H-FABP concentrations increased only in Group 4 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum H-FABP concentrations may not be a sensitive method for assessing early cardiotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
