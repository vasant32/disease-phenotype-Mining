<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, there is no medical treatment to prevent the mineralization of aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is generally thought that pathologic mineralization is linked to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of vascular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during mineralization as well as the survival signals for valvular interstitial cells (VICs), the main cellular component of aortic valves, remains to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, through several lines of evidence, we show that bioavailability of extracellular ATP is a signal which determines survival or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of VICs and, in doing so, plays a major role in the development of CAVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in CAVD and in VIC cultures undergoing mineralization, we found a high level of the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a genetic polymorphism in the intron 9 of the ENPP1 gene was associated with CAVD in a case-control cohort as well as with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of ENPP1 in aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high level of ENPP1 in CAVD promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-mediated mineralization of VICs by depleting the extracellular pool of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then documented that release of ATP by VICs promoted cell survival via the P2Y(2) receptor and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, our results show that level of ENPP1 modulates extracellular concentration of ATP, which is an important survival signal for VICs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may help to develop novel pharmacological treatment for CAVD </plain></SENT>
