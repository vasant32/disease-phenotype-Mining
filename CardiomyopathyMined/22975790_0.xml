<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) in children is challenging because of small patient size, frequent structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and the need for biventricular assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the role of echocardiography in the management of children supported by VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric patients who underwent VAD placement between May 2005 and May 2011 was performed to collect demographics, cardiac diagnoses, details of VADs, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic findings from the time of initial diagnosis until VAD explantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 32 patients (median age, 3 years; age range, 20 days to 16 years; median weight, 12.3 kg; weight range, 3.5-60 kg), 20 with left ventricular assist devices and 12 with biventricular assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (n = 27) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of support was 12 days (range, 1-141 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with decreased right ventricular function were 8 times more likely to undergo biventricular assist device placement compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> right ventricular function (P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-VAD intracardiac shunts were identified in 11 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac chamber dimensions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> were significantly reduced after VAD implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postimplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusions</z:hpo> were recognized in 16 patients and pericardial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography is invaluable in the management of pediatric patients receiving VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is helpful in pre-VAD assessment, guiding intraoperative device placement, recognizing VAD dysfunction, and identifying postimplantation complications </plain></SENT>
