<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both, rest and stress echocardiography were performed in 12 patients submitted to an undersized ring annuloplasty for FMR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean ring size was 27 +/- 1.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were in NYHA functional classes I-II, were in stable sinus rhythm, and without significant residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (grade &lt; or = 2/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At peak exercise (mean 81 +/- 12 W), the main cardiac performance indices were significantly improved, including systolic blood pressure (121 +/- 5.6 versus 169 +/- 14 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (63 +/- 15 versus 77 +/- 14 ml, p &lt; 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (43 +/- 9% versus 47 +/- 9%, p = 0.001), and systolic right ventricular function (pulsed tissue Doppler index peak systolic velocity: 8.6 +/- 1.7 versus 11.1 +/- 3.2 cm/s, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mild increase in planimetric mitral valve area was observed at peak exercise (2.12 +/- 0.4 versus 2.17 +/- 0.3 cm2, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the transmitral mean gradient was increased from 3.2 +/- 1.2 to 6.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg (p &lt; 0.0001), the systolic pulmonary artery pressure did not change significantly (27 +/- 2.8 versus 30.1 +/- 6.4 mmHg, p = 0.3), thus revealing a preserved cardiac adaptation to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these preliminary data, postoperative clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> was not observed in patients submitted to mitral repair for FMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stress echocardiography represents a valuable tool to assess an appropriate cardiac response to exercise and to detect a significant exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> after undersized annuloplasty ring surgery </plain></SENT>
