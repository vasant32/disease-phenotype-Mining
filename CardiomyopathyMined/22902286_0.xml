<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the poor prognosis, models are needed for the investigation of and development of new therapeutic approaches, as well as stem cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX), used as chemotherapeutic agent, is reported to be cumulative cardiotoxic causing <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of systolic dysfunction using echocardiography in rabbits receiving two different doses of DOX (1mg/kg twice a week and 2mg/kg once a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty rabbits were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in two different doses for 6weeks and compared with a control group treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> on the myocardium was investigated with histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy of left ventricle (LV), as well as in the interventricular septum (IVS) and right ventricle (RV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed a high mortality rate for rabbits receiving 2mg/kg once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in systolic function was present in animals treated with DOX after 6weeks, with decreased ejection fraction and shortening fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology and electron microscopy revealed vacuolization, intracytoplasmic granulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in LV, as well as in the IVS and RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> induced changes are present in the LV, RV and IVS, and the administration at the dose of 1mg/kg twice a week for only 6weeks is safe and sufficient to induce <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
