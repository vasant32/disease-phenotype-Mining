<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circadian rhythm disruption has been associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular pathologies</z:e> in both humans and animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking the core circadian clock gene, brain and muscle aryl <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like protein (Bmal1), are behaviorally arrhythmic, die prematurely, and display a wide range of organ pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, data are lacking on the role of Bmal1 on the structural and functional integrity of cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrate that Bmal1(-/-) mice develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with age, characterized by thinning of the myocardial walls, dilation of the left ventricle, and decreased cardiac performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shortly after birth the Bmal1(-/-) mice exhibit a transient increase in myocardial weight, followed by regression and later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dilation and failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo working heart preparations revealed systolic ventricular dysfunction at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dilation and failure, preceded by downregulation of both myosin heavy chain isoform <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed structural disorganization at the level of the sarcomere with a shift in titin isoform composition toward the stiffer N2B isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, passive tension generation in single cardiomyocytes was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings suggest that the loss of the circadian clock gene, Bmal1, gives rise to the development of an age-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which is associated with shifts in titin isoform composition, altered myosin heavy chain gene expression, and disruption of sarcomere structure </plain></SENT>
