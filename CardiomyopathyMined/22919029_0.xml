<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The outlook for patients with TM and other transfusion dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> has improved substantially with the availability of three iron chelating drugs and the use of T2* MRI to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac siderosis</z:e> before cardiac symptoms develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and DFP has proved particularly effective at treating a previously fatal iron induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the UK, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rather than iron induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is now the main cause of mortality in TM (23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that patient preference and compliance will result in the increased use of the oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> and corresponding reduced use of subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Randomised trials of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> may become more difficult to perform because of patient preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This will be particularly so if a third orally active iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> becomes clinically available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With each drug alone, however, a proportion of patients, perhaps 20%, will be inadequately chelated because of lack of efficacy or because the drug dosage has to be reduced or stopped because of side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Switching <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> and combination therapy of the oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> is likely to increase in use so a randomized trial of the two oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> DFP and DFX in combination against alternative chelation regimens is urgently needed </plain></SENT>
