<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cardiac strain calculated from tagged magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images provides clinicians information about abnormalities of heart-wall motion in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to develop an accurate method to determine the cardiac strain efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An adaptive windowed harmonic phase (AWHARP) method is proposed for cardiac strain calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: AWHARP is based on adaptive windowed Fourier transform (AWFT) and 2D Gabor wavelet transform (2D-GWT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AWFT provides a spatially varying representation of the signal spectra, which allows the harmonic phase (HARP) image to be extracted with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instantaneous spatial frequencies are calculated using 2D-GWT, and the widths of the adaptive windows are then determined according to the instantaneous spatial frequencies for multi-resolution analysis of phase extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed method was studied using simulated images and patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both single tagged images (SPAMM) and subtracted tagged images (CSPAMM) were generated using our simulation method, and their results calculated using AWHARP and HARP methods were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> and pathological tagged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were also processed to evaluate the performance of our method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our experimental results show that the accuracies of phase and strain images calculated using the AWHARP method are higher than that calculated using the HARP method especially for large tag line deformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement in accuracies can be up to 3.2 strain (E1) and 17.3 calculation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images reveals that the cardiac strain in the end-systolic state is significantly reduced for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) compared to that of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposed AWHARP is an accurate and efficient method for cardiac strain estimation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This new algorithm can help clinicians to detect left ventricle dysfunctions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial diseases</z:e> with accurate cardiac strain analysis </plain></SENT>
