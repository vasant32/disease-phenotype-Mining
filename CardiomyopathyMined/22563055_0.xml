<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CENP-F is a large multifunctional protein with demonstrated regulatory roles in cell proliferation, vesicular transport and cell shape through its association with the microtubule (MT) network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, analysis of CENP-F has been limited to in vitro analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using a Cre-loxP system, we report the in vivo disruption of CENP-F gene function in murine cardiomyocytes, a cell type displaying high levels of CENP-F expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of CENP-F function in developing myocytes leads to decreased cell division, blunting of trabeculation and an initially smaller, thin-walled heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Still, embryos are born at predicted mendelian ratios on an outbred background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After birth, hearts lacking CENP-F display disruption of their intercalated discs and loss of MT integrity particularly at the costamere; these two structures are essential for cell coupling/electrical conduction and force transduction in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of myocyte proliferation and cell coupling as well as loss of MT maintenance is consistent with previous reports of generalized CENP-F function in isolated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred percent of these animals develop progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, and there is a 20% mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, although it has long been postulated that the MT cytoskeleton plays a role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, this study is the first to reveal a direct genetic link between disruption of this network and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, this study has broad implications for development and disease because CENP-F loss of function affects a diverse array of cell-type-specific activities in other organs </plain></SENT>
