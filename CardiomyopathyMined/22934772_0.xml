<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have established that cocaine has the ability to cause irreversible structural damage to the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and others non cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous mechanisms have been postulated to explain how cocaine contributes to these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some effects are determined by the overstimulation of the adrenergic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the direct toxic effects are mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction produced during the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> or during the metabolism of norcocaina, as in cocaine-induced hepathotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, cocaine may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> by causing coronary artery vasoconstriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and by initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cocaine has also been shown to block K+ channels, increase L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel current, and inhibit <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> influx during depolarization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible causes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> if drug use is continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variety of respiratory problems temporally associated with crack inhalation have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cocaine may cause changes in the respiratory tract as a result of its pharmacologic effects exerted either locally or systemically, its method of administration (smoking, sniffing, injecting), or its alteration of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system neuroregulation of pulmonary function </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A lot of studies demonstrated a high incidence of congenital cardiovascular and brain malformations in offspring born to mothers with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009171" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cocaine abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
