<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been controversies regarding the conditions and mechanisms of MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify heart rate-dependent contractile properties related to MA, we performed incremental right atrial pacing in 17 idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) patients and in six control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal increase in left ventricular dP/dt during pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was assessed as the force gain in the force-frequency relationship (FG-FFR), and the maximal increase in left ventricular dP/dt of the first post-pacing beats was examined as the force gain in poststimulation potentiation (FG-PSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, MA was induced in 9 DCM patients (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> MA(+)) but not in the other 8 DCM patients (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> MA(-)), and not in any of the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> MA(+) had significantly lower FG-FFR (34.7 ± 40.9 vs 159.4 ± 103.9 mmHg/s, P = 0.0091) and higher FG-PSP (500.0 ± 96.8 vs 321.9 ± 94.9 mmHg/s, P = 0.0017), and accordingly a wider gap between FG-PSP and FG-FFR (465.3 ± 119.4 vs 162.5 ± 123.6 mmHg/s, P = 0.0001) than <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> MA(-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> MA(+) showed clear contrasts to those of the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MA is caused with an impaired force-frequency relationship despite significant poststimulation potentiation, suggesting that MA reflects ineffective utilization of the potentiated intrinsic force during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
