<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors to predict poorer outcome are not well established, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> And <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score to assess its value for predicting poor prognosis in patients with SIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven consecutive patients with SIC were followed prospectively during their hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors, including APACHE II score, coronary angiogram, echocardiography and cardiac enzymes at presentation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 37 patients, 27 patients (73%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 66.1 ± 15.6 yr, and the most common presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 42.5% ± 9.3%, and the wall motion score index (WMSI) was 1.9 ± 0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (16%) expired during the follow-up period of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the analysis of characteristics and clinical factors, the only predictable variable in prognosis was APACHE II score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with APACHE II score greater than 20 had tendency to expire than the others (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on present study, APACHE II score more than 20, rather than cardiac function, is associated with mortality in patients with SIC </plain></SENT>
