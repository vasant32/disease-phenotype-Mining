<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case report describes the role of genetic screening in a 39-year-old woman with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient wished to become pregnant and was seeking medical consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to electro- and echocardiograms, genomic DNA was isolated and direct sequencing was employed to screen the patient for some of the most common genes that cause HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pathogenic heterozygous mutation c.700 g &gt; a p.Arg186Gln in TNNI3 was identified, which was not found in 200 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation-specific genetic testing was also performed in four family members, and the same mutation was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic screening appears cost effective in familiar members with a known mutation, provides important information about the affected individual, and can facilitate the future management of family members and offspring </plain></SENT>
