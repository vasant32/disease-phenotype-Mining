<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Sinus rhythm (SR) electrocardiogram (ECG) features in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG characteristics that distinguish nonischemic VT substrate from prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) have yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify ECG differences between patients with basal-inferolateral scar due to NICM versus prior MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SR/atrial-paced ECGs from patients who underwent VT ablation with endocardial/epicardial basal-inferolateral nonischemic scar (n = 25) were compared to patients with inferior/inferolateral MI (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface QRS complexes in each lead were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> or ventricular pacing were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best diagnostic algorithm was determined by multivariate analysis then validated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NICM group had smaller R amplitude in leads I, II, and III (p ≤ 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), greater S amplitude in leads II, III, and V6 (p ≤ 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) and S/R ratio in lead V6 (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inferior Q waves were uncommon in NICM (24 % vs. 87 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lateral QRS fragmentation was uncommon (20 %) but only found in NICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A three-step algorithm was derived with 100 % sensitivity and 77 % specificity for NICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the validation cohort (n = 51), ICM was appropriately excluded in 93 % of the cases of NICM (91 % interobserver agreement) by the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lateral lead QRS fragmentation, absence of inferior Q waves, and lead V6 S/R ratio ≥0.25 on the SR ECG distinguishes patients with basal-lateral scar due to NICM from those with prior MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate the value of the surface ECG in identifying unique scar-based VT substrate </plain></SENT>
