<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall prognosis appears poor, with 42% of cats being euthanased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the clinical outcome of 19 cats with a presumptive diagnosis of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> [based on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings] was evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of neurological dysfunction at the time of presentation was similar to previously reported cases, ranging from ambulatory <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> to plegia with intact nociception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common lesion localisations (based on MRI) were to the C1-C5 (30%) and C6-T2 (30%) spinal cord segments with the T3-L3 and L4-S1 spinal cord segments accounting for 25% and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential inciting or predisposing causes for development of spinal infarction were identified in 12 cats, including physical exertion, trauma, general anaesthesia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to recovery of ambulation was 3.5 days (3-19 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cats (21%) were euthanased within 2 months of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 (79%) cats had a favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 10 years and 4 months with a median of 3 years and 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even when plegia was present at the time of presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving cats with long-term, owner-derived follow-up were reported to return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> quality of life, suggesting that the long-term prognosis for recovery from presumed ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> is favourable in the majority of cats </plain></SENT>
