<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the data generated by these techniques will require new and equally sophisticated analysis of large and complex datasets, using a systems biology approach with deeper phenotyping and advanced modelling techniques that have the flexibility for continuous update, refinement with discovery of new knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exciting new developments that may also transform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> research include those of infrastructure and organisation (multi-centre collaborations) and spin-offs from the field of regenerative medicine research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For clinical researchers that translate this information to the clinic the focus will however remain the same; namely improvement of quality and quantity of life </plain></SENT>
