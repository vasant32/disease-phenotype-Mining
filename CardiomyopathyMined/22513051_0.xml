<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among the animal models of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), the Golden Retriever <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> (GRMD) dog is considered the best model in terms of size and pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As in human patients presenting with DMD or Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> (BMD), the GRMD is related to a spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> mutation of dystrophin and is characterized by myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this respect, GRMD is a useful model to explore cardiac pathogenesis and for the development of therapeutic protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) isolated from healthy and GRMD dogs may differentiate into myocardial cell types, and to test the feasibility of cell therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> in a pre-clinical model of DMD, CPCs were isolated from cardiac biopsies of healthy and GRMD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene profile analysis revealed an active cardiac transcription network in both healthy and GRMD CPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, GRMD CPCs showed impaired self-renewal and cardiac differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Population doubling and telomerase analyses highlighted earlier senescence and proliferation impairment in progenitors isolated from GRMD cardiac biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that only wt CPCs showed efficient although not terminal cardiac differentiation, consistent with the upregulation of cardiac-specific proteins and microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the pathological condition adversely influences the cardiomyogenic differentiation potential of cardiac progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using PiggyBac transposon technology we marked CPCs for nuclear dsRed expression, providing a stable non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene marking method for in vivo tracing of CPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Xenotransplantation experiments in neonatal immunodeficient mice revealed a valuable contribution of CPCs to cardiomyogenesis with homing differences between wt and dystrophic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cardiac degeneration in dystrophinopathies may account for the progressive exhaustion of local cardiac progenitors and shed light on cardiac stemness in physiological and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide essential informations that canine CPCs may be used to alleviate cardiac involvement in large preclinical model of DMD </plain></SENT>
