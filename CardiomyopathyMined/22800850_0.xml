<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The importance of clinical presentation and pretransplantation course on outcome in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> listed for heart transplantation is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The impact of age, duration of illness, sex, race, ventricular geometry, and diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> on outcome in 261 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> enrolled in the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry and Pediatric Heart Transplant Study was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End points included <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> as United Network for Organ Sharing status 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while waiting, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age at the time of diagnosis was 3.4 years, and the mean time from diagnosis to <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> was 0.62Â±1.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while waiting were ventilator use and older age at <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> in patients not mechanically ventilated (P=0.0006 and P=0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shorter duration of illness (P=0.04) was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> as United Network for Organ Sharing status 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> after transplantation was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> at presentation (P=0.009), nonwhite race (P&lt;0.0001), and a lower left ventricular end-diastolic dimension z score at presentation (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> group, 17% (4 of 23) died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilator use and older age at <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while waiting, whereas nonwhite race, smaller left ventricular dimension, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although 97% of children with clinically or biopsy-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> at presentation survived to transplantation, they had significantly higher posttransplantation mortality compared with children without <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, raising the possibility that preexisting <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> adversely affects graft survival </plain></SENT>
