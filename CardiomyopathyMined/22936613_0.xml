<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We compared the efficacy and safety of alcohol septal ablation (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) for obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) in young, middle-aged, and elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intersociety guidelines suggest based on limited evidence that young patients with medically refractory symptoms of obstructive HCM should undergo surgical myectomy while elderly patients may be more appropriate for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 360 patients undergoing 389 ASAs were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Young (&lt;45 years), middle-aged (45-64 years), and elderly (ò65 years) patients comprised 28%, 40%, and 32% of the study population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Young patients had thicker left ventricular septal walls at baseline, and elderly patients had more comorbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resting, mean left ventricular outflow tract gradients (LVOTGs) were similar across the age groups at baseline (62, 66, and 68 mmHg, respectively; P=NS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVOTGs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> were significantly and similarly improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups immediately after <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and through 12 months of follow-up (P&lt;0.001 for before and after comparisons; P=NS for inter-group comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complication rates were similar for young and middle-aged patients but higher for elderly patients (9.1 and 6.3% vs. 20.8%, respectively; P≤0.016 for elderly vs. others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates for young and middle-aged patients were lower than for elderly patients, but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> had significant and similar improvements in LVOTGs and symptoms regardless of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications were increased in elderly patients, who had numerically but not statistically significantly higher mortality rates. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
