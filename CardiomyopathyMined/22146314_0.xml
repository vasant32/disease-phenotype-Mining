<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The occurrence and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is well known in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the feasibility of renal transplantation in the setting of cardiac dysfunction and the effect of renal transplantation on this progression remain poorly studied in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review of pediatric renal transplants between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and severe systolic dysfunction underwent renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were collected and compared for the pretransplant, peritransplant, and posttransplant periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nutritional support, dialysis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy led to improved cardiac function before transplantation (ejection fraction 28.8%±9.6% vs. 44.4%±11.5%; fractional shortening 12.7%±5.1% vs. 23.6%±6.2%); however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function was not achieved before transplantation in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, two patients had normalization of systolic function by hospital discharge, while the systolic function of the remaining four patients normalized during the first posttransplant year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean ejection fraction 1 year posttransplant was 22 units greater than before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced excellent allograft function in the peritransplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean estimated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance 1 year posttransplant was 93.2±33.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplantation can be performed safely in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and severe systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, systolic function continues to improve and may reach <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels during the first posttransplant year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of severe systolic dysfunction in pediatric dialysis patients should not deter referral for renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
