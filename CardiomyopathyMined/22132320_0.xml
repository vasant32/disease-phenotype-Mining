<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seeking a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e>, we studied cardiac histology, function, cardiomyocyte fatty acid uptake, and transporter gene expression in male C57BL/6J control mice and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> groups: similar mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and db/db and ob/ob mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At sacrifice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> groups had increased body and heart weights and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty livers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By echocardiography, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) of left ventricular diameter during systole were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The V(max) for saturable fatty acid uptake was increased and significantly correlated with cardiac <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>V(max) also correlated with expression of genes for the cardiac fatty acid transporters Cd36 and Slc27a1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes for de novo fatty acid synthesis (Fasn, Scd1) were also upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes were downregulated, suggesting that a decrease in cardiomyocyte ATP synthesis might explain the decreased contractile function in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> hearts </plain></SENT>
