<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic evaluation revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> by 2 mo and O-GlcNAcylation of several cardiac proteins and of nuclear transcription factor Sp1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 4 mo, systolic dysfunction was observed and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase expression decreased by 50% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids, which are elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> mice, can possibly be linked to excessive protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, as cultured cardiac myocytes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> showed increased O-GlcNAcylation and GFAT levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A link between excessive protein O-GlcNAcylation and cardiac dysfunction is further supported by results showing that reducing O-GlcNAcylation by O-GlcNAcase overexpression improved cardiac function in the diabetic mouse </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The nature and time course of changes observed in cardiac function suggest that protein O-GlcNAcylation plays a mechanistic role in the triggering of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
