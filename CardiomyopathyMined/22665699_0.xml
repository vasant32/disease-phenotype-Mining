<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the pathophysiology is clearly different between these disorders, we clarified the LP characteristics of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 15 BS and 12 ARVC patients and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BS patients had characteristic ECG changes and symptomatic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ARVC patients had findings that were consistent with recent criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three LP parameters (filtered QRS duration, root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex, and duration of low-amplitude signals [&lt;40 µV] in the terminal, filtered QRS complex) were continuously measured for 24 hours using a novel Holter-based signal-averaged ECG system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of LP determination in BS (80%) and ARVC (91%) patients were higher than in healthy controls (5%; P&lt;0.0001 in both) but did not differ between BS and ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In BS patients, the dynamic changes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LP parameters were observed, and they were pronounced at nighttime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, these findings were not observed in ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the SD values of the 3 LP parameters (filtered QRS duration, root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex, and duration of low-amplitude signals [&lt;40 µV] in the terminal, filtered QRS complex) over 24 hours were compared for the 2 patient groups, those values in BS patients were significantly greater than those in ARVC patients (P&lt;0.0001 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LP characteristics detected by the Holter-based signal-averaged ECG system over 24 hours differ between BS and ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dynamic daily variations of LPs were seen only in BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may imply that mechanisms of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in BS may be more correlated with autonomic abnormality than that of ARVC </plain></SENT>
