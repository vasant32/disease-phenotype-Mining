<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare trends in and causes of pregnancy-related mortality by race, ethnicity, and nativity from 1993 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each race, ethnicity, and nativity group, we calculated pregnancy-related mortality ratios and assessed causes of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the time between the end of pregnancy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Race, ethnicity, and nativity-related minority women contributed 40.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> U.S. live births but 61.8% of the 7,487 pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during 1993-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy-related mortality ratios were 9.1 and 7.5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100,000 live births among U.S.- and foreign-born white women, respectively, and slightly higher at 9.6 and 11.6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100,000 live births for U.S.- and foreign-born Hispanic women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to U.S.-born white women, age-standardized pregnancy-related mortality ratios were 5.2 and 3.6 times higher among U.S.- and foreign-born black women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, causes and timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 42 days postpartum were similar for U.S.-born white and black women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and other pre-existing medical conditions emerging as chief contributors to mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">Hypertensive disorders</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and embolism were the most important causes of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Except for foreign-born white women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other race, ethnicity, and nativity groups were at higher risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes than U.S.-born white women after adjusting for age differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Integration of quality-of-care aspects into hospital- and state-based maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> reviews may help identify race, ethnicity, and nativity-specific factors for pregnancy-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III </plain></SENT>
