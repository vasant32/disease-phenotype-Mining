<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of an active, otherwise healthy 57-year-old <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivor who, 17 years after chemotherapy, presented with symptoms of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had no cardiac risk factors, and neither laboratory nor imaging findings suggested <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings and differential diagnosis led us to attribute her condition to late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By virtue of tapered medical therapy, her left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 0.20 to 0.55 in 8 months, and she was asymptomatic after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction in our patient and the very late appearance of cardiotoxicity secondary to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> therapy raise questions about the pathogenesis and prevalence of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and how to improve outcomes in patients who present with related symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
