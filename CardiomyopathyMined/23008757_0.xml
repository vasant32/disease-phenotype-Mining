<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC) is typically triggered by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> emotional or physical stress events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of emotional stressors on clinical features, laboratory parameters, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings in patients with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 103 patients enrolled from the TTC registry database, fifteen patients had emotional triggers (E group), and 88 patients had physical triggers or no triggers (other group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most clinical presentations and in-hospital courses were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, E group had higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (87 versus 42 %, P = 0.001), palpitation (27 versus 6%, P = 0.008), whereas other group had higher prevalence of cardiogenic shock (35 versus 7%, P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E group had significantly higher corrected QT intervals (median, 477.5 versus 438 ms, P = 0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (mean, 45.7 versus 39.6%, P = 0.001), but lower hs-CRP (median, 0.1 versus 3.3 mg/L, P = 0.001), CK-MB (median, 5.5 versus 11.9 ng/mL, P = 0.047), troponin-I (median, 1.0 versus 3.2 ng/mL, P = 0.011), and NT-proBNP levels (median, 2145 versus 4939 pg/mL, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other group required more frequent hemodynamic support and had significantly longer intensive care unit (median, 3 versus 1 days, P = 0.005) and in-hospital (median, 17 versus 3 days, P = 0.001) durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of TTC are different between groups with and without preceding emotional stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The TTC group with preceding emotional stressors was more likely to have preserved cardiovascular reserve and lesser likely to require hemodynamic support than other group although the entire prognosis of TTC is excellent regardless of triggering stressors </plain></SENT>
