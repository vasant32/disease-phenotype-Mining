<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mutated form it can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cMyBP-C appears to have separate regions for different functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three phosphorylation sites near the N terminus modulate contractility by their effect on both the kinetics of contraction and the binding site of the N-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C terminal region binds to myosin rods and stabilizes thick filament structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study reported here was to test whether cMyBPC is important in producing the structural and functional changes that result from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study the sequential changes in cMyBP-C, contractility, and thick filament structure following dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion have been studied in biopsied specimens from chronically instrumented dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One and two dimensional electrophoresis, electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry with multiple antibodies generated against different domains in cMyBP-C have been used to follow structural changes in cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> produced dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent reperfusion released the dephosphorylated cMyBP-C from myofibrils and activated proteolysis of the cytoplasmic cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This in turn leads to increased vulnerability of cMyBP-C to proteolysis and increased degradation of thick filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The state of cMyBP-C appears to be closely related to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine 282 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the absence of the stabilizing action of cMyBP-C either as a consequence of genetic mutation or dephosphorylation, premature degradation of thick filaments occurs and is accompanied by persistent contractile dysfunction </plain></SENT>
