<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The signal transduction pathways mediating the progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> have been intensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered signaling of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which play important roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, has been observed in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pilot study to test whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STATs were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of two SNPs of STATs (rs6503691 C/T in exon 1 of STAT5B and rs4796793 C/G in the 5' region of STAT3) in 251 DCM patients and 484 control subjects were determined with the use of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and TaqMan assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> risk was found to be associated with T allele of rs6503691 (P = 0.012, OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.07-1.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that increased <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> risk statistically significantly associated with rs6503691 in a dominant model (P = 0.009, OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.11-2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> risk and rs4796793 was observed (P = 0.706, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.83-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present pilot study provides evidence that both rs6503691 T allele and CT/TT genotypes, but not rs4796793 C/G in the 5' region of STAT3, are associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, indicating that common genetic polymorphism in STATs is associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
