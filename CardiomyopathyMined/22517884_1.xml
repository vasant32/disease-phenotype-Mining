<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> is the most common diagnosis leading to heart transplantation and places a significant burden on healthcare worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers an exceptional opportunity for creating disease-specific cellular models, investigating underlying mechanisms, and optimizing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we generated cardiomyocytes from iPSCs derived from patients in a <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> family carrying a point mutation (R173W) in the gene encoding sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to control healthy individuals in the same family cohort, cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients exhibited altered regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> (Ca(2+)), decreased contractility, and abnormal distribution of sarcomeric α-actinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When stimulated with a β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed characteristics of cellular stress such as reduced beating rates, compromised contraction, and a greater number of cells with abnormal sarcomeric α-actinin distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenergic blockers</z:chebi> or overexpression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase (Serca2a) improved the function of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients recapitulate to some extent the morphological and functional phenotypes of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and may serve as a useful platform for exploring disease mechanisms and for drug screening </plain></SENT>
