<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of TTC is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some authors hypothesized a possible connection between TTC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disease, but no previous study analyzed the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait and TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study sought to assess the potential role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait in the development and clinical course of TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included in the present prospective case-control study 50 consecutive patients admitted to our Hospital with a diagnosis of TTC according to the Mayo Clinic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty control patients with anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> matched for clinical characteristics such as age, gender, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the hospitalization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were asked to complete the Spielberger Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI) scale for measuring self-reported trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (Trait-A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures at follow-up were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, TTC recurrence, and rehospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean value of STAI scale was 46 ± 12 in TTC patients and 45 ± 14 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients (p = 0.815) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait (STAI scale value ≥ 40) was documented in 30 (60%) TTC patients and in 26 (52%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients (p = 0.387) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, predictors of TTC were lower peak <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase value (HR 0.999; 95% CI 0.998-0.999; p = 0.018) and an antecedent stressful trigger event (HR 45.487; 95% CI 6.471-319.759; p = 0.001), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in outcome measures between TTC patients with or without high-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In TTC patients, high-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait is a common finding but it is not significantly more frequent than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a high-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait seems to be neither associated with a worse clinical outcome nor a predictor of TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our study do not support the routine evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> trait in patients with TTC </plain></SENT>
