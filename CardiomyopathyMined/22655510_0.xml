<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD) is a disease linked to the X-chromosome which affects 1 in 3,600-6,000 newborn males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is manifested by the absence of the dystrophin protein in muscle fibres, which causes progressive damage leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the third decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only medication so far shown to be effective in delaying the progression of this illness are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, which have been shown to increase muscle strength in randomised controlled studies; long-term studies have demonstrated that they prolong walking time and retard the progression of respiratory dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several potential drugs are now being investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic therapy, involving the insertion of a dystrophin gene through a vector, has proven effective in animals but not humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently under clinical study is Ataluren, a molecule that binds with ribosomes and may allow the insertion of an <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> in the premature termination codon, and exon-skipping, which binds with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and excludes specific sites of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing, producing a dystrophin that is smaller but functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are also studies attempting to modulate other muscular proteins, such as myostatin and utrophin, to reduce symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paper does not address <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> treatment in DMD patients </plain></SENT>
