<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical adequacy of the application, performance, and diagnostic and therapeutic decisions of ECC indicated by the GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, multicentre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four health centres (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 684 patients over 18 years who had an ECC performed in 2006-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASUREMENTS: A review of medical records and the ECC report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The socio-demographic variables, clinical and diagnostic performance were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients (62.3%) were â‰¥ 65 years, of which 61.8% were female The most frequent reasons for performing ECC were (but not limited to): <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>: 30%, suspected valvular disease: 26%; suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>: 24.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequacy of the ECC: 84% (95% CI: 81.09-86.7%) with differences by age (p=.02), HC teaching (p&lt;.001), comorbidity (p&lt;.001) and abnormal ECC (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A disease was found in 80% of ECC, with differences according to age (p&lt;.001), comorbidity (p=0.02), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (p&lt;.001) and degree of appropriateness of ECC (p=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common findings (but not limited to) included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (61.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (43%) diastolic dysfunction (28.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of the ECC helped make decisions in 35.2%, with 17.1% referred to cardiology, 10.5% treatment change and 9.6% other tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that the application of ECC was highly appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of ECC drive clinical decisions in a high percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The ECC should be accessible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GP </plain></SENT>
