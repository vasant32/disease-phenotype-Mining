<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, MicroRNAs (miR) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-kinase (AMPK) have emerged as prominent players in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that components of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) pathway are targeted by miRs and alter AMPK signaling during pathological cardiac stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), we demonstrated early elevation of miR-195 and miR-451 in HCM hearts, which targets MO25, a central component of the MO25/STRAD/LKB1 complex that acts as an upstream kinase for AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show functional targeting of MO25 by miR-195 and -451 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further in vitro interrogation of MO25 as a functional target validated this hypothesis where over-expression of miR-195 in C2C12 cells knocked down MO25 expression levels and downstream AMPK signaling (phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">Acetyl CoA</z:chebi> carboxylase [ACC] and AMPK activity assay), similar to MO25 knockdown in C2C12 cells by siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parallel changes were measured in 60 day R403Q HCM male hearts that were rescued by short-term administration of AICAR, an AMPK <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Elevated miR-195 targets the LKB1/AMPK signaling axis in HCM progression and implicates a functional role in HCM disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiR-195 may serve as potential therapeutics or therapeutic targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
