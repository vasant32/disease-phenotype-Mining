<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> (IMIDs) may result in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has not previously been assessed whether <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with and without an IMID have different prevalences and quantities of cardiotrophic viruses in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared the profiles of cardiotrophic viruses in heart tissue of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with and without an IMID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum and myocardial tissue samples were obtained from 159 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided into three groups, the first two based on the presence (n = 34) or absence (n = 125) of an IMID and the third being a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parvovirus B19 virus genome was detected in equal quantities in the non-IMID <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients (100/125) and the control group (15/20) but in lower quantities in the IMID patients (21/34, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the non-IMID and IMID <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients demonstrated increased myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> compared to controls: 12.5 ± 1.8 and 14.0 ± 3.2 CD45-positive inflammatory cells, respectively, versus 5.1 ± 0.7 for the controls (P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, significantly higher parvovirus B19 copy numbers could be amplified in non-IMID than in IMID patients (561 ± 97 versus 191 ± 92 copies/μg DNA, P &lt; 0.001) and control subjects (103 ± 47 copies/μg DNA, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study shows decreased parvovirus B19 prevalence and copy numbers in hearts of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with an IMID compared to those without an IMID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest that <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with an IMID have a different pathophysiologic mechanism from that which is present in the virus-induced form of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
