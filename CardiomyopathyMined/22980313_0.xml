<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry database to compare the survival experience of children with NS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) with children with idiopathic or familial HCM and to identify clinical and echocardiographic predictors of clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Longitudinal data in 74 children with NS and HCM and 792 children with idiopathic or familial isolated HCM were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children with NS were diagnosed with HCM before 6 months old more often (51%) than children with HCM (28%) and were more likely to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) (24% vs 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NS cohort had lower crude survival than the group with other HCM (P = .03), but survival did not differ after adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the NS cohort (1-year survival 78%), a diagnosis of HCM before age 6 months with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> resulted in 31% 1-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower height-for-age z score (hazard ratio 0.26, P = .005) in place of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and lower left ventricular fractional shortening z score (hazard ratio 0.79, P = .04) also independently predicted mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NS with HCM have a worse risk profile at presentation compared with other children with HCM, resulting in significant early mortality (22% at 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001255'>Decreased height</z:mp>-for-age and lower, although still supranormal, left ventricular fractional shortening z score are independent predictors of mortality in patients with NS with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such patients should have an aggressive therapeutic approach including potential <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> for cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
