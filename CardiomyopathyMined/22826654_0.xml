<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present case involves an adult with a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, initially exhibiting mild systolic dysfunction and slightly prominent left ventricular trabeculations progressing over 13 years to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and overt noncompaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present case strongly suggests a correlation between the extent of noncompaction and the degree of systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial presence of a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> and mild trabeculations highlights the genetic determinants of non-compaction and the importance of closely following patients with mild noncompaction due to the possibility of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More sensitive diagnostic criteria are needed to avoid overlooking mild cases, which may show prominent trabeculations without reaching a requisite ratio of compacted to noncompacted tissue </plain></SENT>
