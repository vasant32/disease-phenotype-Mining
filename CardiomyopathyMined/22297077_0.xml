<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, reliable morphometric reference data for anatomical or histological changes are unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify diagnostically relevant morphometric criteria that clearly distinguish feline HCM from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearts from 15 cats with HCM had <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weights</z:mp> (g per distance between the first and eighth vertebral bodies) when compared with hearts from 15 matched control cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several anatomically defined and digitally scanned areas of standardized cross sections were significantly increased in HCM when compared with controls, including the area across the entire heart half-way between the coronary sulcus and apex, the right and left ventricular walls and the ventricular septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were similar when the papillary muscles were included in the measurements of the right and left ventricular walls and the ventricular septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological morphometric analyses failed to identify any significant differences, including the diameter and cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes and the length, width or areas of cross-sectioned nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, morphometric analyses failed to identify any differences in the amount of cardiomyocyte fibre branching or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, only the relative weight and macroscopical analyses proved useful in distinguishing feline hearts with HCM from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results do not uphold the hypothesis that increased cardiomyocyte diameter is a principal change in feline HCM </plain></SENT>
