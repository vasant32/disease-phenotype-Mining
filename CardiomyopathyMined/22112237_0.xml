<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with ADR have experienced side effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and "chemobrain", which have been correlated to changes in protein expression in the heart and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand cellular responses that are disrupted following ADR treatment in immune tissues, this work focuses on spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000692'>reduced spleen sizes</z:mp> were found in ADR-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global isotopic labeling of tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to determine differences in the relative abundances of proteins from ADR-treated mice relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine proteins of the 388 unique proteins identified showed statistically significant differences in expression levels following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ADR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed proteins are involved in processes such as cytoskeletal structural integrity, cellular signaling and transport, transcription and translation, immune response, and Ca(2+) binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These are the first studies to provide insight to the downstream effects of ADR treatment in a peripheral immune organ such as spleen using proteomics </plain></SENT>
