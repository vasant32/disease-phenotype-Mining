<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with ECPR for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in pediatric cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> from 2002 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was survival to discharge, and the secondary endpoint was long-term functional neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 160 total uses of cardiac ECMO in 159 patients, 90 (56%) were ECPR (mean age 2.05 years; range, 0 days to 16.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients (71%) were postoperative, of which 36 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> and 28 were biventricular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (10%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, and 17 patients (19%) were nonpostoperative (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo>; 12 biventricular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients (66%) had open chest cannulation, and 31 (34%) had peripheral cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (56%) survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration of ECMO was 4.3 ± 4.0 days (median 3) for survivors and 6.3 ± 5.4 days (median 5) for nonsurvivors (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, almost half of survivors without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an appropriate application of ECMO in pediatric cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We report overall survival of 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients have favorable outcomes (89% survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Biventricular patients have better outcomes then <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation also seems to be a good strategy for nonpostoperative patients (71% survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of postoperative patients (46%) resuscitated with ECPR survived to hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
