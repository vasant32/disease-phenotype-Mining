<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study focuses on the A13T mutation in the human ventricular myosin RLC (regulatory light chain) that is associated with a rare FHC variant defined by mid-ventricular obstruction and septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We generated heart-specific Tg (transgenic) mice with ~10% of human A13T-RLC mutant replacing the endogenous mouse cardiac RLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examinations of longitudinal heart sections from Tg-A13T mice showed enlarged interventricular septa and profound fibrotic lesions compared with Tg-WT (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>), expressing the human ventricular RLC, or non-Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional studies revealed an abnormal A13T mutation-induced increase in isometric force production, no change in the force-pCa relationship and a decreased Vmax of the acto-myosin ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a fluorescence-based assay showed a 3-fold lower binding affinity of the recombinant A13T mutant for the RLC-depleted porcine myosin compared with WT-RLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the A13T mutation triggers a hypertrophic response through changes in cardiac sarcomere organization and myosin cross-bridge function leading to abnormal remodelling of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant functional changes observed, despite a low level of A13T mutant incorporation into myofilaments, suggest a 'poison-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>' mechanism of disease </plain></SENT>
