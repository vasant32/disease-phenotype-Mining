<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the extent and pattern of myocardial amyloid infiltration in explanted or autopsied hearts of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> related to acquired monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) or hereditary transthyretin (TTR) related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (ATTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed nine explanted/autopsied hearts from patients with AL (n = 4) and ATTR (n = 5) cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each heart, a biventricular histological macrosection was obtained at mid-ventricular level and analyzed with both inspective and computer-assisted histologic and histomorphometric analysis aimed in particular at quantifying muscle cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and amyloid infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extent of amyloid infiltration of the left ventricle (LV) ranged from 45 to 76% (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 57% [51-64]) of the overall surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although LV trabecular and subendocardial were the most infiltrated layers (45-94%, median [IQR] = 73% [67-84] and from 44 to 71%, median [IQR] = 57% [49-59], respectively), intra- and inter-patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three main patterns of amyloid infiltration of the LV were identified: diffuse (five cases), mainly subendocardial (two cases), and mainly segmental (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of amyloid infiltration of the right ventricle ranged from 48 to 93% (median [IQR] = 61% [59-83]); contributions of parietal and trabecular layers ranged from 32 to 99% (median [IQR] = 63% [47-88]) and from 49 to 93% (median [IQR] = 74% [64-79]), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In amyloidotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> is highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different patterns of infiltration are identifiable, including diffuse, mainly segmental and mainly subendocardial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Awareness of this variability can help the interpretation of ECGs, echocardiograms and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
