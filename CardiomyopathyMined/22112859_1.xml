<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there are several reports on the systematic screening of mutations in the disease-causing genes in European and American populations, only limited information is available for Asian populations, including Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic screening of disease-associated mutations in 8 genes for sarcomeric proteins, MYH7, MYBPC3, MYL2, MYL3, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, and ACTC, was performed by direct sequencing in 112 unrelated Japanese proband patients with familial HCM; 37 different mutations, including 13 novel ones in 5 genes, MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, and TPM1, were identified in 49 (43.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3 carried compound heterozygous mutations in MYBPC3 or TNNT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of patients carrying the MYBPC3, MYH7, and TNNT2 mutations were 19.6%, 10.7%, and 8.9%, respectively, and the most frequently affected genes in the northeastern and southwestern parts of Japan were MYBPC3 and MYH7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several mutations were found in multiple unrelated proband patients, for which the geographic distribution suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effects of the mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the frequency and distribution of mutations in a large cohort of familial HCM in Japan </plain></SENT>
