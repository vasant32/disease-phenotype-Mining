<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is increasing evidence that inorganic mercury (iHg) and organic mercury (including <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> mercury) have a range of immunotoxic effects, including immune suppression and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of iHg on a model of autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in mice induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of timing of iHg exposure on disease; in some experiments, mice were pretreated with iHg (200 μg/kg, every other day for 15 days) before disease induction with virus inoculation, and in others, they were treated with iHg after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>) phase of disease but before the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>iHg alone had no effect on heart pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with iHg before CVB3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> significantly increased the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> compared with control animals receiving vehicle alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment with iHg after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> did not affect the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> induced by iHg pretreatment were not due to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication in the heart, which was unaltered by iHg treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>iHg pretreatment induced a macrophage infiltrate and mixed cytokine response in the heart during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, including significantly increased interleukin (IL)-12, IL-17, interferon-γ, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL-17 levels were also significantly increased in the spleen during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we show for the first time that low-dose Hg exposure increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in a murine model </plain></SENT>
