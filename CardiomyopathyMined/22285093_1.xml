<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 65 subjects; 20 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with ejection fractions ≤35% and wide QRS complexes (≥120 ms), 20 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with ejection fractions ≤35% and narrow QRS complexes (&lt;120 ms), and 25 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV dyssynchrony index was determined as the SD of time to peak 3D speckle-tracking radial strain and regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of LV rotation (rotational dispersion index) as the SD of 3D speckle-tracking time to peak rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rotational indexes were significantly impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>, while LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with wide QRS complexes was significantly smaller than that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with narrow QRS complexes and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, LV dyssynchrony index (127.3 ± 24.0 ms [p &lt;0.01 vs controls and vs patients with narrow QRS complexes] vs 88.8 ± 22.5 ms [p &lt;0.01 versus controls] vs 30.9 ± 10.0 ms) and rotational dispersion index (115.1 ± 27.5 ms [p &lt;0.01 vs controls and vs patients with narrow QRS complexes] vs 96.0 ± 23.4 ms [p &lt;0.01 versus controls] vs 45.0 ± 13.7 ms) were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with wide QRS complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the LV ejection fraction (β = 0.688, p &lt;0.001) and rotational dispersion index (β = -0.249, p &lt;0.01) were independent determinants of LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> with wide QRS complexes improved after cardiac resynchronization therapy (p &lt;0.05), along with reductions in LV dyssynchrony and rotational dispersion indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings obtained with a novel 3D speckle-tracking system feature a novel aspect of LV torsional mechanics and demonstrate its association with LV dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
