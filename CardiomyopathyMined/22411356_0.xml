<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced signaling by Gα(s) and Gα(q) leads to cardiac injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, while Gα(i2) signaling in cardiac myocytes can protect against ischemic injury and β-adrenergic-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We asked whether enhanced Gα(i2) signaling in mice could protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> using a point mutation in Gα(i2) (G184S), which prevents negative regulation by regulators of G protein signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our expectation, it worsened effects of a genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gα (i2) (G184S/+) /<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> double heterozygote mice (TG9(+)Gα (i2) (G184S/+)) had substantially decreased survival compared to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, heart weight/body weight ratios (HW/BW) were significantly greater in TG9(+)Gα (i2) (G184S/+) mice as was expression of natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamine</z:chebi> injury in Gα (i2) (G184S/G184S) mutant mice produced markedly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and collagen III gene expression vs WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac fibroblasts from Gα (i2) (G184S/G184S) mice also showed a serum-dependent increase in proliferation and ERK phosphorylation, which were blocked by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gα(i2) signaling in cardiac myocytes protects against ischemic injury but enhancing Gα(i2) signaling overall may have detrimental effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, perhaps through actions on cardiac fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
