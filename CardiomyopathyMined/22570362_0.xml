<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> who require hospital admission are at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation during their first hospitalization and in the first year that follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the value of routine data collected during that time to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the need for transplantation prior to discharge and within 1 year of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective review of 83 pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> whose initial hospitalization fell between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at hospitalization was 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients demonstrated moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction on initial echocardiogram (80%) and/or the need for intravenous inotropes within 7 days of hospital admission (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (6%) died, and 15 (18%) were transplanted in the initial hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, 11/71 (15%) had died, and 27/71 (38%) were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, transplantation, or rehospitalization at 1 year following admission was 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fractional shortening, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, mixed venous saturation, and atrial filling pressures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation during the initial hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction was predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> marks a period of high risk for clinical decline, end stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and the need for cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic function and hemodynamic and serum measurements may aid in predicting outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite medical management, most patients will be rehospitalized and/or require cardiac transplantation within 1 year of admission </plain></SENT>
