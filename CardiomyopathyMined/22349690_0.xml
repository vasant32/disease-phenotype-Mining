<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several coronary angiographic studies have reported that enlarged and tortuous epicardial coronary arteries are characteristic of patients with left ventricular concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (LVCH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that small volumes opacified by contrast medium can be accurately measured by 64-multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and that there is a direct relationship between the coronary artery volume and left ventricular (LV) mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of coronary artery volume with LV mass in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and 18 patients with LVCH who underwent MSCT angiography were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coronary arteries were segmented on a workstation, and the appropriate window settings obtained from the results of the phantom experiments were applied to the volume-rendered images to calculate the total coronary artery volume (right and left coronary arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absolute coronary lengths and volumes in patients with LVCH and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were greater than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coronary artery volumes adjusted for LV mass in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were found to be smaller than those in patients with LVCH or in controls, and these values did not differ between patients with LVCH and controls (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> 4.1 ± 0.9, LVCH 5.4 ± 1.4, controls 5.5 ± 2.3 ml/100 g of LV mass, P &lt; 0.005; <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> vs LVCH, P &lt; 0.01; and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> vs control, P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study showed that the increase in the coronary artery volume in patients with LVCH matched the increase in LV mass, but a decreased coronary volume with regard to LV mass was characteristic of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
