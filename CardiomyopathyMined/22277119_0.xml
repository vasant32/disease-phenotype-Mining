<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it is currently unknown if carriers display a specific crypt <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, we compared crypts in carriers with other cardiac pathologies (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides, we aimed to determine the optimal imaging plane for the detection of crypts by comparing modified two-chamber views with standard long-axis views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of crypts to identify carriers in HCM family screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard CMR long-axis views with additional modified two-chamber views were prospectively performed in carriers (n= 43), consecutive CMR control patients (n= 252), and mutation-negative family members (n= 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crypts were found in 70% (30/43) of carriers and in 12% (31/252) of controls (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crypts in carriers showed deeper penetrance into the myocardium compared with controls (74 ± 21% vs. 59 ± 22%, P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection of two or more crypts had a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 94% for carriership </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modified two-chamber views doubled the sensitivity to detect crypts compared with standard long-axis views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In family screening, ≥2 crypts had a 100% positive predictive value to identify carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple crypts in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> are highly specific for HCM mutation carriership and warrant clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A modified two-chamber view has a superior sensitivity compared with standard long-axis views for crypt detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CMR may be of additional value to identify carriers in family screening </plain></SENT>
