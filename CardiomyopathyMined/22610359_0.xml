<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> itself is an independent risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is thought to be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> leads to increased central and total blood volumes along with decreased systemic arterial resistance resulting in high cardiac output state related adaptations in the cardiac structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistence of these hemodynamic changes ultimately results in diastolic dysfunction, however, whether these changes progress to significant systolic dysfunction or not is doubtful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some MUGA (Multi Gated Acquisition) scan-based studies had shown mild degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, however, these findings could not be confirmed with recent echocardiogram-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using extensive literature review, we found no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> leading to significant systolic dysfunction fulfilling criterion for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVEF &lt;35Â %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, any <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patient presenting with severe LV dysfunction should prompt further investigations to evaluate for the underlying etiology </plain></SENT>
