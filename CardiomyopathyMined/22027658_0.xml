<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HCM is also the most-common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in individuals younger than 35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Much progress has been made in the elucidation of the genetic basis of HCM, resulting in the identification of more than 900 individual mutations in over 20 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most of these genes encode sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin-7 (also known as cardiac muscle Î²-myosin heavy chain; MYH7), cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac muscle troponin T (TNNT2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular events that ultimately lead to the clinical phenotype of HCM are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss several potential pathways, which include altered calcium cycling and sarcomeric calcium sensitivity, increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, disturbed biomechanical stress sensing, and impaired cardiac energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An improved understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved will result in greater specificity and success of therapies for patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
