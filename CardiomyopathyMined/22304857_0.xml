<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animals, sugar intake accelerates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> development by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) can fuel ROS production by providing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16474">reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, G6PD also facilitates ROS scavenging using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a high-sugar intake would increase flux through G6PD to increase myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> and ROS and accelerate cardiac dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six-week-old TO-2 hamsters, a non-hypertensive model of genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by a δ-sarcoglycan mutation, were fed a long-term diet of high <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> or high sugar (57% of energy from <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 24 wk, the δ-sarcoglycan-deficient animals displayed expected decreases in survival and cardiac function associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ejection fraction: control 68.7 ± 4.5%, TO-2 starch 46.1 ± 3.7%, P &lt; 0.05 for TO-2 starch versus control; TO-2 sugar 58.0 ± 4.2%, NS, versus TO-2 starch or control; median survival: TO-2 starch 278 d, TO-2 sugar 318 d, P = 0.133) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the high-sugar intake was expected to exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, surprisingly, there was no further decrease in ejection fraction or survival with high sugar compared with <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> in cardiomyopathic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyopathic animals had systemic and cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> (increased serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and decreased myocardial oxidative enzymes) that were unaffected by diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high-sugar intake increased myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A sugar-enriched diet did not exacerbate ventricular function, <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, or survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> despite an increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
