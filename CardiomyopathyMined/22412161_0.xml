<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these breeds, distinct causative genetic mutations have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two breeds appear to have slightly different clinical presentations, including age of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observation that these two breeds may have different clinical presentations, as well as different genetic mutations, suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a diverse disease in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is poorly described in the Sphynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to phenotypically characterize Sphynx <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to evaluate for a familial etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Records of 18 affected cats (11 female, seven male) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age of affected cats ranged from 0.5 to 7 years (median, 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four affected cats were from a single family and included an affected cat in each of four generations (three females, one male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to evaluate for a causative mutation and better classify the phenotypic expression </plain></SENT>
