<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this exploratory analysis we assessed the impact of age, different <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy on progenitor cell concentration and function in patients recruited to our clinical trials of BMSC therapy for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of CD34+ cells and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were measured in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of 201 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cell mobilisation following G-CSF and the functional capability of CD34+ cells (using a colony forming unit assay) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that older age was associated with lower PB CD34+ cell concentration in the whole study group as well as blunting the effect of G-CSF on BMSC mobilisation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) was associated with significantly higher baseline PB CD34+ and EPC concentration compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following G-CSF treatment, CD34+ cell concentration was greater in the BM compared to PB, however the PB CD34+ cells appeared to have a greater and improved (compared to baseline) functional potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest treatment with G-CSF improves the functional potential of mobilised circulating progenitor cells compared to those in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to determine which source of cells is best for the purposes of cardiac repair following G-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
