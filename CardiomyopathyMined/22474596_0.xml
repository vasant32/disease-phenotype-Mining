<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the reduction of cardiac GATA4 expression reported in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> alters the expression of downstream genes, namely, atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP), B-type natriuretic, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP), and α- and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC). db/db mice, a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with lean littermates serving as controls, were studied. db/db mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and reduced protein expression of cardiac GLUT4 and IRAP (insulin-regulated aminopeptidase), the structural protein cosecreted with GLUT4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hearts from db/db mice had reduced protein expression of GATA4 (~35%) with accompanying reductions in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of ANP (~40%), BNP (~85%), and α-MHC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (~50%) whereas expression of β-MHC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased by ~60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low GATA4 was not explained by an increased ligase or atrogin1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHIP protein content was modestly downregulated (27%) in db/db mice whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of the CHIP cochaperone HSP70 was significantly decreased in db/db hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that low GATA4 in db/db mouse heart is accompanied by reduced expression of GATA4-regulated cardioprotective and structural genes, which may explain the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
