<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 268,000 Fidelis leads were implanted worldwide until distribution was suspended because of a high rate of early failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Careful analyses of predictors of increased lead failure hazard are required to help direct future lead design and also to inform decision making on lead replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to perform a comprehensive analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential predictors in a multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 3169 Sprint Fidelis leads were implanted in 11 centers with a total of 251 failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lead failure rates at 3, 4, and 5 years were 5.3%, 10.6%, and 16.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of lead failure continues to accelerate (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 independent predictors of failure: center, sex, access vein, and previous lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had a higher hazard of failure (hazard ratio 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.04; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both axillary and subclavian access increased the hazard of failure (P=0.007); hazard ratio for axillary was 1.94, (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.04) and for subclavian 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous lead failure increased the hazard of a subsequent Fidelis failure with a hazard ratio of 3.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.80-5.41; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of Fidelis failure continues to increase over time, with failures approaching 17% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women, patients with leads inserted via the subclavian or axillary vein, and those with a previous lead fracture were at greatest risk of Fidelis failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that Fidelis replacement should be strongly considered at the time of generator replacement </plain></SENT>
