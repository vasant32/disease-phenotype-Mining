<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which these mutant proteins cause disease is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimentally, cardiac troponin I (CTnI) gene mutations mainly alter myocardial performance via increases in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used an integrated simulation that links electrophysiology, contractile activity and energy metabolism of the myocardium to investigate alterations in myocardial contractile function and energy metabolism regulation as a result of increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in CTnI mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulation results reproduced the following typical features of FHC: (1) slower relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) caused by prolonged [Ca(2+)](i) and force transients; (2) higher energy consumption with the increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity; and (3) reduced fatty acid oxidation and enhanced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in hypertrophied heart metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the simulation indicated that in conditions of high energy consumption (that is, more than an 18.3% increase in total energy consumption), the myocardial energetic metabolic network switched from a net consumer to a net producer of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, resulting in a low coupling of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation to glycolysis, which is a common feature of hypertrophied hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides a novel systematic myocardial contractile and metabolic analysis to help elucidate the pathogenesis of FHC and suggests that the alterations in resting heart energy supply and demand could contribute to disease progression </plain></SENT>
