<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown the importance of dystrophin-associated protein complex in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated to vascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vascular endothelium, dystrophin is substituted for utrophin (autosomal homolog of dystrophin); however, its role in this tissue is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to obtain a more extensive knowledge of utrophin and its associated proteins in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we demonstrated the presence of utrophin-associated protein complex (UAPC) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC, which interacts with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, some of our observations suggested the presence of this complex in distinct membrane domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the UAPC in caveolae and non-caveolae <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts domains of HUVEC at baseline and with a mechanical stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated, by subcellular fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, the association of UAPC with Cav-1 and eNOS in caveolae domains, as well as its interaction with eNOS in non-caveolae <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it was also observed that mechanical stress on endothelial cells induced activation and release of eNOS from both caveolae and non-caveolae <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft associated to UAPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together these results suggest that UAPC located in caveolae and non-caveolae <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft domains of HUVECs may have a mechanosensory function that could participate in the control of eNOS activity </plain></SENT>
