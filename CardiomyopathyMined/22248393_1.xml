<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the dystrophin gene leading to a complete loss of the protein cause Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (DMD), frequently associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early clinical trials in DMD using gene transfer to skeletal muscle are underway, but gene transfer to dystrophic cardiac muscle has not yet been tested in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop an optimized protocol for cardiac gene therapy in the mouse model of dystrophin deficiency (mdx), using a cardiac promoter for expression of a microdystrophin (μDys) transgene packaged into an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector (AAV9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study adult mdx mice were intravenously injected with 1×10(12) genomic particles of AAV9 vectors carrying a cDNA encoding μDys under the control of either a ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or a cardiac-specific CMV-enhanced myosin light chain (MLC0.26) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 10 months, both AAV9 vectors led to sustained μDys expression in cardiac muscle, but the MLC promoter conferred about 4-fold higher protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AAV9-CMV-MLC0.26-μDys resulted in significant protection of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function as assessed by histopathology, echocardiography, and left ventricular catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we established an AAV9-mediated gene transfer approach for efficient and specific long-term μDys expression in the hearts of mdx mice, resulting in a sustained therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, this approach might be a basis for further translation into a treatment strategy for DMD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
