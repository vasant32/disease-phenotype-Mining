<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however, few data exploring this relationship in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study addresses this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between baseline resting heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was examined in 11,140 patients who participated in the Action in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular Disease</z:e>: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher resting heart rate was associated with a significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (fully adjusted HR 1.15 per 10 bpm [95% CI 1.08, 1.21], p&lt;0.001), cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and major cardiovascular outcomes without adjustment and after adjusting for age and sex and multiple covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased risk associated with a higher baseline resting heart rate was most obvious in patients with previous macrovascular complications (fully adjusted HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 1.79 for upper [mean 91 bpm] vs lowest [mean 58 bpm] fifth of resting heart rate in this subgroup [95% CI 1.28, 2.50], p = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Among patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a higher resting heart rate is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether a higher heart rate directly mediates the increased risk or is a marker for other factors that determine a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
