<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current model for amyloid fibril formation involves initial dissociation of the native TTR tetramer into non-native monomers which associate into soluble oligomers and protofibrils that evolve to mature amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of efforts are addressed to identify small molecules targeting the formation, clearance, or assembly of toxic aggregates as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review classifies and summarizes the different strategies and assays that have been developed in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo as tools to screen libraries of compounds or to test compounds from rational design in the search of drug candidates for the treatment of TTR-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on the property they measure, the assays are classified as: a) in vitro assays that monitor protein aggregation and/or fibril formation, b) in vitro assays that monitor binding to native protein, c) ex vivo TTR plasma selectivity assays, d) in vitro assays for tetrameric TTR stabilization, e) cellular assays, and f) animal models to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> inhibitors </plain></SENT>
