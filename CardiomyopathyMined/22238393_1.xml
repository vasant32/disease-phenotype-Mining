<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently released data from the French part of the European Union Safety and Appropriateness of GH treatments in Europe (EU SAGhE) study have raised concerns on the long-term safety of GH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report preliminary data on long-term vital status and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> or born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> treated with GH during childhood, in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Data were retrieved from national registries of GH-treated patients and vital status from National Population Registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were retrieved from a National Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Register (Sweden), Federal and Regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Registries (Belgium), or individual patient records (The Netherlands) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> or born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> started on recombinant GH during childhood from 1985-1997 and who had attained 18 yr of age by the end of 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vital status was available for approximately 98% of these 2,543 patients, corresponding to 46,556 person-years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vital status, causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, year of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, duration of GH treatment, and mean GH dose during treatment were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> identified, 12 were due to accidents, four were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicides</z:e>, and one patient each died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> dysfunction, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deficiency of humoral immunity</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defect</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these cohorts, the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (76%) were caused by accidents or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, none of the patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
