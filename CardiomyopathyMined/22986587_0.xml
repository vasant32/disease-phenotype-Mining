<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian complex V (F1F0-ATP synthase or ATPase) uses the proton gradient to generate ATP during oxidative phosphorylation and requires several helper proteins, including TMEM70, to form the holoenzyme in a stepwise process in which nuclear DNA is combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA-encoded subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical and molecular findings in three patients presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003535'>3-methylglutaconic aciduria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three showed an isolated defect of fully assembled ATP synthase in association with a "common" (c.317-2A &gt; G) and a new (c.628A &gt; C/p.T210P) variant in TMEM70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one of the patients also showed nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-responsive pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a finding never before associated with TMEM70 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to widening the clinical and mutational spectrum of defective ATP synthase, our study also suggests that mutant TMEM70 associates in high molecular weight complexes (470-550Â kDa) when expressed in Hela cells and exerts a direct action in ATP synthase biogenesis and assembly, mediating the incorporation of F1 moieties </plain></SENT>
