<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the detrimental effects are mediated by the phytoestrogens present in soy, the mechanism by which phytoestrogens act, and to test whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> modulates the sexually dimorphic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A soy-free diet (casein based) supplemented with the predominant phytoestrogens in soy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28197">daidzein</z:chebi>, recapitulated the fibrotic, proapoptotic and negative hemodynamic effects of soy in male hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with the soy diet, the hearts of female HCM mice were not negatively affected by the phytoestrogen-containing diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the sex differences mediated by diet in HCM, gonadectomies were performed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> was administered to male and female HCM mice on a casein- or phytoestrogen-supplemented diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Somewhat surprisingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> was not protective in male or female mice with HCM and, in fact, was lethal in phytoestrogen-fed male mice with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> is a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> and tyrosine kinase inhibition has been associated with cardiotoxicity, we tested its effects in isolated adult cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> inhibited different tyrosine kinases depending on sex and, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> only in adult male cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that phytoestrogens led to distinct programs of gene expression in hearts from males vs. females with HCM, suggesting mechanisms by which males are more sensitive to the detrimental effects of phytoestrogens and females are protected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results implicate the phytoestrogen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> in mediating cardiac pathology in males with HCM and, importantly, establish that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> is not protective in the setting of HCM </plain></SENT>
