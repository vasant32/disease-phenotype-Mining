<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the last 20 years, improvement in stent technology and operators experience explained the increased number of reports on the results of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for the treatment of left main (LM) coronary artery lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent data comparing efficacy and safety of PCIs using drug-eluting stent and coronary artery bypass surgery showed comparable results in terms of safety and a lower need for repeat revascularization for coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient selection for both techniques is fundamental and directly impacts the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further randomized trials must be conducted to precise the indications of both techniques of revascularization in the treatment of LM disease </plain></SENT>
