<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A research-based pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> registry identified familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 30% of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these results predated clinical genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the prevalence of familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 83 consecutive unrelated patients referred for genetic evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from 2006 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of probands (n = 63) were categorized as familial, syndromic, or metabolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent (n = 18) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) patients had mutations in sarcomeric genes, with MYH7 and MYBPC3 mutations predominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Syndromic (17%; n = 7) and metabolic (26%; n = 11) causes were frequently identified in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metabolic subgroup was differentiated by decreased endocardial shortening fraction on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) patients had similar rates of syndromic (20%; n = 5) and metabolic (16%; n = 4) causes, but fewer familial cases (24%; n = 6) compared with HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is identifiable in a majority of affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An underlying metabolic or syndromic cause is identified in &gt;35% of children with HCM or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of etiology is important for management, family-based risk assessment, and screening </plain></SENT>
