<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features, time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and severity can vary greatly among different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of the phenotypes are often not present in infancy but develop throughout childhood and adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recessively inherited mutations in ALMS1 gene are considered to be responsible for the causation of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Musculoskeletal manifestations including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> have been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Here, we present a patient with AS who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> due to extensive flowing ossification of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments of the cervical spine resulting in cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of an auto-fused spine in an acceptable sagittal alignment, in the background of a constellation of medical comorbidities, which necessitated a less morbid surgical approach, favored a posterior cervical laminectomy decompression in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient showed significant neurological recovery with improved function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI showed substantial enlargement of the spinal canal with improved space available for the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rarity of the syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> due to ossified posterior longitudinal ligament as a disease phenotype and the treatment considerations for performing a posterior cervical decompression have been discussed in this Grand Rounds' case presentation </plain></SENT>
