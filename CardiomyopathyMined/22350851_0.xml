<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the mutation is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a causal gene, the desmoplakin gene (DSP) has so far been identified; it encodes an essential component of desmosomes, a cell-cell structure aimed at keeping cells attached to each other in tissues in which cells are often exposed to strong shear forces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, familial cases of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> Carvajal syndrome were documented with a new feature: hypo/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000677'>oligodontia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mutation in the DSP gene was also evidenced in these latter cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A patient was seen for cardiogenetic consultation at the University Hospital of Lyon with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011705'>first degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>, non-compaction of the apex of the left ventricle and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A coronarography disclosed a complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the right coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At examination, he had also <z:hpo ids='HP_0002224'>woolly hair</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000972'>palmoplantar keratosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006349'>missing teeth</z:hpo> (essentially molars and premolars) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His family history was uninformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His DNA was screened for mutations in the DSP and plakoglobin genes but no mutation could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that Carvajal syndrome with hypo/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000677'>oligodontia</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition in which genes other than DSP might be involved, although we cannot rule out a mutation in this gene consisting in a deletion of a single exon or a gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
