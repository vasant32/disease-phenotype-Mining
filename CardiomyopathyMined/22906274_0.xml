<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the myocardially protective effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza injection in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-induced diabetic rats and the possible mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups (n = 10 per group): <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, no treatment (Sm-); <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, S. miltiorrhiza injection (Sm+); control (no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; saline treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After model induction and 4 weeks' treatment, heart function of five rats from each group was tested by Langendorff isolated in vivo heart perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining rats, pathological changes of the myocardium were observed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, and protein levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were assessed by immuno histo chemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular systolic end pressure and left ventricular developed pressure were significantly improved in the Sm+ group compared with the Sm- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes were ameliorated through significantly reduced TSP-1 and TGF-β1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S. miltiorrhiza injection may improve the heart function of diabetic rats and protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> by downregulating TSP-1 and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissue </plain></SENT>
