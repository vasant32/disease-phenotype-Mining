<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For the last decade continuous efforts have been made to translate regenerative cell therapy protocols in the cardiovascular field from 'bench to bedside' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful clinical introduction, supporting safety, and feasibility of this new therapeutic approach, led to the initiation of the German, Phase III, multicenter trial - termed the PERFECT trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00950274), in order to evaluate the efficacy of surgical cardiac cell therapy on left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The PERFECT trial has been designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial, analyzing the effect of intramyocardial CD 133(+) bone marrow stem cell injection in combination with coronary artery bypass grafting on postoperative left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trial includes patients aged between 18 and 79 years presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> with indication for surgical revascularization and reduced global left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by cardiac magnet resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The included patients are treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in combination with intramyocardial CD133+ cell injection will have a higher LV ejection fraction than patient who undergo CABG alone, measured 6 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00950274 </plain></SENT>
