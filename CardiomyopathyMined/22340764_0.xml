<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The miniaturization of a 3-dimensional transducer permitting its extension to transesophageal mode rapidly expanded its use in a variety of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent development of user-friendly automated/semiautomated cropping and display software may make it rather simple, even for the novice to gather useful information from RT3DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss the background, technique, and cutting-edge research and novel clinical applications of advanced RT3DE, including left ventricular dyssynchrony assessment, 3-D speckle tracking, myocardial contrast echocardiography, complete 4-dimensional (4-D) shape and motion analysis of the left ventricle, 4-D volumetric analysis of the right ventricle, 3-D volume rendering of the mitral valve, and other percutaneous and surgical procedural applications </plain></SENT>
