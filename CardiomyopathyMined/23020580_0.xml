<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiomyocyte reticular network is the ideal location of sensors for both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that disrupt energy and/or nutrient homeostasis and lead to ER stress, a disturbance in ER function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ER stress has been linked to both physiological and pathological states in the cardiovascular system; such states include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, oxygen starvation (<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) and fuel starvation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, pressure overload, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ER stress coping response (e.g., the unfolded protein response) is composed of discrete pathways that are controlled by a collection of common regulatory components that may function as a single entity involved in reacting to ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These corrective strategies allow the cardiomyocyte reticular network to restore energy and/or nutrient homeostasis and to avoid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the identities of the ER stress corrective strategies are important targets for the development of therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular and other acquired disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> Volume 75 is February 10, 2013 </plain></SENT>
