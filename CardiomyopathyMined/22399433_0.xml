<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the clinical use of these potent chemotherapeutics is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that irreversibly evolves toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms responsible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> anticancer activity as well as those underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-induced cardiotoxicity are incompletely understood and remain a matter of remarkable controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">Anthracyclines</z:chebi> have long been considered to induce cardiotoxicity by mechanisms different from those mediating their anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> antitumor efficacy is associated with nuclear DNA intercalation, topoisomerase II inhibition and drug-DNA adducts formation, whereas the cardiotoxicity is prevalently ascribed to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At present, however, the view that distinct mechanisms are implied in anticancer and cardiotoxic responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> therapy does not seem fully convincing since beneficial (anticancer) and detrimental (cardiotoxic) effects are to some extent overlapping, share the subcellular organelle targets, the molecular effectors and the pathophysiological processes (i.e. DNA strand breaks, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, signalling pathways, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunctions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> etc.).Here, we review the potential role of mitochondria in the molecular mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> anticancer activity as well as in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-induced cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
