<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding the myosin-6 heavy chain and changes in the cellular abundance of the protein have been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a detailed kinetic characterization of the human myosin-6 motor domain, describe the effect of 2,4,6-triiodophenol on the interaction of myosin-6 with F-actin and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, and show how addition of the drug reduces the number of myosin-6-dependent vesicle fusion events at the plasma membrane during constitutive secretion </plain></SENT>
