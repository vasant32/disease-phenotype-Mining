<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an important proportion of patients with HCM, the site and extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> results in severe obstruction to LV outflow tract (LVOT), contributing to disabling symptoms and increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with progressive and/or refractory symptoms despite optimal pharmacological treatment, invasive therapies that diminish or abolish LVOT obstruction relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-related symptoms, improve quality of life and could be associated with long-term survival similar to that observed in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gold standard in this respect is surgical septal myectomy, which might be supplementary associated with a reduction in SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous techniques, particularly alcohol septal ablation (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and more recently radiofrequency (RF) septal ablation, can achieve LVOT gradient reduction and symptomatic benefit in a large proportion of HOCM patients at the cost of a supposedly limited septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> and a 10-20% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After an initial period of enthusiasm, standard <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacing failed to show in randomized trials significant LVOT gradient reductions and objective improvement in exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, case reports and recent small pilot studies suggested that atrial synchronous LV or biventricular (biV) pacing significantly reduce LVOT obstruction and improve symptoms (acutely as well as long-term) in a large proportion of severely symptomatic HOCM patients not suitable to other gradient reduction therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, biV/LV pacing in HOCM seems to be associated with significant LV reverse remodelling </plain></SENT>
