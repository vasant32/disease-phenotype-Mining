<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined potential involvement of calcineurin in the pathogenesis of HCM caused by mutations in myozenin 2 (MYOZ2), an inhibitor of calcineurin.Methods and ResultsWe generated multiple lines of transgenic mice expressing either Flag-tagged <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (MYOZ2(WT)) or mutant MYOZ2(S48P) and MYOZ2(I246M), identified in families with HCM, in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To mimic the human genotype, we generated bigenic mice expressing WT and mutant MYOZ2 in the background of hemizgous endogenous MYOZ2 (Myoz2(+/-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transgene proteins constituted 15 to 48% of the total MYOZ2 protein in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutant MYOZ2 mice showed molecular, cellular and gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, preserved systolic function and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining showed co-localization of WT and mutant MYOZ2 proteins with Î±-ACTININ at the Z disks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed disrupted and mal-aligned Z disks in the mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac calcineurin activity, determined by quantifying Rcan1.4 mRNA and protein levels, luciferase activity in triple transgenic Myoz2(+/-):NFATc-Luc:MYOZ2(I246M) and Myoz2(+/-):NFATc-Luc:MYOZ2(WT) mice, and NFATc transcriptional activity assay, was unchanged in the mutant transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and JNK54/46 were altered in the transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, lentiviral-mediated expression of the MYOZ2(I246M) did not affect RCAN1.4 and calcineurin (PPP3CB) protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, cardiac phenotype in HCM caused by MYOZ2 mutations might be independent of calcineurin activity in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Z disks abnormalities might provide the stimulus for the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> caused by MYOZ2 mutations </plain></SENT>
