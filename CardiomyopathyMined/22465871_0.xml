<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although LV twist is known to be load dependent in healthy volunteers, this has not been examined in patients with "long-standing" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether LV twist remains load dependent in the setting of long-standing, nonischemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with baseline LV ejection fractions (LVEFs) &lt; 40% and 13 subjects with preserved LVEFs (≥50%) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After baseline measurements, pneumatic compression of the lower extremities (Pcom) was used to increase LV afterload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, sublingual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (SL-NG) was administered to modify preload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional echocardiographic parameters, LV end-systolic wall stress, net LV twist angle, and apex-to-base-rotation delay (ABRD) were assessed under each condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, although LV end-systolic wall stress significantly increased under Pcom (196.9 ± 64.9 g/m(2) at baseline vs 231.8 ± 78.9 g/m(2) under Pcom, P &lt; .017) and decreased after SL-NG application (231.8 ± 78.9 g/m(2) under Pcom vs 197.4 ± 67.4 g/m(2) after SL-NG, P &lt; .017), net LV twist angle and ABRD showed no significant changes depending on LV loading condition (for LV twist, 7.63 ± 4.47° at baseline vs 7.03 ± 4.13° under Pcom vs 7.35 ± 4.36° after SL-NG, P = 0.65; for ABRD, 16.56 ± 13.81% at baseline vs 17.19 ± 14.81% under Pcom vs 15.95 ± 13.27% after SL-NG, P = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of individual patient data revealed that LV twist was load independent when patients had LV twist &lt; 12° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ABRD was also found to be load independent, but only in patients with LVEFs &lt; 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LV twist and ABRD were load dependent in patients with preserved LVEFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LV twist and its component, ABRD, had relatively load insensitive properties in patients with long-standing <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and can be used in future clinical trials as load-independent indexes of LV dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
