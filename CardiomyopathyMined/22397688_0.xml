<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we extend microscale thermophoresis to target immunological questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optically generated thermal gradients were used to deplete fluorescently marked antigens in 2- and 10-fold-diluted human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We devised and validated an autocompetitive strategy to independently fit the concentration and dissociation constant of autoimmune antibodies against the cardiac Î²1-adrenergic receptor related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an artificial antigen, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> COR1 was designed to mimic the second extracellular receptor loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thermophoresis resolved antibody concentrations from 2 to 200 nM and measured the dissociation constant as 75 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The approach quantifies antibody binding in its native serum environment within microliter volumes and without any surface attachments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of the mix and probe protocol minimizes systematic errors, making thermophoresis a promising detection method for personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
