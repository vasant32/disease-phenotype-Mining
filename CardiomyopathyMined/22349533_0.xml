<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy induces several changes which together increase the hemodynamic burden on the cardiovascular system and can also cause a prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, latent or apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> can acutely decompensate during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a cardiovascular perspective, pregnancies are most often complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to potential fetal harm conventional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are limited by the restricted use of radiogenic cardiac imaging and applicable medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, knowledge about available therapeutic options is of greatest importance, since guideline recommendations have clearly been demonstrated to reduce morbidity and mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac emergencies during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
