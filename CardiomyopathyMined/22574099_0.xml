<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pericardial Diseases</z:e> classified LV noncompaction as an unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>noncompaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> characterized by the following features: 1) an altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity, without evidence of communication with the epicardial coronary artery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Features of LV noncompaction can overlap with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (especially the apical variant), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic expression can vary considerably within the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LV noncompaction can rarely occur as a transient phenomenon during <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 23-year-old patient, admitted to our Department for cardiac evaluation because of ECG changes and cardiac enlargement revealed at thoracic radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxoplasmosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An echocardiography was performed revealing left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo> and signs of isolated left ventricular non-compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under these circumstances, we have considered the presence of isolated left ventricular non-compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed and it sustained the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The alternative cause of isolated left ventricular noncompaction (prominent trabeculation due to myocardial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxoplasmosis</z:e>) was considered improbable </plain></SENT>
