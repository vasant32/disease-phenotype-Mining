<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a marker of myocardial injury and a surrogate marker of myocardial dysfunction in adults, but there are few data in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare serum cTnI concentrations with clinical severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and with duration of inotropic support in asphyxiated neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of 60 neonates admitted with hypoxic-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (HIE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cTnI concentrations measured within 36 h of birth were compared with clinical grade of HIE (Sarnat-Sarnat classification) and with duration of inotropic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum cTnI concentrations and duration of inotropic support were significantly greater with increasing severity of HIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median (95% CI) cTnI concentrations were 0.04 μg/L (0.02-0.07 μg/L) in grade 1 HIE, 0.12 μg/L (0.08-0.20 μg/L) in grade 2 HIE and 0.67 μg/L (0.41-1.35 μg/L) in grade 3 HIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median (95% CI) duration of inotropic support required was 0 h (0-24 h) in grade 1 HIE, 28 h (0-118 h) in grade 2 HIE and 48 h (0-140 h) in grade 3 HIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In asphyxiated neonates, cTnI concentrations within 36 h of birth correlate strongly with clinical grade of HIE and with duration of inotropic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early cTnI concentrations may provide a useful proxy marker for the anticipated severity of myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
