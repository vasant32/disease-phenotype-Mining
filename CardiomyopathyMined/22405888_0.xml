<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The last 2 decades have seen impressive results in its application against haemato-oncologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> and prostate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular immunotherapy has since found applicability beyond <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and continues to expand in its clinical applicability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discovery that stem cells have the ability to differentiate into more mature cell types, like neurones and myocardium, has focused research on using exogenous cells to repair damaged tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This led to numerous clinical trials using stem cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and spinal cord damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results have ranged from modest to significant clinical outcomes with continuing debate on the exact process of regeneration achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intertwining between cell therapy and transfusion medicine now includes research on progenitor cells for the production of mature red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is also clear that cell therapy has enabled an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of many diseases, while perhaps its role in regenerative medicine is most enticing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the critical role of manufacturing in terms of cost, complexity, reproducibility, and regulatory matters remains a central issue in the consideration of whether cell therapy has met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of its promise </plain></SENT>
