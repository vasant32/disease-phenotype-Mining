<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> on AGE formation in patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Heart tissue specimens from 136 patients undergoing transplantation were grouped as follows: 14 cases of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, 67 cases of ICM without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, and 47 cases of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen heart samples were from the autopsies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and 20 heart samples were from organ donors in whom the heart was wasted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AGE deposits were localized immunohistochemically counted using a semiquantitative scale and characterized by their staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive staining was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples from both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> groups with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, in 71% of healthy hearts from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> subjects, in 51% of ICM non-diabetic hearts, and in 38% of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> non-diabetic hearts, and in only 15% of the organ donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mixed-diffuse and granular AGE patterns were characteristic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>, while a diffuse pattern was more frequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The semiquantitative results supported increased AGE accumulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The amount of AGE in cardiomyocytes increases significantly in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, with a staining pattern typical for each condition </plain></SENT>
