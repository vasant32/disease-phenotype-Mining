<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Determining the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> will help us gain better insight into the most costly health problem in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the roles that the actin protein plays in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, we have taken a systematic approach toward characterizing human cardiac actin mutants that have been associated with either hypertrophic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven known cardiac actin mutants were expressed in a baculovirus system, and their intrinsic properties were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, the changes to the properties of the actin proteins themselves were subtle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The R312H variant exhibited reduced stability, with a T(m) of 53.6 °C compared to 56.8 °C for WT actin, accompanied with increased polymerization critical concentration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> release rate, and a marked increase in nucleotide release rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substitution of methionine for leucine at amino acid 305 showed no impact on the stability, nucleotide release rates, or DNase-I inhibition ability of the actin monomer; however, during polymerization, a 2-fold increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> release was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases to both the T(m) and DNase-I inhibition activity suggested interactions between E99K actin molecules under monomer-promoting conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Y166C actin had a higher critical concentration resulting in a lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> release rate due to reduced filament-forming potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The locations of mutations on the ACTC protein correlated with the molecular effects; in general, mutations in subdomain 3 affected the stability of the ACTC protein or affect the polymerization of actin filaments, while mutations in subdomains 1 and 4 more likely affect protein-protein interactions </plain></SENT>
