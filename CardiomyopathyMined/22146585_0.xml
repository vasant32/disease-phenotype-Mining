<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are evidences that the activation of AMPK is playing pivotal role in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that both the AMPK and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi> acts as a negative regulator for each protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been well proven that the MAPK cascade could be modulated by the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, studies were shown that p38 MAPK stimulates <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake through the AMPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculate and tried to demonstrate that the modulation of AT-R/MAPK pathway through AMPK might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, using the transgenic (Spontaneous Diabetic Torii-SDT) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed Western blot analysis for the measurement of myocardial AT-R, AMPK and MAPK cascades-related protein expressions, p67-phox and caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we employed dihydroethidium (DHE), Azan Mallory and hemotoxylin eosin (HE) staining methods to demonstrate the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical production, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein expressions, such as AT-1R, p-ERK1/2, p67-phox and caspase-12 were found to be significantly increased and conversely, the Ang-(1-7) mas R, Tak1, LKB1 and p-AMPKÎ±1, p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK protein expressions were found to be considerably decreased in the SDT rats, in comparison to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DHE, Azan Mallory and HE stainings also revealed that the SDT rats have more <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical production, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, respectively than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is suggested that the modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
