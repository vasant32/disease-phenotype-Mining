<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AimsHereditary transthyretin (TTR)-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (ATTR) is mainly considered a neurologic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of ATTR in a Caucasian area and evaluated the prevalence, genetic background, and disease profile of cases with an exclusively cardiac phenotype, highlighting possible hints for the differential diagnosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and senile systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (SSA).Methods and resultsIn this Italian multicentre study, 186 patients with ATTR were characterized at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with SSA and 30 age-gender-matched HCM patients were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotype was classified as exclusively cardiac (n = 31, 17%), exclusively neurologic (n = 46, 25%), and mixed cardiac/neurologic (n = 109, 58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the eight different mutations responsible for an exclusively cardiac phenotype, Ile68Leu was the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients with an exclusively cardiac phenotype developed mild abnormalities at neurological examination, but no symptoms during a 36-month follow-up (range: 14-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exclusively cardiac phenotype was characterized by male gender, age &gt;65 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms, symmetric left ventricular (LV) '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>', and moderately depressed LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This profile was similar to SSA, but relatively distinct from HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with a mixed phenotype, patients with an exclusively cardiac phenotype showed a more pronounced cardiac involvement on both echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG).ConclusionA clinically relevant subset of Caucasian ATTR patients present with an exclusively cardiac phenotype, mimicking HCM or SSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic and ECG findings are useful to differentiate ATTR from HCM but not from SSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of liver transplantation in these patients should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
