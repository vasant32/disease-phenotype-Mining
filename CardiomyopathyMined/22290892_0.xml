<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> can result in severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and is associated with an up to 20% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (which is substantially lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> are complex and depend on the functional status of the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> can occur in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population, but is typically observed in patients with HCM or following MV repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography (2D, 3D and stress) has a central diagnostic role as the application of echocardiographic <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> predictors allows the incorporation of prevention techniques during surgery and post-operative <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has a special role in understanding the dynamic nature of <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>, especially in anatomically atypical hearts (including HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article describes what the clinician needs to know about <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> ranging from pathophysiological mechanisms and imaging modalities to conservative (medical) and surgical approaches and their respective outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A stepwise approach is advocated consisting of medical therapy, followed by aggressive volume loading and beta-adrenoceptor blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery is the final option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correct choice of surgical technique requires an understanding of the anatomical substrate of <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
