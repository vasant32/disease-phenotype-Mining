<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This cross-sectional study provides a practical approach for the clinical assessment of Friedreich <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (FA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (FA-CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A comprehensive cardiac assessment, including standard echocardiography, color Doppler myocardial imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, ECG, and exercise stress testing, was performed in 205 FA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> in FA-CM, the end-diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness (IVSTd) was found to be the best echocardiographic parameter compared with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-determined left ventricular mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the use of this parameter, 4 groups of patients with FA-CM could be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for IVSTd (31.7%) were classified as having no FA-CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with an IVSTd exceeding the predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IVSTd were classified as having mild FA-CM (40%) if IVSTd exceeded the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value by &lt;18% or as having intermediate FA-CM (16.1%) if IVSTd exceeded the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value by â‰¥18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ejection fraction &lt;50% were classified as having severe FA-CM (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to increased myocardial mass, severe FA-CM was further characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the left ventricle, reduced systolic strain rate of the posterior wall, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regional myocardial function correlated negatively with FA-CM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger patients had a tendency for more advanced FA-CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no clear correlation was found between FA-CM groups and neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide and describe a readily applicable clinical grouping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated with FA based on echocardiographic IVSTd and ejection fraction data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because no distinct interrelations between FA-CM and neurological status could be determined, regular follow-up of potential cardiac involvement in FA patients is essential in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
