<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although metabolic exercise testing is routinely used in the evaluation of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, data on the prognostic information that can be derived from such testing in HC is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 182 patients (mean age 53 ± 15 years; 65% men) with obstructive HC and minimal or no cardiovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent maximum exercise testing with simultaneous metabolic gas exchange measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (mean 4.0 ± 3.0 years; 100% complete) was performed to determine the vital status and occurrence of severe symptoms, defined as class III or IV symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple parameters of metabolic exercise were associated with a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the development of severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses, the independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe symptoms were the severity of the left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and the percentage of predicted peak myocardial oxygen consumption achieved during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with a percentage of predicted peak myocardial oxygen consumption of &lt;60%, the 4-year survival rate free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe symptoms was only 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, among patients with obstructive HC and mild or no symptoms, a low metabolic exercise capacity is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the subsequent development of severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
