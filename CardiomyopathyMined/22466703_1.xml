<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By positional cloning using a previously characterized rat strain with altered titin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding motif protein 20 (Rbm20) as the underlying cause of pathological titin isoform expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of Rbm20-deficient rats resembled the pathology seen in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by RBM20 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing of the human and rat cardiac transcriptome revealed an RBM20-dependent regulation of alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to titin (TTN), we identified a set of 30 genes with conserved splicing regulation between humans and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This network is enriched for genes that have previously been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, ion homeostasis and sarcomere biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies emphasize the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in cardiac function and provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
