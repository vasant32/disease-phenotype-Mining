<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed using an incremental cycling at 1 mo after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that our study subjects had obvious impairment in workload, oxygen consumption, and oxygen pulse at peak exercise and ventilatory threshold at 1 mo after orthotropic heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pediatric orthotropic heart transplantation recipients also showed a high resting heart rate (90-106 beats/min), a low peak heart rate (109-117 beats/min) during exercise, and continuous heart rate acceleration till 1 to 3 mins after the cessation of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pediatric orthotropic heart transplant recipients have a low cardiopulmonary endurance during the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An early structured, individualized cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program for pediatric orthotropic heart transplant recipients will be an area for future evaluation and research </plain></SENT>
