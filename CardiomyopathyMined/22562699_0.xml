<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of biopsy material demonstrates isolated or combined deficiency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain enzyme complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-occurrence of impaired activity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex has been rarely reported so far and is not yet fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated two siblings presenting with severe neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, and intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>; both died within the first months of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy revealed a peculiar biochemical defect consisting of a combined deficiency of respiratory chain complexes I, II, and II+III accompanied by a defect of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Joint exome analysis of both affected siblings uncovered a homozygous missense mutation in BOLA3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The causal role of the mutation was validated by lentiviral-mediated expression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> isoform of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> BOLA3 in patient fibroblasts, which lead to an increase of both residual enzyme activities and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that BOLA3 plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30408">iron-sulfur clusters</z:chebi> necessary for proper function of respiratory chain and 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24833">oxoacid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that broad sequencing approaches combined with appropriate prioritization filters and experimental validation enable efficient molecular diagnosis and have the potential to discover new disease loci </plain></SENT>
