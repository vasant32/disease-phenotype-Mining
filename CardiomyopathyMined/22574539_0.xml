<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited data on the correlation of measured heart rate at rest and during Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the proportion of achieved target heart rate between resting heart rate measuring and 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who receive rate control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who archived target resting heart rate under rate control strategy at Siriraj Hospital and who underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring were studied to evaluate the correlation between two methods of heart rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 47 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Underlying cardiac conditions were as follows: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> 44.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> 25%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> 17% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 12.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients (21.3%) whose achieving target resting heart rate was not correlated with 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6.4%) underwent permanent pacemaker implantation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients that receive rate control strategy, evaluation of only resting heart rate might not be enough for long-term evaluation and treatment and 24-hour monitoring may be an additional helpful test in order to more precisely adjust medication for long-term treatment and detection of SSS </plain></SENT>
