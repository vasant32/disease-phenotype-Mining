<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The (pro)renin-renin receptor [(P)RR] was discovered as an important novel component of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of (P)RR is widely studied in renal and vascular pathologies and has sparked interest for a potential role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of (P)RR in cardiac pathophysiology, we aimed to assess (P)RR regulation in adverse cardiac remodelling of the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, we evaluated the expression of (P)RR in different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and across different species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased levels of (P)RR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in post-myocardial infarcted (MI) hearts of rats (1.6-fold, P &lt; 0.05) and mice (5-fold, P &lt; 0.01), as well as in transgenic rats with overexpression of the mouse renin gene (Ren2) (2.2-fold, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed a strong increase of (P)RR expression in hearts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) patients (5.3-fold, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because none of the tested commercially available antibodies appeared to detect endogenous (P)RR, a (P)RR-specific polyclonal antibody was generated to study (P)RR protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(P)RR protein levels were significantly increased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> rat heart (1.4-fold, P &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients, a significant 8.7-fold (P &lt; 0.05) increase was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, protein expression paralleled gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that (P)RR expression is strongly up-regulated both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and in the failing human heart, hinting to a potential role for (P)RR in cardiac pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
