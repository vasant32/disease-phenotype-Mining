<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A total of 144 patients (112 men, 32 women; mean age 40.2±14.3 years) underwent cardiac transplantation between February 1998 and January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups; hence, 63 patients (group 1; mean age 42.5±12.6 years) receiving transplantation up to January 2006, and 81 patients (group 2; mean age 38.4±15.3 years) receiving transplantation from 2006 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter period, a ventricular assist device was used in 17 patients before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was the main cause of heart transplantation in both groups (71.4% vs. 74.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality, in-hospital mortality (&lt;30 days), and late mortality (≥30 days) rates were 39.6% (n=57), 13.9% (n=20), and 25.7% (n=37), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival rates for 1, 2, 5, and 10 years were 76%, 69%, 59%, and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second group had significantly lower rates of overall mortality and late mortality compared to group 1 (29.6% vs. 52.4%, p=0.005; 16.0% vs. 38.1%, p=0.002, respectively), whereas early mortality rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were also higher in the second group, but these differences did not reach significance (1-year, 76.1% vs. 74.6%; 2-year, 73.0% vs. 65.1%; 5-year, 63.8% vs. 55.6%; log rank 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (30.3% vs. 33.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo> (12.1% vs. 29.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (15.2% vs. 16.7%) were the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that overall and late mortality rates show significant decreases in cardiac transplant patients from 1998 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
