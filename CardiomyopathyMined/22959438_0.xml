<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in sport activity whose autopsy was performed in forensic department of Tunis, between January 2005 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During study period, 32 cases of SD in sport activity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are amateur athletes predominantly male (84% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Victims are aged between 15 and 79years with an average age of about 33.16years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Young subjects whose age is less than 35years representing 68.7% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>9.3% of victims had a family history of SD and 18.7% of cases had a known cardiac history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sports most involved are running (40.6% of cases), football (31.3% of cases) and dance (12.5% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of victims died during sports activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of witnesses was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; however, none of these witnesses has begun resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was cardiac in 84.4% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In young athletes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is the leading cause (nine cases), followed by arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among other causes, there is the myocardial bridge, congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Beyond 35years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery diseases</z:hpo> represent the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (nine cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> occurred after a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In four cases (12.5%), no cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was identified after a complete autopsy accompanied by further investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was imputed to a rhythmic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study dealing with autopsy in SD in sport have provided a specific profile of victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Other studies on larger samples and using standardized autopsy protocols are needed </plain></SENT>
