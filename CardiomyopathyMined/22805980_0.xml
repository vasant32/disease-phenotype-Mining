<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that vortex ring formation during left ventricular (LV) rapid filling is an optimized mechanism for blood transport, and that the volume of the vortex ring is an important measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to lack of quantitative methods, the volume of the vortex ring has not previously been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) is a new flow analysis method, which enables in vivo quantification of vortex ring volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to investigate if vortex ring volume in the human LV can be reliably quantified using LCS and magnetic resonance velocity mapping (4D PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities were measured using 4D PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in 9 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with dilated ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV LCS were computed from flow velocities and manually delineated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vortex volume in the healthy volunteers was 51 ± 6% of the LV volume, and 21��± 5% in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variability was -1 ± 13% and interstudy variability was -2 ± 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to idealized flow experiments, the vortex rings showed additional complexity and asymmetry, related to endocardial trabeculation and papillary muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LCS and 4D PC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> enables measurement of vortex ring volume during rapid filling of the LV </plain></SENT>
