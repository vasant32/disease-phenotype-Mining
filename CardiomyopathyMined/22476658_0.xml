<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is heredo-familial, and mutations in desmosomal genes have been identified in about half of patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlations, including magnetic resonance and pathology studies on heart specimens, are currently demonstrating that the spectrum of the disease is wider than initially thought and usually referred to with the adjective "right ventricular", with the evidence of biventricular or even isolated left ventricular forms, so that it is increasingly identified simply as "arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A revision of the diagnostic criteria encompassing familial, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, morpho-functional and histopathologic findings, has been made to improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, in particular of the concealed forms and left-dominant subtypes of the disease </plain></SENT>
