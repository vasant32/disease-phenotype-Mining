<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients presenting for pulmonary resection, additional effects resulting from positioning, 1-lung ventilation, surgical procedures, and contraction of the pulmonary vascular bed may impose an additional physiological burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For most patients with adequate pulmonary and cardiovascular reserve, these effects are well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist may be asked to provide <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> care for patients with significantly reduced cardiac function who require potentially curative pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients present a major perioperative challenge and a thoughtful approach to intraoperative management is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors review a case of a patient with severely impaired biventricular function who presented for elective pulmonary lobectomy in an attempt to effect a curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and present a discussion of physiological and pathophysiological considerations for clinical management </plain></SENT>
