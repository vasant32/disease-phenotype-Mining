<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: Systemic primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency (CDSP) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorder of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of CDSP can vary widely with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, organ involvement, and severity of symptoms, but are typically characterized by episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001985'>hypoketotic hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated transaminases</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> in infants; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003756'>skeletal myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>elevated creatine kinase</z:hpo> (CK), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in childhood; or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigability</z:mp> in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can be suspected on newborn screening, but is established by demonstration of low plasma free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> concentration (&lt;5 muM, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 25-50 muM), reduced fibroblast <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transport (&lt;10% of controls), and molecular testing of the SLC22A5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CDSP varies depending on ethnicity; however the frequency in the United States is estimated to be approximately 1 in 70,000 individuals based on newborn screening data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDSP is caused by recessive mutations in the SLC22A5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporter type 2 (OCTN2) which transport <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> across cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 100 mutations have been reported in this gene with the c.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36928">136C</z:chebi> &gt; T (p.P46S) mutation being the most frequent mutation identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDSP should be differentiated from secondary causes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency such as various organic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemias</z:hpo> and fatty acid oxidation defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CDSP is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> condition; therefore the recurrence risk in each pregnancy is 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carrier screening for at-risk individuals and family members should be obtained by performing targeted mutation analysis of the SLC22A5 gene since plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> analysis is not a sufficient methodology for determining carrier status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk of CDSP is possible by molecular genetic testing of extracted DNA from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis if both mutations in SLC22A5 gene are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once the diagnosis of CDSP is established in an individual, an echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, CK concentration, liver transaminanses measurement, and pre-prandial blood sugar levels, should be performed for baseline assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Primary treatment involves supplementation of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16347">levocarnitine</z:chebi> (L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>) at a dose of 50--400 mg/kg/day divided into three doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No formal surveillance guidelines for individuals with CDSP have been established to date, however the following screening recommendations are suggested: annual echocardiogram and electrocardiogram, frequent plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels, and CK and liver transaminases measurement can be considered during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adult women with CDSP who are planning to or are pregnant should meet with a metabolic or genetic specialist ideally before conception to discuss management of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels during pregnancy since <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels are typically lower during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for individuals with CDSP depends on the age, presentation, and severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis; however the long-term prognosis is favorable as long as individuals remain on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>
