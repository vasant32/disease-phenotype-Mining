<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, the current method of screening for treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> recommended by the Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group Guidelines, to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, the reference standard for left ventricular (LV) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, contemporaneous evaluation of LV structure and function by 2D and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography and CMR imaging in 114 adult survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> currently median age 39 years (range, 22 to 53 years) exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> chemotherapy and/or chest-directed radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this survivor population, 14% (n = 16) had an ejection fraction (EF) less than 50% by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survivors previously undiagnosed with cardiotoxicity (n = 108) had a high prevalence of EF (32%) and cardiac mass (48%) that were more than two standard deviations below the mean of normative CMR data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2D echocardiography overestimated the mean EF of this population by 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with CMR, 2D echocardiography (biplane method) had a sensitivity of 25% and a false-negative rate of 75% for detection of EF less than 50%, although 3D echocardiography had 53% and 47%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve survivors (11%) had an EF less than 50% by CMR but were misclassified as â‰¥ 50% (range, 50% to 68%) by 2D echocardiography (biplane method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was improved (sensitivity, 75%) by using a higher 2D echocardiography cutoff (EF &lt; 60%) to detect an EF less than 50% by the reference standard CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CMR identified a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> among adult survivors previously undiagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2D echocardiography demonstrated limited screening performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this high-risk population, survivors with an EF 50% to 59% by 2D echocardiography should be considered for comprehensive cardiac assessment, which may include CMR </plain></SENT>
