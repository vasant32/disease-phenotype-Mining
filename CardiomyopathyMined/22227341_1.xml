<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> (STICH) randomized trial was designed to identify an optimal management strategy for patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Baseline echocardiographic examinations were required for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this report is to describe the baseline STICH Echocardiography Core Laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim is to provide recommendations regarding how echocardiography should be used in clinical practice and research on the basis of the experience gained from echocardiography in STICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2002 and January 2006, 2,136 patients with ejection fractions (EFs) ≤ 35% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> amenable to coronary artery bypass grafting were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was acquired by 122 clinical enrolling sites, and measurements were performed by the Echocardiography Core Laboratory after a certification process for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Echocardiography was available for analysis in 2,006 patients (93.9%); 1,734 (86.4%) were men, and the mean age was 60.9 ± 9.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular end-systolic volume index, measureable in 72.8%, was 84.0 ± 30.9 mL/m(2), and the mean EF was 28.9 ± 8.3%, with 18.5% of patients having EFs &gt; 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single-plane measurements of left ventricular and left atrial volumes were similar to their volumes by biplane measurement (r = 0.97 and r = 0.92, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> severity by visual assessment was associated with a wide range of effective regurgitant orifice area, while effective regurgitant orifice area ≥ 0.2 cm(2) indicated at least moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> by visual assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deceleration time of mitral inflow velocity had a weak correlation with EF (r = 0.25) but was inversely related to estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = -0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In STICH patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, Echocardiography Core Laboratory analysis of baseline echocardiographic findings demonstrated a wide spectrum of left ventricular shape, function, and hemodynamics, as well as the feasibility and limitations of obtaining essential echocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is critical that the use of echocardiographic parameters in clinical practice and research balance the strengths and weaknesses of the technique </plain></SENT>
