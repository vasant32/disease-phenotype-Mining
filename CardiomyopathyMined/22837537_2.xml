<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA), which encodes A-type lamins, cause a diverse range of diseases collectively called laminopathies, the most common of which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggests that LMNA mutations cause disease by altering cell signaling pathways, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that the AKT-mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> pathway is hyperactivated in hearts of mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by Lmna mutation and that in vivo administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> analog temsirolimus prevents deterioration of cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show defective autophagy in hearts of these mice and demonstrate that improvement in heart function induced by pharmacological interventions is correlated with enhanced autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a rationale for treatment of LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with rapalogs and implicate defective autophagy as a pathogenic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> arising from LMNA mutation </plain></SENT>
