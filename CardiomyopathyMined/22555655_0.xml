<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The psychosocial consequences of genetic testing in this group are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This longitudinal pilot study sought to determine changes in health-related quality of life in patients and asymptomatic family members undergoing genetic testing for inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>.Methods:Individuals attending two specialized multidisciplinary cardiac genetic clinics in Australia were invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing proband or predictive genetic testing for an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or primary arrhythmogenic disorder were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (version 2) was administered before the genetic result was given, and follow-up surveys were completed 1-3, 6, and 12 months after the result was given.Results:A total of 54 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> completed baseline and at least one follow-up survey, including 33 probands and 21 asymptomatic relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physical and mental component scores analyzed at baseline and 1-3 months were found to be unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant differences were observed up to 12 months after result.Conclusion:In this longitudinal pilot study, no change in health-related quality of life was observed up to 12 months after the result was given in patients and their asymptomatic family members undergoing genetic testing for an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>.Genet Med 2012 advance online publication 3 May 2012 </plain></SENT>
