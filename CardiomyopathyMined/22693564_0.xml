<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: We have previously shown increased cardiac stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STC1 localizes to the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane and transgenic over-expression of STC1 is associated with increased energy utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the hypothesis that STC1 uncouples <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative phosphorylation--to suppress <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation and modulate neurohormonal effects on cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Compared to WT mouse heart, STC1 Tg heart displays: 2-fold higher uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) levels, but no effect on UCP2 protein; 40% lower ATP levels; but similar activities of respiratory chain complexes I-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cultured adult rat and freshly-isolated mouse cardiomyocytes, rSTC1 induces UCP3, but not UCP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cardiomyocytes with STC1 decreases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and suppresses baseline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>)-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation is higher in freshly-isolated adult UCP3(-/-) mouse cardiomyocytes compared to WT, suggesting an important role for UCP3 in regulating cardiomyocyte ROS under physiologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of UCP3(-/-) cardiomyocytes with rSTC1 failed to suppress <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation, suggesting that the effects of STC1 on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation in cardiomyocytes are UCP3-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STC1 activates a novel anti-oxidant pathway in cardiac myocytes through induction of UCP3, and may play an important role in suppressing ROS in the heart under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic conditions and ameliorate the deleterious effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-mediated cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our data point to a critical role for the mitochondria in regulating ROS generation in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
