<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) is predominantly caused by a large number of various mutations in the genes encoding sarcomeric proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, two prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations for HCM in the alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1-D175N) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3-Q1061X) genes have previously been identified in eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the prevalence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in a large population of patients with HCM from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We screened for two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations (TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X) in 306 unrelated Finnish patients with HCM from the regions covering a population of âˆ¼4,000,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TPM1-D175N mutation was found in 20 patients (6.5%) and the MYBPC3-Q1061X in 35 patients (11.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the two mutations accounted for 17.9% of the HCM cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, 61 and 59 relatives of the probands were found to be carriers of TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mutations showed regional clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TPM1-D175N was prevalent in central and western Finland, and MYBPC3-Q1061X in central and eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The TPM1-D175N and MYBPC3-Q1061X mutations account for a substantial part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HCM cases in the Finnish population, indicating that routine genetic screening of these mutations is warranted in Finnish patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
