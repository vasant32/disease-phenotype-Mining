<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Heart transplantation is the only viable treatment for children with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviewed the trends in the indications for transplant and survival after transplant during the past 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the 307 heart transplants performed at our center since 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze the trends in the indications for transplant as well as operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and late-survival, the data were divided into three periods in 8-year increments: 1986 to 1993 (50 patients), 1994 to 2001 (116 patients), and 2002 to 2009 (141 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The indications for transplantation were 39% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, 57% CHD, and 4% retransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 173 with CHD, 139 (80%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> (SV) anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CHD group, transplantation for failed SV palliation, including Fontan procedure, became the predominant indication in the last 8-year interval of our program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival after transplant was the best in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and the worst in patients with failed palliations for SV anomalies, including failed Fontan procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> related to failed SV palliation has become the most common indication for patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high-risk nature of these transplants will have significant implications for heart transplant programs as more infants with SV anomalies survive palliative procedures performed during infancy </plain></SENT>
