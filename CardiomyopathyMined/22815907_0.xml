<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mode of action is unclear since a sufficient and long-acting cardiac homing of MSCs is unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the regulation of the immune response in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> after intravenous application of MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wildtype</z:mp> mice were infected with CVB3 and treated with either PBS, human MSCs or human cardiac fibroblasts intravenously 1 day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, MSCs could be detected in the spleen, heart, pancreas, liver, lung and kidney, whereby the highest presence was observed in the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSCs increased significantly the myocardial expression of HGF and decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL1β and IL6 as well as the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and ameliorated the left ventricular dysfunction measured by conductance catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSCs upregulated the production of IFNγ in CD4+ and CD8+ cells, the number of IL10-producing regulatory T cells and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of T cells in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased number of CD4+CD25+FoxP3 could be found in the spleen as well as in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, application of human cardiac fibroblasts had no effect on the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and the systemic immune response observed after MSCs-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, modulation of the immune response in extracardiac organs is associated with cardiobeneficial effects in experimental inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after systemic application of MSCs </plain></SENT>
