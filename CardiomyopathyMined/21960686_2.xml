<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared a standard low-fat diet to high-fat diets enriched with either saturated fat (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25629">stearate</z:chebi>) or PUFA (linoleic and α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048">linolenic acids</z:chebi>) in hamsters with genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Male δ-sarcoglycan null Bio TO2 hamsters were fed a standard low-fat diet (12% energy from fat), or high-fat diets (45% fat) comprised of either saturated fat or PUFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival was increased by the high saturated fat diet (P&lt; 0.01; 278 days with standard diet and 361 days with high saturated fat)), but not with high PUFA (260 days) (n = 30-35/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body mass was modestly elevated (∼10%) in both high fat groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroups evaluated after 24 weeks had similar left ventricular chamber size, function, and mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative enzyme activity and the yield of interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) were decreased to a similar extent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TO2 groups compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> F1B hamsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore opening was enhanced in IFM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TO2 groups compared with F1B hamsters, but to a significantly greater extent in those fed the high PUFA diet compared with the standard or high saturated fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that a high intake of saturated fat improves survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> compared with a high PUFA diet or low-fat diet, despite persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> defects </plain></SENT>
