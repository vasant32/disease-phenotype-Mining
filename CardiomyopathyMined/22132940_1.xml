<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We assessed the influence of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) on clinical-echocardiographic response and outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients treated with a biventricular defibrillator (cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator [CRT-D]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 659 HF patients underwent successful implantation of CRT-D and were enrolled in a multicenter prospective registry (median follow-up of 15 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following baseline echocardiographic evaluation, patients were stratified into two groups according to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>: 232 patients with more than mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (Group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>+: grade 2, 3, and 4 MR) versus 427 patients with mild (grade 1) or no functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (Group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On 6- and 12-month echocardiographic evaluation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was seen to have improved in the vast majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>+ patients, while it remained unchanged in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On 12-month follow-up evaluation, a comparable response to CRT was observed in the two groups, in terms of the extent of left ventricular reverse remodeling and combined clinical and echocardiographic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up, event-free survival did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>+ and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>- patients, even when subpopulations of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause was the lack of Î²-blocker use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This observational analysis supports the use of CRT-D in HF patients with clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> had no major influence on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
