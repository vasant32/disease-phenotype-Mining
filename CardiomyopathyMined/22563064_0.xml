<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a profibrotic cytokine, plays a key role in this deleterious process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some beneficial effects of IGF1 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> have been described, but its potential role in improving <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> is less well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the consequences of expressing a cardiac-specific transgene encoding locally acting IGF1 propeptide (muscle-produced IGF1; mIGF1) on disease progression in a mouse model of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> [cardiac-specific and inducible serum response factor (SRF) gene disruption] that mimics some forms of human <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac-specific mIGF1 expression substantially extended the lifespan of SRF mutant mice, markedly improved cardiac functions, and delayed both <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These protective effects were accompanied by an overall improvement in cardiomyocyte architecture and a massive reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> with a concomitant amelioration of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least some of the beneficial effects of mIGF1 transgene expression were due to mIGF1 counteracting the strong increase in CTGF expression within cardiomyocytes caused by SRF deficiency, resulting in the blockade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_180'>fibroblast proliferation</z:mpath> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that SRF plays a key role in the modulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> through repression of cardiomyocyte CTGF expression in a paracrine fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also explain how impaired SRF function observed in human HF promotes <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and adverse cardiac remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Locally acting mIGF1 efficiently protects the myocardium from these adverse processes, and might thus represent a therapeutic avenue to counter <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
