<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 45 pediatric heart transplant patients (13.3%) experienced graft failure requiring retransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of them (66.7%) underwent retransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of the four died due to severe postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
