<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations within at least seven separate genes have been identified to cause ARVC, however a genetic culprit remains elusive in approximately 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although negative genetic testing may be secondary to pathogenic mutations within undiscovered genes, an alternative explanation may be the presence of large deletions or duplications involving known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These large copy number variants may not be detected with standard clinical genetic testing which is presently limited to direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe two cases of ARVC possessing large deletions involving PKP2 identified with microarray analysis and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) that would have been classified as genotype negative with standard clinical genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A deletion of the entire coding region of PKP2 excluding exon 1 was identified in patient 1 and his son </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patient 2, MLPA analysis of PKP2 revealed deletion of the entire gene with subsequent microarray analysis demonstrating a de novo 7.9 Mb deletion of chromosome 12p12.1p11.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support screening for large copy number variants in clinically suspected ARVC cases without clear disease causing mutations following initial sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
