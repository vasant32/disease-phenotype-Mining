<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been limited by small sized biopsies and complicated by high variances between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a high demand for suitable model systems with the capability to simulate ischemic and cardiotoxic effects in vitro, under defined conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, we established an in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> model based on the contractile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify pathways involved in the cellular alterations induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and thereby defining disease-specific biomarkers and potential target structures for new drug candidates we used fluorescence 2D-difference gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing spot density changes in ischemic and reperfusion samples we detected several protein spots that were differentially abundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and ESI-MS the proteins were identified and subsequently grouped by functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most prominent were changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> signalling, cell structure and energy-metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations were confirmed by analysis of human biopsies from patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>.With the establishment of our in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury target identification via proteomic research becomes independent from rare human material and will create new possibilities in cardiac research </plain></SENT>
