<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were interested in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease models</z:e> using a patient-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes because of their similarity to a patient's tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as these studies have just begun, we would like to review the literature in this and other related fields and discuss the path for future models of molecular biology that can help to diagnose and cure diseases, and its involvement in regenerative medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of iPS cells and/or differentiated cardiomyocytes has been recognized as a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> model should be evaluated using molecular biological analyses, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression profiles and proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
