<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our patient, a 5-year-old boy on a ketogenic diet for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level before starting the diet, but he shortly thereafter developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, which was unmasked during a hospitalization for an elective operative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was suspected to be secondary to a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-deficient state and was confirmed by way of a markedly low serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level and supported by rapid improvement with the initiation of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> supplementation and cessation of the ketogenic diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients being initiated on a ketogenic diet, current screening guidelines call for baseline and follow-up <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels every 3 months during the first year along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RDA</z:e> <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> supplementation, which is 30 mcg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the new ketogenic diet formulas meet this requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patient underwent elective surgery before his planned 3-month <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level check and had potentially preventable complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary to this experience, we suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients initiated on a ketogenic diet should have a preoperative electrocardiogram (EKG), an echocardiogram, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level determined before any elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These steps would prevent unnecessary perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
