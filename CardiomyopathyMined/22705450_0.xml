<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> has been recognized for long throughout history and is unquestionably the leading cause of unintentional poisoning <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of poisoning is dependent upon environmental and human factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leading pathophysiological mechanism resides in the ability of <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> to bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> molecules with high affinity, displacing oxygen and generating carboxyhemoglobin, which is virtually ineffective to deliver oxygen to the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The organs with the highest demand for oxygen such as the brain and the heart are more vulnerable to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial involvement is commonplace in moderate to severe <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> poisoning and is associated with a substantially higher risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides hypoxic damage, <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> produces myocardium injuries with cardiospecific mechanisms, mostly attributable to direct damage at cellular or subcellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of heart involvement is broad and encompasses <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> attack, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> up to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e>, cardiogenic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, are at greater risk of infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the technique of choice for diagnosing cardiac involvement, whereas the recent introduction of the highly sensitive troponin immunoassays seems promising for the early triage of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No specific treatment other than oxygen delivery can be advocated for cardiac toxicity at present, and 100% oxygen therapy should be continued until the patient is asymptomatic and carboxyhemoglobin levels decrease below 5-10% </plain></SENT>
