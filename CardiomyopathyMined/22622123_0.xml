<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sex-related differences have been identified not only in the prevalence of the phenomenon, but also in risk factors and etiology of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peripartum period represents a peculiar trigger of SCD in women with underlying cardiovascular substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several lesions, both congenital and acquired, may be identified at postmortem in SCD victims, including coronary artery, myocardial, valve, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the incidence of SCD increases progressively with age in adult elderly women to reach a 1:1 male:female ratio after the age of 80 years, mostly due to the increasing incidence of atherosclerotic disease in the postmenopausal period, SCD in young women is a rare event and usually associated with non-atherosclerotic disease, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, spontaneous coronary dissection, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
