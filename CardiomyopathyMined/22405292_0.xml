<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help to clarify the uncertainties related to this genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that many articles have been published concerning the use of MRI in the study of LVNC, there is a lack of data describing the disease in the North African population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to clarify MRI findings of LVNC in North African patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our retrospective cohort, twelve patients (7 male, mean age 53 Â± 8 years) underwent MRI for suspected LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations were investigated between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), then between the number of non-compacted segments and left ventricular end diastolic diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) was qualitatively determined for each left ventricular myocardial segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-compaction was more commonly observed at the apex, the anterior and the lateral walls, especially on their apical and mid-cavity segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>83% of patients had impaired LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and LVEF (r = -0.361; p = 0.263), nor between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (r = 0.280; p = 0.377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LGE was observed in 22 left ventricular segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and non-compaction distribution (OR = 2.2, CI [0.91-5.55], p = 0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distribution of LVNC in North African patients does not differ from other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ventricular dysfunction is independent from the number of non-compacted segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is not limited to non-compacted areas but can extend to compacted segments </plain></SENT>
