<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a method using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the mechanobiological properties of pluripotent, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, including contraction force, rate, duration, and cellular elasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured beats from cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy subjects and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and from embryonic stem cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that our AFM method could quantitate beat forces of single cells and clusters of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the dose-responsive, inotropic effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and beta-adrenergic blockade of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes derived from subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> showed decreased force and decreased cellular elasticity compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This AFM-based method can serve as a screening tool for the development of cardiac-active pharmacological agents, or as a platform for studying cardiomyocyte biology </plain></SENT>
