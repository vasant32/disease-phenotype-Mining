<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the pathophysiologic basis of the Wellens' ECG pattern in TTC by characterization of underlying myocardial changes using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 20 consecutive patients with TTC (95% females,mean age 65.3±10.4 years) who underwent CMR studies both in the initial phase and after 3-months of follow-up, using a protocol which included cine images, T2-weighted sequences for myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and post-contrast sequences for late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative ECG indexes of repolarization, such as maximal amplitude of negative T-waves (NTWm), sum of the amplitudes of negative T waves (NTWs) and maximum QT interval (QTc max), were correlated to CMR findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of initial CMR study, there was a significant linear correlation between apico-basal ratio of T2 signal intensity (SI) for myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and NTWm (ρ=0.498;p=0.02), NTWs (ρ=0.483;p=0.03) and QTc max (ρ=0.520;p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repolarization indexes were unrelated to either LGE or quantitative cine parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wellens' <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> showed a parallel time course of development and resolution on initial and follow-up CMR studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study results show that the ischemic-like Wellens' ECG pattern in TTC coincides and quantitatively correlates with the apico-basal gradient of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> as evidenced by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dynamic negative T-waves and QTc prolongation are likely to reflect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-induced transient inhomogeneity and dispersion of repolarization between apical and basal LV regions </plain></SENT>
