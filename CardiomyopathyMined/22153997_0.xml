<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myocardial injury may also occur during heat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, resulting in cardiac enzyme increase and ST-segment changes on the ECG </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A previous case report described a patient with heat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ST-segment elevation, in which the definite cause of the ST-segment elevation was unclear; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was ruled out according to the clinical signs, serial ECG changes, and serum level of cardiac biomarkers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We herein report a case of heat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presenting with ST-segment elevation and cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventriculography showed midventricular and apical hypokinesis, and stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was then determined to be the appropriate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
