<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature on pre-pubertal children at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to assess the endothelial function of pre-pubertal children at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched the published literature indexed in PubMed, Bireme and SciELO using the keywords 'endothelial', 'children', 'pediatric' and 'infant' and then compiled a systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end points were age, the pubertal stage, sex differences, the method used for the endothelial evaluation and the endothelial values themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No studies on children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 11 papers were selected for our complete analysis, where these included reports on the flow-mediated percentage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, the values of which were 9.80±1.80, 5.90±1.29, 4.50±0.70, and 7.10±1.27 for healthy, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, diabetic and pre-pubertal children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki's disease</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, independent of the endothelium, either among the groups or between the genders for both of the measurements in children; similar results have been found in adolescents and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endothelial function in cardiomyopathic children remains unclear because of the lack of data; nevertheless, the known dysfunctions in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki's disease</z:e> may influence the severity of the cardiovascular symptoms, the prognosis, and the mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study encourage future research into the consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in pre-pubertal children </plain></SENT>
