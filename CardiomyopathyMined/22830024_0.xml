<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the state of the genetic knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of the causing mutation is important since presymptomatic interventions of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> have proven value in preventing morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, as in general in genetic studies, the identification of the mutated genes has a direct clinical impact for the families and population involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identifying causative mutations immediately amplifies the possibilities for disease prevention through carrier screening and prenatal testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This often lifts a burden of social isolation from affected families, since healthy family members can be assured of having healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identification of the mutated genes holds the potential to lead to the understanding of disease etiology, pathophysiology, and therefore potential therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the genetic variations, or disease-causing mutations, contributing to the pathogenesis of hereditary <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and tries to relate these to the functions of the mutated genes </plain></SENT>
