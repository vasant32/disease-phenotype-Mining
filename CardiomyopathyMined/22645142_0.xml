<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) varies from cardiac recovery to end stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of this variability is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the impact of coding polymorphisms of the innate immune protein Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on left ventricular performance in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two variants of TLR4 (rs4986790, TLR4 c.1187A→G, p.299D→G and rs4986791,TLR4 c.1487C→T, p.T399I) were investigated in 158 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other reasons for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were excluded by coronary angiography, myocardial biopsy, and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, age, gender, or treatment did not differ among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the follow-up evaluation (median 4.0-5.4 months), patients carrying the TLR4 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> gene displayed cardiac recovery under intense medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapy indexed by reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp>, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced NT-probrain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> blood level when compared with the initial evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients carrying both the rs4986790 and the rs4986791 variant showed significantly reduced improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.006) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp> (p = 0.015) at the follow-up evaluation when compared with carriers of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> gene under the same treatment conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, NT-probrain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level in carriers of both TLR4 variants did not change significantly at the follow up when compared with the first evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, the presence of the TLR4 variants rs4986790 and rs4986791 predicts impaired cardiac recovery independently of medical treatment or cardiac risk factors </plain></SENT>
