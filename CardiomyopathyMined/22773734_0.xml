<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously interrogated the transcriptome in heart tissue from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice, a mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutation, and found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Jun N-terminal kinase branches of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway were abnormally hyperactivated prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of significant cardiac impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now used an alternative gene expression analysis tool to reanalyze this transcriptome and identify hyperactivation of a third branch of the MAP kinase cascade, p38α signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of hearts from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice showed enhanced p38α activation prior to and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> as well as in hearts from human subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice with the p38α inhibitor ARRY-371797 prevented left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and deterioration of fractional shortening compared with placebo-treated mice but did not block the expression of collagen genes involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that three different branches of the MAP kinase signaling pathway with overlapping consequences are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They further suggest that pharmacological inhibition of p38α may be useful in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
