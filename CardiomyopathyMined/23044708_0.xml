<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to describe the main characteristics of a larger patient cohort and their long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS.: Retrospective study on EGPA patients entered into the FVSG database and satisfying the American College of Rheumatology and/or Chapel Hill criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> status and year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: We identified 383 patients diagnosed between 1957 and June 2009 (128 [33.4%] diagnosed ≤1996) and followed for 66.8 ± 62.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, mean age was 50.3 ± 15.7 years and 91.1% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> (since 9.3 ± 10.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (51.4%), ENT signs (48.0%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (39.7%), lung infiltrates (38.6%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (16.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 348 whose sera were tested at diagnosis for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, the 108 (31.0%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>+ patients had significantly more frequent ENT manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and/or renal involvement, but less frequent cardiac manifestations than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> relapses occurred in 35.2% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>+ versus 22.5% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>- patients (P = 0.01) and 5.6% versus 12.5%, respectively, died (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year relapse-free survival was 58.1% [95% CI; 45.6-68.6] for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>+ and 67.8% [95% CI; 59.8-74.5] for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>- patients (P = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, older age and diagnosis ≤1996 as independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and lower eosinophil count at diagnosis as predictive of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION.: EGPA patients differ according to their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> status, as do their long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although EGPA relapses remain frequent, mortality has declined, at least since 1996. © 2012 American College of Rheumatology </plain></SENT>
