<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess whether contractile reserve during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) can predict left ventricular functional recovery in patients with peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent DSE and were followed for six months, when a rest Doppler echocardiogram was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was also performed at the beginning of follow-up to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 29±7.9 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 39.4±8.6% (range 24-49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the nine patients showed left ventricular functional recovery with mean ejection fraction at follow-up of 57.1±13.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ejection fraction response to DSE did not predict recovery at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline correlated with ejection fraction at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was detected in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was a predictor of left ventricular functional recovery in patients with peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dobutamine stress echocardiography at presentation of the disease did not predict recovery at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> appeared to be uncommon in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
