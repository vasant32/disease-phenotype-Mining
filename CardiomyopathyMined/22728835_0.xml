<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) show a limited exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A correlation between exercise tolerance and diastolic dysfunction has already been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the role of rest-induced or exercise-induced obstruction as a determinant of exercise capacity is still open to debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyse the exertional behaviour of patients with HCM presenting different left ventricle (LV) obstructive profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with HCM (mean age 45 ± 14 years, 23 men) underwent echocardiography during cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive measurement of cardiac output was obtained with an inert gas rebreathing system at the beginning and at peak of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (43%) had neither resting nor provocable obstruction (group A: non-obstructive profile), 12 patients (34%) showed provocable obstruction during exercise (group B: latent-obstructive profile) and eight patients (23%) presented obstruction at rest (group C: rest-obstructive profile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A and B patients showed higher peak oxygen consumption in comparison with group C patients (24 ± 6 and 23 ± 6 vs. 17 ± 3 ml/kg per min; P = 0.016) and a greater increment of cardiac index during exercise (6.6 ± 1.3 and 6.0 ± 1.4 vs. 4.6 ± 0.8 l/min per m; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In comparison with the rest-obstructive profile, latent and non-obstructive HCM patients seem to share a similar exertional behaviour characterized by a greater increment of cardiac index during exercise and a minor impairment of exercise tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in HCM patients not obstructive at rest, latent obstruction cannot be suspected based on exertional behaviour and functional capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography performed during CPX test providing an important adjunct, may be valuable in guiding treatment in patients with substantial exercise limitation </plain></SENT>
