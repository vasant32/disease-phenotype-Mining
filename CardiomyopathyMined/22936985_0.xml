<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathways inducing the critical transition from compensated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> to cardiac dilation and failure remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study is to determine the role of Rac-induced signaling in this transition process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous results showed that Thyroxin (T4) treatment resulted in increased myocardial Rac expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and a higher level of expression in Zea maize RacD (ZmRacD) transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our current results showed that T4 treatment induced physiologic <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, as demonstrated by echocardiography and histopathology analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with significant increases in myocardial Rac-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and ERK1/2 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, echocardiography and histopathology analyses showed that T4 treatment induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> along with compensatory <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> in ZmRacD mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were linked with further increases in myocardial Rac-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and ERK1/2 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there were significant increases in caspase-8 expression and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant decrease in p38-MAPK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, inhibition of myocardial Rac-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> activity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation with pravastatin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, respectively, attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> functional, structural, and molecular changes associated with the T4-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in ZmRacD mice except the compensatory <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, T4-induced ZmRacD is a novel mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that shares many characteristics with the human disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study to show graded Rac-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>·(-) results in cardiac phenotype shift in-vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Rac-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>·(-) generation, cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> seem to play a pivotal role in the transition from <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> to cardiac dilation and failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Targeting Rac signaling could represent valuable therapeutic strategy not only in saving the failing myocardium but also to prevent this transition process </plain></SENT>
