<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery occurs spontaneously with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e>, while it generally follows revascularization in case of hibernating myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography is an accurate modality for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e> and provides important information on ventricular remodelling after both systemic thrombolysis and primary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with conservatively treated infarction, the prognostic significance of viability by dobutamine stress echocardiography correlates with residual pump function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substantial contractile reserve is predictive of favourable outcome in patients with poor but not in those with preserved or slightly reduced left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive assessment of coronary flow reserve with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography of the left anterior descending coronary artery allows to distinguish between necrotic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e> and predicts ventricular remodelling following primary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting echocardiographic examination can provide information on hibernating myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, systolic thickening &lt;7 mm, restrictive filling pattern, and high end-systolic volume are predictive of no viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with nuclear imaging, dobutamine stress echocardiography is more specific for predicting functional recovery, less expensive, more generally available and radiation-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence collected over the years demonstrates the favourable prognostic impact of revascularizing extensive myocardial territories which are found viable at dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognostic implications of viability-guided revascularization have been clearly established in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of myocardial viability has been questioned by the results of the STICH trial that did not demonstrate any advantage of survival in the patients with a large extent of myocardial viability undergoing revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="?"><plain>Is the end of a paradigm that deeply influenced clinical practice so far or just a neutral result that can be ignored due to the several limitations of study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the present review, we will address the main advantages and limitations of ultrasounds for the evaluation of myocardial viability and try to demonstrate that viability is still viable </plain></SENT>
