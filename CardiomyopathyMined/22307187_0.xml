<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> is the major life-threatening complication with the use of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the very small time window before administering thrombolytics, it is often not possible to investigate the unusual causes of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that occurs most often in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present the decision and risk of thrombolysis for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE: A case of a teenager with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who received thrombolysis and had resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>; however, in children, one must consider and exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mimickers and recognize that potentially life-threatening <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complicates the use of these medications </plain></SENT>
