<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Identification of new molecular targets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> could ultimately have a substantial positive impact on both the health and financial aspects of treating the large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We originally identified reduced levels of the cell junction protein claudin-5 specifically in heart in the dystrophin/utrophin-deficient (Dmd(mdx);Utrn(-/-)) mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which demonstrates physiological hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then showed that at least 60% of cardiac explant samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> resulting from diverse etiologies also have reduced claudin-5 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These claudin-5 reductions were independent of changes in other cell junction proteins previously linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether sustaining claudin-5 levels is sufficient to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of histological and functional indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show the proof-of-concept rescue experiment in the Dmd(mdx);Utrn(-/-) model, in which claudin-5 reductions were originally identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of claudin-5 4 weeks after a single administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) containing a claudin-5 expression cassette prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of physiological hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and improved histological signs of cardiac damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This experiment demonstrates that claudin-5 may represent a novel treatment target for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
