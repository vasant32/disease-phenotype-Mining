<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> causes cardiac injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measuring biomarkers during therapy might help individualize treatment by immediately identifying cardiac injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> alone (n = 100; 75 analyzed) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> (n = 105; 81 analyzed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms and serial serum measurements of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; cardiac injury biomarker), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> biomarker), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; inflammatory biomarker) were obtained before, during, and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cTnT levels were increased in 12% of children in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> group and in 13% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> group before treatment but in 47% and 13%, respectively, after treatment (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were increased in 89% of children in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> group and in 92% of children in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> group before treatment but in only 48% and 20%, respectively, after treatment (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of children with increased hsCRP levels did not differ between groups at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first 90 days of treatment, detectable increases in cTnT were associated with abnormally reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness 4 years later (P &lt; .01); increases in NT-proBNP were related to an <z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>abnormal LV</z:mp> thickness-to-dimension ratio, suggesting LV remodeling, 4 years later (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in hsCRP were not associated with any echocardiographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: cTnT and NT-proBNP may hold promise as biomarkers of cardiotoxicity in children with high-risk ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Definitive validation studies are required to fully establish their range of clinical utility </plain></SENT>
