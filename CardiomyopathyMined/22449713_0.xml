<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX) is an effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> agent used for the treatment of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, its use is limited as this drug induces cardiotoxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> as a side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no report which describes whether transplanted embryonic stem (ES)cells or their conditioned medium (CM) in DOX induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) can repair and regenerate myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we transplanted ES cells or CM in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> to examine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, cytoplasmic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss and their associated Akt and ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we also determined activation of endogenous c-kit+(ve) cardiac stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>), levels of HGF and IGF-1, growth factors required for c-kit cell activation, and their differentiation into cardiac myocytes, which also contributes in cardiac regeneration and improved heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We generated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> in C57Bl/6 mice (cumulative dose of DOX 12mg/kg body weight, i.p), and animals were treated with ES cells, CM or cell culture medium in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, ES cells or CM transplanted hearts showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in cardiac apoptotic nuclei and their regulation with Akt and ERK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>Cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> observed in the ES cell or CM groups was significantly less compared with DOX and cell culture medium groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, cytoplasmic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss was reduced (p&lt;0.05) following treatment with ES cells or CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data also demonstrated increased levels of c-kit+ve <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> in ES cells or CM hearts and differentiated cardiac myocytes from these <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>, suggesting endogenous cardiac regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the levels of HFG and IGF-1 were significantly increased in ES cells or CM transplanted hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we reported that transplanted ES cells or CM in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> hearts significantly decreases various adverse pathological mechanisms as well as enhances cardiac regeneration that effectively contributes to improved heart function </plain></SENT>
