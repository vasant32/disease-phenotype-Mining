<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering from septic shock often present with not only severe reduction of afterload induced by vasodilation but are also affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>-induced cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated troponin levels, which are typically not caused by coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, may indicate septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> which is characterized both by altered systolic function as well as by disturbances in the regulation of heart rate and heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter findings are based not only on the dysfunction of the autonomous <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system but are also the result of the direct interaction of endotoxins with cardiac pacemaker cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to quantify the extent of septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, cardiac output has to be considered in the light of the existing afterload, i.e., by the parameter 'afterload-related cardiac performance' (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy of septic shock (and thereby septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) is based on the well-known causative, supportive, and adjunctive strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stabilization of cardiac function is assured by volume resuscitation (including blood transfusion) and inotropic support (dobutamine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further specific therapeutic approaches have not yet been established </plain></SENT>
