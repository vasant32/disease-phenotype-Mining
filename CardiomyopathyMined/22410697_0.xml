<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to improve cardiac performance, the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system increases sympathetic tone primarily through release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> from postganglionic receptors to stimulate the Î²-adrenergic receptors of the nodal and muscle tissue of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This event initiates a signaling cascade focused on increasing the amount of calcium available to the contractile myofilaments in the cardiac cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Failure of the myocytes to counterbalance the increase in inward ion flow or adequately sequester cytosolic calcium during diastole leads to potentially catastrophic electrical instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review, the relationship between the cellular events initiated by exercise and the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> associated with the long QT, Brugada, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndromes</z:hpo>; catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>; and the heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> are explored </plain></SENT>
