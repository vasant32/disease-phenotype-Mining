<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two brothers, 3 and 4 years of age and diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALMS</z:e>, who initially presented in infancy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> during febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease course in the two siblings was marked by significant intrafamilial variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the older sibling has mainly resolved thus allowing for the discontinuation of medical therapy, heart function in the younger sibling continues to deteriorate despite maximal drug support with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>, and aldospirone </plain></SENT>
