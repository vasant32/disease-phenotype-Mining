<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients with QRS ≥120 ms and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤35% were prospectively followed after CRT in the Mayo CRT Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LV discoordination index (stretch/shortening or thinning/thickening during ejection) was calculated from three types of deformation, radial, circumferential, and longitudinal, using two-dimensional speckle tracking strain rate imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benefit of CRT was evaluated by reverse remodelling (i.e. reduction of LV end-systolic volume ≥15% at 6-month follow-up) and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal cut-off value of the baseline discoordination index in discriminating responders from non-responders was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in baseline indices between responders and non-responders were noted for radial and circumferential discoordination indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mid-ventricular radial discoordination index (RDI-M) &gt;38% best predicted responders, especially in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (area under the curve 0.86 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, sensitivity 80%, and specificity 91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 28 patients over a median follow-up of 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for confounding variables, lack of significant discoordination (RDI-M &lt;38%) before CRT was associated with a particularly high mortality (hazard ratio 7.05, 95% confidence interval 2.45-26.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LV discoordination assessed by speckle tracking RDI-M imaging was able to predict reverse remodelling at 6 months and survival of patients who received CRT </plain></SENT>
