<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Multiple published studies have established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> (ED) as an independent risk marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, incident ED has a similar or greater predictive value for cardiovascular events than traditional risk factors including smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we review evidence that supports ED as a particularly significant harbinger of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in 2 populations: men &lt;60 years of age and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although addition of ED to the Framingham Risk Score only modestly improved the 10-year predictive capacity of the Framingham Risk Score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> data in men enrolled in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, other epidemiologic studies suggest that the predictive value of ED is quite strong in younger men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in the Olmstead County Study, men 40 to 49 years of age with ED had a 50-fold higher incidence of new-incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> than those without ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, ED had less predictive value (5-fold increased risk) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in men 70 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several studies, including a large analysis of more than 6300 men enrolled in the ADVANCE study, suggest that ED is a particularly powerful predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in diabetic men as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the literature reviewed here, we encourage physicians to inquire about ED symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men more than 30 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of ED, particularly in men &lt;60 years old and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, represents an important first step toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk detection and reduction </plain></SENT>
