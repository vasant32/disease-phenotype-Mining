<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present analysis was to determine whether, based on baseline left ventricular (LV) function parameters, any subgroups could be identified that benefited from SVR.Methods and resultsAmong the 1000 patients enrolled, Core Lab measures of baseline LV function with adequate quality were obtained in 710 patients using echocardiography, in 352 using cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and in 344 using radionuclide imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between LV end-systolic volume index (ESVI), end-diastolic volume index, ejection fraction (EF), regional wall motion abnormalities, and outcome were first assessed only by echocardiographic measures, and then by 13 algorithms using a different hierarchy of imaging modalities and their quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median ESVI and EF were 78.0 (range: 22.8-283.8) mL/m(2) and 28.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios comparing the randomized arms by subgroups of LVESVI and LVEF measured by echocardiography found that patients with smaller ventricles (LVESVI &lt;60 mL/m(2)) and better LVEF (≥33%) may have benefitted by SVR, while those with larger ventricles (LVESVI &gt;90 mL/m(2)) and lower LVEF (≤25%) did worse with SVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Algorithms using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three imaging modalities found a weaker relationship between LV global function and the effects of SVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of regional wall motion abnormality did not influence the effects of SVR.ConclusionsSubgroup analyses of the STICH trial suggest that patients with less dilated LV and better LVEF may benefit from SVR, while those with larger LV and poorer LVEF may do worse.Clinical Trial Registration #: NCT00023595 </plain></SENT>
