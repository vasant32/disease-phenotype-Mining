<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Drosophila is a useful model organism in which the genetics of human diseases, including recent advances in identification of the genetics of heart development and disease in the fly, can be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify novel genes that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, we performed a deficiency screen in adult Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using optical coherence tomography to phenotype cardiac function in awake adult Drosophila, we identified Df(1)Exel6240 as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a number of strategies including customized smaller deletions, screening of mutant alleles, and transgenic rescue, we identified CG3226 as the causative gene for this deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CG3226 is an uncharacterized gene in Drosophila possessing homology to the mammalian Siah-interacting protein (SIP) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mammalian SIP functions as an adaptor protein involved in one of the β-catenin degradation complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of altering β-catenin/Armadillo signaling in the adult fly, we measured heart function in flies expressing either constitutively active Armadillo or transgenic constructs that block Armadillo signaling, specifically in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While, increasing Armadillo signaling in the heart did not have an effect on adult heart function, decreasing Armadillo signaling in the fly heart caused the significant reduction in heart chamber size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we show that deletion of CG3226, which has homology to mammalian SIP, causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in adult Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alterations in Armadillo signaling during development lead to important changes in the size and function of the adult heart </plain></SENT>
