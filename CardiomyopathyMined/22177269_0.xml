<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study material for the genetic screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> consisted of 41 cases and was selected from the case database at the Institute of Forensic Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutational screening by DNA sequencing was performed to detect mutations in DNA samples from deceased persons suspected of suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and arrhythmogenic right ventricle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 9 of the examined 41 cases had a rare sequence variant in the MYBPC3, MYH7, LMNA, PKP2 or TMEM43 genes, of which 4 cases (9.8%) were presumed to be pathogenic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presumed pathogenic mutations were distributed with one case of suspected HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (MYH7; p.R442H), one case of suspected <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (LMNA; p.R471H), and two cases of suspected ARVC (PKP2; p.R79X and LMNA; p.R644C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presented data adds important information on the genetic elements of SCD in the young, and calls for expert pathological evaluation and molecular autopsy in the post-mortem examination of SCD victims with structural anomalies of the heart </plain></SENT>
