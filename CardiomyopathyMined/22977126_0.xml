<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -Myocardial strain imaging using echocardiography can be a cost-effective method to objectively quantify ventricular wall motion but few studies have compared strain measured with echocardiography against MRI in small animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -We compared circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) measured with echocardiography (vector velocity imaging [VVI]) to displacement encoding with stimulated-echo (DENSE) MRI in two mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 month old mice with gene targeted deficiency of cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C(-/-), n=6) or muscle LIM protein (MLP(-/-), n=6), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice (n=8), myocardial strains were measured at three cross-sectional levels and averaged to obtain global strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was modest correlation between VVI and MRI measured strains, with global CS yielding stronger correlation compared to global RS (CS R(2) = 0.4452 vs. RS R(2) = 0.2794, both p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, strain measured by VVI was more variable than MRI (p&lt;0.05) and the limits of agreement were slightly, but not significantly (p=0.14) closer for global CS than RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both VVI and MRI strain measurements showed significantly lower global CS strain in the knockout groups compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VVI (but not MRI) CS strain measurements were different between the two knockout groups (-14.5 ± 3.8% vs. -6.6 ± 4.0%, cMyBP-C(-/-) vs. MLP(-/-) respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Measurements of LV circumferential and radial strains are feasible in small animals using 2D echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VVI and MRI strain measurements correlated modestly and the agreement between the modalities tended to be greater for circumferential than radial strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although VVI and MRI strains were able to differentiate between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and knockout mice, only global circumferential VVI strain differentiated between the two models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
