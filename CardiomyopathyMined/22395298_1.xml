<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LTx) is an accepted treatment for hereditary transthyretin (TTR) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (ATTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, unforeseen heart complications, especially a rapid development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after LTx has affected mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a relationship between ATTR-fibril composition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in LTx ATTR amyloid patients is related to amyloid fibril composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with hereditary ATTR <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> who had undergone LTx and have had their amyloid fibril type tested were available for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had been examined by echocardiography including tissue Doppler and speckle tracking echocardiography before and after LTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to fibril composition, 10 patients with type A fibrils (a mixture of truncated and full-length TTR) and 14 patients with type B fibrils (full-length TTR fibrils only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in time to the follow-up echocardiography between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After LTx, the group consisting of type A patients developed symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and with reduced systolic and diastolic ventricular function as shown by echocardiography, whereas no similar deterioration was noted for the group of patients with type B fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with type A fibrils deteriorate an already existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> after LTx, in contrast to patients with type B fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results might have significant clinical implications in optimizing best patients selection criteria for LTx </plain></SENT>
