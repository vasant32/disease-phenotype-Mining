<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that treatment in a specialized, comprehensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> program results in similar survival between African Americans and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed patient data implanted with HeartMate II (HM-II) LVAD over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 79 patients: 34 (43%) whites, 33 (42%) African Americans, and 12 (15%) patients belonging to other ethnicities there was no difference in demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was more commonly ischemic in white patients compared to nonischemic in African American patients (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 22.21 ± 10.66% in African American patients and 15.21 ± 5.54% in white patients (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular end-diastolic (p = 0.06) and end-systolic (p = 0.03) diameters were greater in white patients compared to African American patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was seen in 79% of African American patients compared to 56% in white patients (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an unadjusted survival advantage in African American patients (p = 0.04 by log-rank test), but this survival advantage was lost in multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment for other covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in readmissions (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> undergoing HM-II LVAD implantation, African American patients had a similar survival and no difference in readmissions when compared with white patients despite significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
