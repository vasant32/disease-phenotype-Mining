<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first Danish paediatric heart transplantation (HTx) was performed at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen in 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our experiences during the first 20 years with paediatric HTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 37 paediatric patients (&lt;18 years) who were listed for HTx from 1991 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26 of the 37 children listed underwent HTx, nine due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) and 17 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients died while being on the waiting list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient was withdrawn from the list due to spontaneous improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 patients remain alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was 92% after five years and 82% after ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We had two early (CHD) and three late (CM) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications were few, but significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection occurred in seven patients, whereas one patient with repeated late episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection died from graft failure 5.5 years after HTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found a time-related progressive deterioration in renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent renal Tx, two others died while being on dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy occurred in three patients, two of whom died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The third remains alive today, 19 years after HTx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our paediatric HTx results are comparable with those of larger international centres and consistent with true long-term survival </plain></SENT>
