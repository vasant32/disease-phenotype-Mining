<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> on left ventricular (LV) function and coronary microvascular integrity in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> patients were divided into 2 groups: elevated (&gt; 7 mg/dL for men and &gt;6.5 mg/dL for women; n = 24) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 15) UA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> 300 mg per day was given to the elevated UA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with elevated UA were assessed after a 3-month treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography assessing coronary flow reserve (CFR) and systolic and diastolic LV functions were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LV ejection fraction was significantly lower in elevated UA group: mean (interquartile range), 32.3% (26.0-36.5%) vs 37.3% (35.5-39.1%) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, CFR and LV diastolic and combined function parameters were more prominently impaired in the elevated UA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> treatment, UA was significantly decreased (7.2 mg/dL [6.8-7.8] to 4.4 mg/dL [3.9-5.8]; P &lt; 0.001) and CFR was markedly improved (1.87 [1.63-2.00] to 2.20 [1.87-2.49]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> on the reduction of UA from baseline was directly related to the improvement of CFR (r = 0.49; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mitral A and E/E' were reduced, while S', E', E/A, and E'/A' were increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that 3-month treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> was significantly associated with reduced UA levels, and improvement of CFR and LV functions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
