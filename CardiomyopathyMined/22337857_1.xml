<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human exome sequencing is a recently developed tool to aid in the discovery of novel coding variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now broadly applied, exome sequencing data sets provide a novel opportunity to evaluate the allele frequencies of previously published pathogenic rare variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the exome data set from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project and compared this data set with a catalog of 197 previously published rare variants reported as causative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) from familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 197, 33 (16.8%) were also present in the Exome Sequencing Project database, raising the question of whether they were uncommon polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supporting functional data has been published for 14 of the 33 (42%), suggesting they are unlikely to be false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of these functional variants in the Exome Sequencing Project data set ranged from 0.02 to 1.33% (median 0.04%), which when applied as a cutoff to filter variants in a <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> pedigree identified an additional <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> candidate gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> cases had variants that were present in the Exome Sequencing Project data set versus novel variants (ie, not in the Exome Sequencing Project; 44% versus 21%; P=0.002), suggesting some of the variants identified as disease causing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> are either false-positives or low penetrance alleles in human populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rare nonsynonymous variants identified in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> subjects also present at very low frequencies in public databases are likely relevant for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies &gt;0.04% are of less certain pathogenicity, especially if identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, although this cutoff should be viewed as preliminary </plain></SENT>
