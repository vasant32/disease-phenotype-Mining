<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), the sequence of decrease in multidirectional myocardial deformation has not been clearly elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated the sequence of myocardial deformations in rat <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (1.25 mg/kg × 16 times, intraperitoneal) for 4 weeks and compared with nine control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial strain analysis with 2DSTE, as well as conventional echocardiography, was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with baseline, longitudinal strain/strain rate (LS/LSr) decreased at week 2 (-15.7 ± 1.5 to -14.1 ± 1.4%, P = 0.01 for LS; -4.4 ± 0.7 to -3.9 ± 0.5 per second, P = 0.009 for LSr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and circumferential strain (CS) decreased at week 4 (80.3 ± 3.2 to 78.1 ± 3.3%, P = 0.031 for LVEF; -18.6 ± 1.9 to -15.0 ± 3.4%, P = 0.019 for CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circumferential strain rate (CSr) decreased at week 6 (-5.5 ± 0.8 to -4.6 ± 1.0 per second, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radial strain/strain rate (RS/RSr) decreased at week 8 (54.8 ± 9.4 to 43.7 ± 10.6%, P = 0.005 for RS; 8.0 ± 1.1 to 7.0 ± 1.1 per second, P = 0.005 for RSr), while there was no significant change in LS/LSr, LVEF, CS/CSr, or RS/RSr in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVEF had the highest correlation with LS (r =-0.607, P = 0.000) and the lowest correlation with RSr (r = 0.357, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> of rat hearts, LS/LSr decreased first, and then LVEF, CS, CSr, RS/RSr subsequently decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LS/LSr is considered to be a more sensitive predictor than LVEF in progressive rat <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, and RS/RSr was preserved until the last stage </plain></SENT>
