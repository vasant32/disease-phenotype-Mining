<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deposited amyloid fibers share a common nonbranched <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, the affected end organs, clinical presentation, treatment strategies, and prognosis vary greatly among this group of diseases and are largely dependent on the specific amyloid precursor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, at least 27 precursor proteins have been identified to result in either local tissue or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, with nine of them manifesting in cardiac deposition and resulting in a syndrome termed "cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>" or "amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>." Although cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> has been traditionally considered to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e>, as clinical appreciation and understanding continues to grow, so too has the prevalence, suggesting that this disease may be greatly underdiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common form of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is associated with circulating amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other major cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002726" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amyloidoses</z:e> result from a misfolding of products of mutated or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> transthyretin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the various cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002726" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amyloidoses</z:e> share a common functional consequence, namely, an infiltrative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with restrictive pathophysiology leading to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, the underlying pathophysiology and clinical syndrome varies with each precursor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, we aim to provide an up-to-date overview of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> from nomenclature to molecular mechanisms and treatment options, with a particular focus on amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain protein cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
