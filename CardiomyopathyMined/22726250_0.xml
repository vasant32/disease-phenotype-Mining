<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The available evidence measuring LV rotation in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> has not been systematically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To review systematically the evidence measuring LV rotational changes in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> compared to healthy controls, literature searches were conducted for appropriate articles using several electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized-controlled trials, prospective cohort and case-controlled studies that assessed LV rotation in relation to various heart conditions were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three independent reviewers evaluated each investigation's quality using validated scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were tabulated and levels of evidence assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,782 studies were found through the systematic literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon review of the articles, 47 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The articles were separated into those investigating changes in LV rotation in participants with: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, non-compaction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002563'>constrictive pericarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, diastolic dysfunction, heart transplant, implanted pacemaker, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidence showing changes in LV rotation due to various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was supported by evidence with limited to moderate methodological quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively low quality and volume of evidence, the literature consistently shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> leads to marked changes in LV rotation, while rotational systolic-diastolic coupling is preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No prognostic information exists on the potential value of rotational measures of LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that measures of LV rotation may aid in diagnosing subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
