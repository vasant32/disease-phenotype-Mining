<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: We aimed to analyze the feasibility of two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) in evaluating myocardial strain in consecutive, nonselected patients in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Strain analysis using 2DSTE was attempted in 59 consecutive patients: 24 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 7 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis was done by four expert echocardiographers and one cardiology resident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: It was possible to obtain reliable data for radial strain in 175 of 354 segments (49%), circumferential strain in 192 of 354 segments (54%), and longitudinal strain in 319 of 354 segments (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experienced echocardiographers felt assessment of radial and circumferential strain was appropriate in more segments than did the cardiology resident (57% and 58% vs. 23% and 40%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Longitudinal strain analysis with 2DSTE is feasible in most segments, but the radial and circumferential strain evaluation was only feasible in approximately half of the patients </plain></SENT>
