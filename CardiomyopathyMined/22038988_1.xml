<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is useful in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial diseases</z:e>, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and tako-tsubo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that quantitative T2 mapping could better delineate myocardial involvement in these disorders versus T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients with suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> or TTCM, referred for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, who met established diagnostic criteria underwent myocardial T2 mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2 values were averaged in involved and remote myocardial segments, both defined by a reviewer blinded to T2 data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, T2 was 65.2±3.2 ms in the involved myocardium versus 53.5±2.1 ms in the remote myocardium (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In TTCM, T2 was 65.6±4.0 ms in the involved myocardium versus 53.6±2.7 ms in the remote segments (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2 values were similar across remote myocardial segments in patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> myocardial segments in controls (P&gt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T2 maps provided diagnostic data even in patients with difficulty breath holding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A T2 cutoff of 59 ms identified areas of myocardial involvement, with sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T2 mapping revealed regions of abnormal T2 beyond those identified by wall motion abnormalities or late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhancement positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conventional T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery images were uninterpretable in 7 patients because of artifact and unremarkable in 2 patients who had elevated T2 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T2-prepared steady-state-free precession images showed areas of signal hyperintensity in only 17 of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative T2 mapping reliably identifies myocardial involvement in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and TTCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>T2 mapping delineated a greater extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> in both conditions compared with that identified by wall motion abnormalities, T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery imaging, T2-prepared steady-state-free precession, or late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Quantitative T2 mapping warrants consideration as a robust technique to identify myocardial injury in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> or TTCM </plain></SENT>
