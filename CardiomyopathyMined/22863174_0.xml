<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice developed <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> 8 weeks after injection with Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), whereas ICM was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV volumes (EDV and ESV) and the ejection fraction (LVEF) of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, ICM and healthy control mice were measured by FDG-PET and compared with reference standard results obtained with 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent monitoring study, LVEF of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice was evaluated by FDG-PET at baseline, and after 4 weeks of treatment, with EPO or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LV volumes and the LVEF as measured by FDG-PET correlated significantly with the MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These correlations were higher in healthy and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice than in ICM mice, in which LVEF measurements were somewhat compromised by absence of FDG uptake in the area of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV volumes (EDV and ESV) were systematically underestimated by FDG-PET, with net bias such that LVEF measurements in both models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> exceeded by 15% to 20% results obtained by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our subsequent monitoring study of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice, we found a significant decrease of LVEF in the EPO group, but not in the saline-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LVEF in the EPO and saline mice significantly correlated with histological scores of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LVEF estimated by ECG-gated FDG-PET significantly correlated with the reference standard MRI, most notably in healthy mice and mice with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET served for longitudinal monitoring of effects of EPO treatment in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mice </plain></SENT>
