<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Suggested treatments include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or β blockers (BBs), but few large series have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 42 patients with DMD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> treated with an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> plus a BB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiograms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate ejection fractions (EFs) were obtained at initiation of therapy (EF &lt;55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> dosage adjustments were made if a continued decrease in EF was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BB therapy was initiated when average heart rate on Holter monitoring exceeded 100 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using paired t test and linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before ACE inhibition, patients (n = 22) demonstrated decreased EF over time (r(2) = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy initiation, mean age was 14.1 ± 4.6 years and mean EF was 44.2 ± 6.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BB therapy was used in 24 of 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean age for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> + BB group was 15.7 ± 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups showed significant improvement (p &lt;0.0001 for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> plus BB) compared to the pretherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with DMD demonstrated a gradual decrease in myocardial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> plus BB resulted in significant improvement compared to pretherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No significant difference occurred in EF improvement between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> plus BB can delay progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
