<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the prognosis of patients with stress (takotsubo) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is relatively favorable, serious complications occur in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that electrocardiography is an essential tool for the diagnosis of stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, with findings highly suggestive of the characteristics of myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the quantitative analysis of electrocardiograhic changes can predict complications in stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study subjects were 85 patients with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 patients developed ≥1 in-hospital complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, intraventricular pressure gradient [&gt;30 mm Hg], cardiogenic shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, and embolism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with complications were likely to have a higher heart rate (96 ± 25 vs 76 ± 17 beats/min, p &lt;0.001), larger sum of ST-segment elevation in 12 leads (median 10.5 mm; interquartile range 5.0 to 17.5 vs 3.0 mm, interquartile range 0 to 7.0; p &lt;0.001) and extension of ST-segment elevation to limb leads (50% vs 12%, p &lt;0.001) than those without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified heart rate (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.07, p = 0.001) and sum of ST-segment elevation in 12 leads (odds ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.39, p &lt;0.001) as significant and independent predictors of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis selected 5.5 mm as the best cutoff value of sum of ST-segment elevation in 12 leads for the prediction of complications, with a sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 73%, respectively, and area under the curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.90, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the extent and magnitude of ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram are potentially useful predictors of in-hospital complications in patients with stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
