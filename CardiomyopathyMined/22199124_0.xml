<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, conduction abnormalities and high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we screened a large cohort of ARVC patients for LMNA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients from unrelated families with borderline (n = 27) or definite (n = 81) diagnosis of ARVC were genetically tested for five desmosomal genes and LMNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one (56.5%) were positive for desmosomal gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 12 protein-coding LMNA exons was performed and mutational screening performed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (4%) without desmosomal gene mutations carried LMNA variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three had severe right ventricular involvement, and during follow-up three died (two suddenly and one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three had conduction abnormalities on resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocardial tissue from two patients showed myocyte loss and fibro-fatty replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one of these, immunohistochemical staining with antibody to plakoglobin showed reduced/absent staining of the intercalated discs in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lamin A/C gene mutations can be found in severe forms of ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lamin A/C gene should be added to desmosomal genes when genetically testing patients with suspected ARVC, particularly when they also have ECG evidence for conduction disease </plain></SENT>
