<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Removal of these autoantibodies improved haemodynamic parameters and left ventricular ejection fraction patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this project is to evaluate whether beta1-AAbs and M2-AAbs predict prognosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2062 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and 824 control subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta1-AAbs and M2-AAbs were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and the correlation between these autoantibodies and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 36 months (0.40 Â± 65 months), 379 (21.56%) cases died-164 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and 215 had ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, SCD occurred in 69 cases (40.37%) of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and in 84 cases (39.07%) of ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positivity for beta1-AAbs in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and ICM was significantly higher than for the controls (8.1% and 8.25% v.s 2.2%, both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, positive M2-AAbs did not show any statistical difference between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis revealed that positive beta1-AAbs were associated with higher mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and that it predicted SCD for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> [hazard ratio (HR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.405-8.471] and ICM (HR 3.749, 95% CI 2.389-5.884) patients, but not non-SCD (NSCD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rates of positive beta1-AAbs were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Positive beta1-AAbs might serve as an independent predictor for SCD in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
