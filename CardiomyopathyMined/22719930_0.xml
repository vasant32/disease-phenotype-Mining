<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracellular signaling pathways utilized by T. cruzi to regulate these mechanisms remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify parasite proteins involved in the TGF-β response, we utilized a combined approach of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) analysis and mass spectrometry (MS) protein identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signaling via TGF-β is dependent on events of phosphorylation, which is one of the most relevant and ubiquitous post-translational modifications for the regulation of gene expression, and especially in trypanosomatids, since they lack several transcriptional control mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show a kinetic view of T. cruzi epimastigotes (Y strain) incubated with TGF-β for 1, 5, 30 and 60 minutes, which promoted a remodeling of the parasite phosphorylation network and protein expression pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The altered molecules are involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as proteolysis, metabolism, heat shock response, cytoskeleton arrangement, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> regulation, translation and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 75 protein spots were up- or down-regulated more than twofold after TGF-β treatment, and from these, 42 were identified by mass spectrometry, including cruzipain-the major T. cruzi papain-like cysteine proteinase that plays an important role in invasion and participates in the escape mechanisms used by the parasite to evade the host immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our study, we observed that TGF-β addition favored epimastigote proliferation, corroborating 2DE data in which proteins previously described to be involved in this process were positively stimulated by TGF-β </plain></SENT>
