<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this short report, we assessed the benefit of cardiac resynchronization in patients with PPCM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systolic dysfunction despite optimal medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For the last 10 years, we managed eight patients diagnosed with PPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of them presented severe systolic dysfunction, and medical treatment resulted in limited improvement from 10% to 25% and from 25% to 28% despite optimal treatment for 9 and 6 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two patients were porposed to receive an implantatable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-CRT treatment, we observed a significant improvement in systolic function from 25% to 45% and 28% to 50%, respectively, and positive remodelling with reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 216 to 144 mL and from 354 to 105 mL, which represent a 34% and a 70% reduction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in charge of patients with PPCM should offer the opportunity of CRT for patients whose cardiac function has not significantly improved under standard medical treatment </plain></SENT>
