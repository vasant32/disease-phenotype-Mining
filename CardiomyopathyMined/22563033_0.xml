<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> can detect morphological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>abnormalities of the left ventricle</z:hpo> (LV) not visualized with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although myocardial crypts (ie, narrow, blood-filled invaginations within the LV wall) have been recognized in HCM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical implications of these structural abnormalities within the broad clinical HCM spectrum are not completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and diagnostic significance of myocardial crypts in HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cine and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and 2-dimensional echocardiography were obtained in 292 consecutive patients with HCM including 31 genotype-positive/phenotype-negative family members without LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (28 ± 16 years; 51% male) and 261 patients with LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (46 ± 18 years; 60% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial crypts (1-6/patient) were identified only by cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in 19 of 31 genotype-positive/phenotype-negative patients (61%) compared with only 10 of 261 (4%) patients with HCM with LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.001) and were absent in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 10 (53%) of the genotype-positive/phenotype-negative patients with crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crypts were confined to the basal LV, most commonly in the ventricular septum (n=21) or posterior LV free wall (n=4), and associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV contractility and absence of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LV myocardial crypts represent a distinctive morphological expression of HCM, occurring with different frequency in HCM patients with or without LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Crypts are a novel cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging marker, which may identify individual HCM family members who should also be considered for diagnostic genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support an expanded role for cardiovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in early evaluation of HCM families </plain></SENT>
