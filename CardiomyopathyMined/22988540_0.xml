<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several imaging techniques are available for the assessment of viable myocardium, based on the detection of preserved perfusion, preserved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, intact cell membrane and mitochondria, and presence of contractile reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear cardiology techniques, dobutamine echocardiography and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography are used to assess myocardial viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years, new advances have improved methods of detecting myocardial viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes the pathophysiology, methods, and impact of detection of myocardial viability, concentrating on recent advances in such methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the literature using search engines MIDLINE, SCOUPS, and EMBASE from 1988 to February 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used key words: myocardial viability, hibernation, stunning, and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed that the presence of viable myocardium was associated with a greater likelihood of survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and LV dysfunction, but the assessment of myocardial viability did not identify patients with survival benefit from revascularization, as compared with medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This topic is still debatable and needs more evidence </plain></SENT>
