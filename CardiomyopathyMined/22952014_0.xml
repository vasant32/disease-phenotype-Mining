<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporter (OCTN) family consists of three transporter isoforms, i.e., OCTN1 (SLC22A4) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5) in humans and animals and Octn3 (Slc22a21) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These transporters are physiologically essential to maintain appropriate systemic and tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> by regulating its membrane transport during intestinal absorption, tissue distribution, and renal reabsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, OCTN2 is a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent, high-affinity transporter of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>, and functional defect of OCTN2 due to genetic mutation causes primary systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> is essential for beta-oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15904">long-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> to produce ATP, OCTN2 gene mutation causes a range of symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003251'>male infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These functional consequences of Octn2 gene mutation can be clearly seen in an animal model, jvs mouse, which exhibits the SCD phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, although the mechanism is not clear, single nucleotide polymorphisms of OCTN1 and OCTN2 genes are associated with increased incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OCTN1 and OCTN2 accept cationic drugs as substrates and contribute to intestinal and pulmonary absorption, tissue distribution (including to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells), and renal excretion of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modulation of the transport activity of OCTN2 by externally administered drugs may cause drug-induced secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Octn3 transports <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> specifically, particularly in male reproductive tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the OCTNs are physiologically, pathologically and pharmacologically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detailed characterization of these transporters will greatly improve our understanding of the pathology associated with common diseases caused by functional deficiency of OCTNs </plain></SENT>
