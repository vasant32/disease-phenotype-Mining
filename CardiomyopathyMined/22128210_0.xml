<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Traditional management of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) involves periodic lifetime clinical screening of family members, an approach that does not identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gene carriers owing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> and significant clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limitations in availability and cost have meant genetic testing is not part of routine clinical management for many HCM families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the addition of genetic testing to HCM family management, compared with clinical screening alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision model was used to determine cost per quality-adjusted life-year and cost for each life-year gained when genetic testing is included in the management of Australian families with HCM, compared with the conventional approach of periodic clinical screening alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $A785 (£510 or €587) per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and $A12 720 (£8261 or €9509) per additional life-year gained making genetic testing a very cost-effective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost of proband genetic testing was an important variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the cost of proband genetic testing decreased, the ICER decreased and was cost saving when the cost fell below $A248 (£161 or €185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mutation identification rate was also important in reducing the overall ICER, although even at the upper limits, the ICER still fell well within accepted willingness to pay bounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of genetic testing to the management of HCM families is cost-effective in comparison with the conventional approach of regular clinical screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for the evaluation of families with HCM, and suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> should have access to specialised cardiac genetic clinics that can offer genetic testing </plain></SENT>
