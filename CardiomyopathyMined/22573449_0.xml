<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that the rates of cross-bridge attachment and dissociation are significantly different in isometrically contracting cardiac myofibrils from right ventricle of WT and Tg-D166V mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To avoid averaging over ensembles of molecules composing muscle fibers, the data was collected from a single molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinetics were derived by tracking the orientation of a single actin molecule by fluorescence anisotropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orientation oscillated between two states, corresponding to the actin-bound and actin-free states of the myosin cross-bridge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cross-bridge in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (healthy) heart stayed attached and detached from thin filament on average for 0.7 and 2.7 s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In FHC heart, these numbers increased to 2.5 and 5.8 s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that alterations in myosin cross-bridge kinetics associated with D166V mutation of RLC ultimately affect the ability of a heart to efficiently pump the blood </plain></SENT>
