<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce the priming volume of the extracorporeal circuit, different components can be combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, an oval-shaped oxygenator (called ExMeTrA) with integrated pulsatile pump was tested in vitro using porcine blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A feasibility study regarding the performance of collapsing and expanding <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes within an oxygenator fiber bundle as a pulsatile pump was previously completed with successful results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study improve upon the previous feasibility results, particularly in terms of gas exchange and filling volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five modules were manufactured in sizes of 20 ± 2.2 ml (priming volume) with fiber surface areas of 0.24 ± 0.027 m(2) and an analytically calculated volume pumping capacity of 692 ± 75 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modules were made of polymethylpentene fibers with dense outer layer to permit long-term applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gas exchange rates at a gas/blood flow ratio of 2:1 were between 64 and 72.7 ml(O)(2)/l(blood) and between 62.5 and 81.5 ml/l(blood), depending on the blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The individual module's pumping capacity ranged from 200-500 ml/min thus providing room for further improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to enhance the pumping capacity while maintaining sufficient gas exchange rates future optimization, adjustments will be made to the inlet and outlet geometries </plain></SENT>
