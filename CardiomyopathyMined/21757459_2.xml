<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single-centre tertiary referral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients 334 consecutively evaluated HCM patients (median age 40 years, 62% male, 92% primary prevention) at risk of SCD treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients (11%) received concurrent cardiac resynchronisation therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 1286 patient-years of follow-up, cardiovascular mortality (including transplantation) occurred in 22 (7%) patients (1.7%/year) and was associated with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV (adjusted HR=9.38, 95% CI 3.31 to 26.55, pâ‰¤0.001), percentage fractional shortening (HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96, p=0.001) and implantation for secondary prevention (HR=0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (8%) patients received appropriate shocks (2.3%/year), which were predicted by baseline fractional shortening (HR=0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five (16%) patients received inappropriate shocks (4.6%/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty (18%) patients experienced implant-related complications (5.1%/year), including two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related events (inappropriate shocks and/or implant complications) were seen in 101 (30%) patients (8.6%/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiac resynchronisation therapy were more likely to develop implant complications than those with single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> (HR=4.39, 95% CI 1.44 to 13.35, p=0.009) and had a higher 5-year cardiovascular mortality than did the rest of the cohort (21% vs 6%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HCM patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> have a significant cardiovascular mortality and are exposed to frequent inappropriate shocks and implant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that new strategies are required to improve patient selection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> and to prevent disease progression in those that receive a device </plain></SENT>
