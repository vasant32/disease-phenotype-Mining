<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by mutations in the genes coding for structural and/or regulatory proteins found in the sarcomere of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of genes, including the heavy chain of beta-myosin (MYH7), myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3), cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) are frequently affected by causal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While exact mutation frequency data has been obtained for various populations, no screening has been reported for Central European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a complete sequencing of MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3 and TNNT2 genes in 100 HCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We discovered mutations in a total of 40 patients (40%), including 4 patients with double mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 different mutation types were detected, of which 17 were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contributions from individual genes were: 24 mutations in MYBPC3 (54.5%), 14 in MYH7 (31.8%), 4 in TNNI3 (9%) and 2 mutations in TNNT2 (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have observed a wide variability in disease manifestation across the different genes/mutation types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have discovered differences in both frequency and distribution of mutations of the two most common genes (MYBPC3 and MYH7) compared to other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most common gene responsible for HCM in our study population was MYBPC3, followed by MYH7, TNNI3 and TNNT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, as well as the dissimilarity to other populations, prevents effective use of a pre-screening test, which would be directed at the most common mutation hotspots, in our population </plain></SENT>
