<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (PPCM) is an often fatal disease that affects pregnant women who are near delivery, and it occurs more frequently in women with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and/or multiple gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of PPCM, and why it is associated with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that PPCM is associated with a systemic angiogenic imbalance, accentuated by pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice that lack cardiac <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1α, a powerful regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, develop profound PPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the PPCM is entirely rescued by pro-angiogenic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In humans, the placenta in late gestation secretes VEGF inhibitors like soluble FLT1 (sFLT1), and this is accentuated by multiple gestation and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This anti-angiogenic environment is accompanied by subclinical cardiac dysfunction, the extent of which correlates with circulating levels of sFLT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous sFLT1 alone caused diastolic dysfunction in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, and profound systolic dysfunction in mice lacking cardiac <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, plasma samples from women with PPCM contained abnormally high levels of sFLT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that PPCM is mainly a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, caused by excess anti-angiogenic signalling in the peripartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data also explain how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> poses a threat to cardiac homeostasis, and why pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and multiple gestation are important risk factors for the development of PPCM </plain></SENT>
