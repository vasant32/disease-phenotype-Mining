<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that alterations of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study studied these pathways in two mouse models of HCM that mainly differ by the presence or absence of truncated mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed in homozygous Mybpc3-targeted knock-in (KI) mice, carrying a HCM mutation and exhibiting low levels of mutant cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), and in Mybpc3-targeted knock-out (KO) mice expressing no cMyBP-C, thus serving as a model of pure cMyBP-C insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the early postnatal development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, both models showed higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and greater proteasomal activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To specifically monitor the degradation capacity of the UPS with age, mice were crossed with transgenic mice that overexpress Ub(G76V)-GFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ub(G76V)-GFP protein levels were fourfold higher in 1-year-old KI, but not KO mice, suggesting a specific UPS impairment in mice expressing truncated cMyBP-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas protein levels of key ALP markers were higher, suggesting ALP activation in both mutant mice, their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels did not differ between the groups, underlying rather defective ALP-mediated degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of key proteins regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> did not reveal specific alterations in KI and KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest (1) UPS activation in early postnatal development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, (2) specific UPS impairment in old KI mice carrying a HCM mutation, and (3) defective ALP as a common mechanism in genetically engineered mice with <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
