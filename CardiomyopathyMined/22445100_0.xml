<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fragmented QRS complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>) were proven to be associated with the prognosis of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data is available regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> in left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>noncompaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVNC), in which the outcome varies greatly and a simple yet practicable prognostic predictor is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> in LVNC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four LVNC patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fragmented narrow QRS (f-nQRS) included single or multiple notches in the R or S wave in at least 2 contiguous electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and QRS duration &lt; 120 ms, fragmented wide QRS (f-wQRS) included more than 2 notches and QRS duration &gt; 120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: f-nQRS and f-wQRS was present in 24 (38%) and 7 (11%) patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 13 patients died and 7 patients underwent heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that compared with the non-f-nQRS group, the f-nQRS group associated with a significantly lower survival (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The f-wQRS group also demonstrated a substantially lower survival as compared with the non-f-wQRS group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated f-nQRS was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (HR: 5.33; P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In LVNC patients, the presence of f-nQRS has significant prognostic value and may provide a valid method of risk stratification </plain></SENT>
