<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another unresolved question is the incidence of these compensatory mechanisms depending on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> etiology and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze these questions, we quantified the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>/protein expressions of six ARs (α(1A), α(1B), α(1D), β(1), β(2), and β(3)) and three GRKs (GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5) in left (LV) and right ventricle (RV) from four donors, 10 patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (IC), 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DC), and 10 patients with nonischemic, nondilated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathies</z:e> (NINDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We correlated the changes in the expressions of ARs and GRKs with clinical variables such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-systolic and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVESD and LVEDD, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main findings were 1) the expression of the α(1A)-AR in the LV positively correlates with LVEF; 2) the expression of GRK3 and GRK5 inversely correlates with LVESD and LVEDD, supporting previous observations about a protective role for both kinases in failing hearts; and 3) β(1)-AR expression is downregulated in the LV and RV of IC, in the LV of DC, and in the RV of NINDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference, better than an increased expression of GRK2 (not observed in IC), determines the lower LVEF in IC and DC vs. NINDC </plain></SENT>
