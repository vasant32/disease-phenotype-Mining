<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a transgenic mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> of cardiac-specific H-Ras-G12V induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> provided a system to explore the potential of using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to obtain a disease-relevant molecular profile from amount-limited specimens that are routinely used in pathological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our method employs a two-stage <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>-assisted solubilization to digest lysates prepared from 8-μm-thick fresh-frozen histological tissue sections of diseased/experimental and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coupling this approach with a nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) and a hybrid linear ion trap/Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS resulted in the identification of 704 and 752 proteins in hypertrophic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (control) myocardium, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease driving H-Ras protein along with vimentin were unambiguously identified by LC-MS in hypertrophic myocardium and cross-validated by immunohistochemistry and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathway analysis involving proteins identified by MS showed strong association of proteomic data with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the MS identification and subsequent cross-validation of Wnt3a and β-catenin, in conjunction with IHC identification of phosphorylated GSK-3β and nuclear localization of β-catenin, provided evidence of Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway activation secondary to Ras activation in the course of pathogenic myocardial hypertrophic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our method yields results indicating that the described proteomic approach permits molecular discovery and assessment of differentially expressed proteins regulating H-Ras induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selected proteins and pathways can be further investigated using immunohistochemical techniques applied to serial tissue sections of similar or different origin </plain></SENT>
