<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that Astragalus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharides</z:chebi> (APS) administration was sufficient to improve the systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> and cardiac dysfunction in diabetic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the precise role of APS therapy in the pathogenesis of myocardial lipotoxity in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, db/db diabetic mice and myosin heavy chain (MHC)- peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α mice were characterized and administrated with or without APS with C57 wide- type mice as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS treatment strikingly improved the myocyte triacylglyceride accumulation and cardiac dysfunction in both db/db mice and MHC-PPARα mice, with the normalization of energy metabolic derangements in both db/db diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the activation of PPARα target genes involved in myocardial fatty acid uptake and oxidation in both db/db diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts was reciprocally repressed by APS administration, while PPARα-mediated suppression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization of both diabetic hearts and MHC-PPARα hearts was reversed by treatment with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that APS therapy could prevent the development of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> through a mechanism mainly dependent on the cardiac PPARα-mediated regulatory pathways </plain></SENT>
