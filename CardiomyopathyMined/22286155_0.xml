<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and bone loss, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and the prognostic significance of bone mass changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Total body (TB) and femoral (F) bone mineral density (BMD), and T- and Z-scores in the femur were measured in 60 men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> (56 ± 11 years) and 13 age-matched men free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composite study endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or inotrope dependency during a median 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score were significantly lower in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their PTH levels were also significantly increased (111 ± 59 vs. 39 ± 14; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in New York Heart Association classes III-IV compared with those in classes I-II demonstrated significantly lower TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score, and higher PTH (136 ± 69 vs. 86 ± 31; P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased PTH levels were correlated with reduced TBBMD (P = 0.003), FBMD (P = 0.002), and femur T-score (P = 0.001), reduced cardiac index (P = 0.01) and VO(2) peak (P &lt; 0.0001), and increased wedge pressure (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low TBBMD [hazard ratio (HR) 0.003, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.58; P = 0.03] and Z-score (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90; P = 0.017) were associated with adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
