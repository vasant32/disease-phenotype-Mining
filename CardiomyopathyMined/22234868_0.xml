<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that male KLF10-encoded TGFβ Inducible Early Gene-1 knock-out mice (TIEG-/-) develop HCM with 13-fold up-regulation of PTTG1-encoded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pituitary tumor</z:e>-transforming gene 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized TIEG1 could be a novel candidate gene in the pathogenesis of genotype negative HCM in humans, possibly through a loss of its repression on PTTG1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 923 unrelated patients from two independent HCM centers was analyzed for mutations in TIEG's four translated exons using DHPLC and direct DNA-sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Site directed mutagenesis was performed to clone novel variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of TIEG1 mutations on SMAD7 and PTTG1 promoters was studied using transient transfection and luciferase-assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of PTTG1 in cardiac tissue was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine levels of PTTG1 protein in hypertrophic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six novel TIEG1 missense mutations were discovered in six patients (two males/four females, mean age at diagnosis 56.2±23 years, MLVWT 20.8±4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to WT TIEG1, five TIEG1 mutants significantly increased PTTG1 promoter function similar to TIEG1-/--mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By IHC, PTTG1-protein expression was significantly increased in multiple models of hypertrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, including TIEG1-mutation positive HCM compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first article to associate mutations in TIEG1 to human disease with the discovery of six novel, HCM-associated variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional assays suggest a role for PTTG1 in the pathogenesis of TIEG1-mediated HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of PTTG1 seems to be a common pathway in hypertrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, including TIEG1-mediated HCM </plain></SENT>
