<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and prognostic significances of dynamic HRV changes in patients with stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1719712" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takotsubo syndrome</z:e> (TS) by means of linear and nonlinear analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with TS were included in study after complete noninvasive and invasive cardiovascular diagnostic evaluation and compared to an age and gender matched control group of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Series of R-R interval and of ST-T interval values were obtained from 24-h ECG recordings after digital sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRV analysis was performed by 'range rescaled analysis' to determine the Hurst exponent, by detrended fluctuation analysis to quantify fractal long-range correlation properties, and by approximate entropy to assess time-series predictability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term fractal-scaling exponents were significantly higher in patients with TS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases, opposite to lower approximate entropy and Hurst exponent, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables normalized in a few weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dynamic HRV analysis allows assessing changes in complexity features of HRV in TS patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and to monitor recovery after treatment, thus complementing traditional ECG and clinically analysis </plain></SENT>
