<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are growing numbers of reports identifying sex-related differences in the development and prognosis of HF and cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the experience of 1,607 VAD implantations in our institution we are the first to analyze our data to determine gender distribution in our patient populations and the effect of gender on outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the total 1,456 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>, 1,225 were male and 231 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three age groups-below 13 years (group 1, n = 100), between 13 and 50 years (group 2, n = 540) and older than 50 years (group 3, n = 824) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival, HF etiology, and procedural success, defined as 30-day and 5-year survival were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1 the gender distribution was equal; the leading HF etiology was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">DCMP</z:chebi>) with 17% in male (n = 17) and 19% in female (n = 19) patients, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital diseases</z:e> (13% in male versus 9% in female) and postcardiotomy failure (13% in male versus 8% in female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in 5-year survival and procedural success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 2, significantly more men (n = 451, p &lt; 0.0001) were supported by VADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15918">DCMP</z:chebi> was the major cause for VAD implantation (54%) and was significantly more frequent in men (57.6%, p = &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male patients were older (mean age = 37.1 years, p &lt; 0.0001), with a longer median support time (151.6 days, p &lt; 0.0001) and a higher median weight (78.2 kg, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen in procedural success whereas 5-year survival was better in men than in women (53% vs. 42%, p = 0.02).Group 3 consisted of 723 male patients and 101 female patients (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was the main HF etiology (37.9 %) and it was significantly more often the reason for left ventricular assist device support in men (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in procedural success; 5-year survival showed a better outcome in men (49% vs. 25%, p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients supported by a VAD, gender has a significant impact on the distribution of diagnoses in the adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Women were underrepresented in the age group 13-50 years, and 50 years and older, and women had a higher risk for mortality on VAD support in the adult age groups (groups 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
