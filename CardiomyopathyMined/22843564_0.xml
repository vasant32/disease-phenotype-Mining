<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a stress-responsive cytokine and is emerging as a biomarker of cardiac remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide unloading of the left ventricle, resulting in partial reverse remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study GDF-15 in patients with a non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) during LVAD support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed circulating GDF-15 in 30 patients before and 1, 3, and 6 months after LVAD implantation and before heart transplantation or explantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of GDF-15 were evaluated in myocardial tissue obtained prior to and after LVAD support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating GDF-15 was significantly higher before LVAD implantation as compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1 month of mechanical support, GDF-15 levels were significantly decreased compared with pre-implantation levels (P &lt; 0.001) and remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating GDF-15 was significantly correlated with kidney function and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GDF-15 mRNA and protein expression in the myocardium were hardly detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High circulating levels of GDF-15 in patients with end-stage non-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> and kidney function and decline strongly after 1 month of mechanical unloading, remaining stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, cardiac <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of GDF-15 are very low, suggesting that the heart is not an important source of GDF-15 production in these patients </plain></SENT>
