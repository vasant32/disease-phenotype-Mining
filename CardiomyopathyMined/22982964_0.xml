<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We appreciate the Letter to the Editor by Drs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Martins and Baruteua regarding our recent manuscript describing antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) patients.(1) The comment regarding the adequate number of ATP sequences to program in this population is an excellent one that is, as yet, unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has become our practice over time to program more ATP attempts, as the growing ATP literature (albeit primarily in adults with ischemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) continues to support the safety and efficacy of such a strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further support for this strategy in children and CHD patients is provided by the lack of symptoms in the few patients in our study who had successful termination by the 4(th), 5(th), and 8(th) ATP sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As noted, a limitation of our retrospective analysis is the non-uniform ATP programming across the study population, enrolled over a 14 year period during which we initially programmed 1 or 2 ATP attempts and more recently programmed multiple sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we are unable to determine definitively the optimal number of ATP sequences to program in children and CHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We agree that a prospective study, similar to the one performed by Martins et al.(2) (included as a reference and in Table 2 of our manuscript), is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This would require a multicenter effort to obtain an adequately powered sample of children and CHD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until such data are available, we should consider the available evidence, which favors programming more ATP sequences for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> or CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We agree with the comment that those with primary electrical disease are not good candidates for aggressive ATP programming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We too hope that our paper, as well as the points raised in the Letter to the Editor, will help avoid deleterious and painful shocks </plain></SENT>
