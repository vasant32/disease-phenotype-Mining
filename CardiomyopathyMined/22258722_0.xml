<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiac ECM is an active system that responds to the stresses to which it is exposed and in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart is adapted to facilitate efficient mechanical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are marked differences in the short- and medium-term changes in ventricular geometry and cardiac ECM that occur as a result of volume overload, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this, there is a widespread view that a common remodeling "phenotype" governs the final progression to end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in different forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review article, we make the case that this interpretation is not consistent with the clinical and experimental data on the topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We argue that there is a need for new theoretical and experimental models that will enable stresses acting on the ECM and resultant deformations to be estimated more accurately and provide better spatial resolution of local signaling mechanisms that are activated as a result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These developments are necessary to link the effects of structural remodeling with altered cardiac mechanical function </plain></SENT>
