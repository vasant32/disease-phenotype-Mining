<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are either confined to the heart or are part of generalised systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> related disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Determination of exact aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> can be difficult but remains important for both treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging allows comprehensive assessment of patients suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and is therefore being increasingly used in diagnosis and follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents the main features of common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and highlights its role in providing additional information over and above the traditional diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
