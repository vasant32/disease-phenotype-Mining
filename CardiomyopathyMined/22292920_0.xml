<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is most often found in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is clinically relevant during stressful conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCM reverses after liver transplantation and potentially has a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatorenal syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI), cardiac dysfunction is a feature with low ejection fraction, decreased left ventricular chamber size and electrocardiographic abnormalities, including QT interval prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With optimal diagnostic tests, AI is present in approximately 10% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, particularly in those with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation and decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors, and high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels are common to both cardiac conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, AI may play a role in CCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Steroid replacement therapy reverses cardiac changes in AI, and may do so for CCM, with important therapeutic implications; this needs formal evaluation </plain></SENT>
