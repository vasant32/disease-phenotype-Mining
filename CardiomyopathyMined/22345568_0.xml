<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is thought to play a key role in genesis and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myocardial effect of sympathetic stimulation on myocardial repolarization in humans is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of direct and reflex sympathetic stimulation on ventricular repolarization in patients with postinfarct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of direct sympathetic stimulation were assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, while those of reflex sympathetic stimulation were assessed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> infusion in ICM patients (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local repolarization was measured from intracardiac electrograms that were used to calculate the activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate of action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in repolarization in patients with ICM; the decrease in ARI from baseline was 72.9 ± 9.1 ms in more viable regions, 64.5 ± 8.9 ms in the scar, and 54.9 ± 9.1 ms in border zones (P = 0.0002 and 0.014 comparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and scar to border zones, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi>, the ARI at the border zones decreased significantly more than either scar or surrounding viable myocardium, which showed an increase in ARI (P = 0.014 and 0.08 comparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and scar to border zones, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> increased ARI dispersion by 70%, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> increased ARI dispersion by 230% when ICM patients were compared to those with structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts (P = 0.0015 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In humans, both direct and reflex sympathetic stimulations increase regional differences in repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue surrounding the scar appears denervated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dispersion of ARI in response to sympathetic stimulation is significantly increased in patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
