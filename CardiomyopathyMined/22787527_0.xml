<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A hypertrophied muscle band (HMB) in the left ventricle (LV), which can be misinterpreted as apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, is a rare echocardiographic finding in a patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Not only are symptoms produced, but changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) are limited to the repolarization phase and show no progression even in a large HMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we report a case of a 25-year-old woman who visited a local medical clinic due to epigastric discomfort in January 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour Holter ECG showed multiple premature ventricular complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An HMB (3.23 Ã— 10.8 cm) was observed on two-dimensional echocardiography that ran toward the interventricular septum (IVS) across the LV and divided the LV into apical and basal cavities at the apical one-third of the LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although LV wall thickness showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, flow acceleration was observed between the HMB and IVS and revealed dagger-shaped with a high pressure gradient up to 30 mmHg in continuous wave Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circumferential band-like <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> was observed at the LV apex on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myocardial thinning and prominent trabeculae were present from the proximal to distal HMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, contractility was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the myocardial thinning site, regional wall motion abnormality was not observed in cine images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal fatty accumulation was evident at the base of the HMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis, whereas left ventriculography showed septation at the apical one-third of the LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged without any medication </plain></SENT>
