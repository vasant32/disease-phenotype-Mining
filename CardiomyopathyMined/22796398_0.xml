<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to investigate the PON1 polymorphisms Gln192Arg and Leu55Met in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> patients and correlate them with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 106 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> and 26 healthy individuals were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both polymorphisms were assessed in the DNA of blood samples using PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was calculated for the genotypes and statistical analyses were realized using the Chi-Squared test with Yates correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele frequencies of the polymorphism Gln192Arg for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> patients and control were 0.38 and 0.25, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the frequencies for Gln192Arg polymorphism between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> patients and controls revealed a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical information was obtained from 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with the Gln192Arg polymorphism showed different cardiovascular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher frequency of the Gln192Arg polymorphism among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> patients highlighted the possibility of a correlation between the PON1 genetic variation and the phenotypes because the disease has a wide range of symptoms not explained exclusively by mutations on the GLA gene </plain></SENT>
