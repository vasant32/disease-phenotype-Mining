<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on survival in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>) in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 206 patients with NYHA Functional Class II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; or = 35, including 107 patients implanted with CRT devices in combination with continuous drug therapy (DT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 107 patients, 48 were diagnosed as having non-ischemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> (NCMP), 59 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 99 patients (12 with NCMP and 87 with CHD) were on DT only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later on the patients from both groups were divided into subgroups according to the treatment policy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>: CRT + DT or DT only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 24 +/- 18.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that overall survival in the patients on CRT + DT was significantly higher than in those on DT (70 and 49%, respectively; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the chosen treatment policy in the NCMP subgroup showed no significant differences in survival rates in the patients receiving CRT + DT or DT (74 versus 78%, respectively; p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the survival rates in the CHD patients on CRT + DT were significantly higher than those in the DT subgroup (68 versus 44%; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CRT significantly reduces overall mortality in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that this effect was achieved mainly in patients with CHD, rather than in those with NCMP </plain></SENT>
