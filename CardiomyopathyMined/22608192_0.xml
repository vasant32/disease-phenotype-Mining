<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study has aimed to describe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the Chagas-infected population in the north metropolitan area of Barcelona (406,000 inhabitants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective and multicentric study was performed in 3 hospitals and 1 International Health Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Trypanosoma cruzi positive serology, regardless of the requesting reason.Results The 139 diagnosed cases represent an annual incidence of: a) 0.68/10,000 inhabitants and, b) 73.2/10,000 immigrants coming from endemic zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 80 (57.6%) had alterations in some complementary tests: cardiologic 62 (44.6%), digestive 38 (27.3%) and 20 (14.4%) both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the Brazilian Consensus of Chagas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, they were classified as: 0=84 (60.4%); a=40 (28.7%); b1=4 (2.9%), b2=10 (7.2%) and c/d=1 (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with benznidazole (5mg/kg/24h for 60 days) was prescribed in 116 (83.4%) patients, 89 (76.7%) of whom completed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary effects were recorded in 56 (50.9%), which made it necessary to withdraw it in 21 (19.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fewer cases of Chagas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>/disease than expected have been diagnosed in the North Metropolitan area of Barcelona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The series contains a high number of patients and there may be an elevated number of immigrants from endemic zones who have the asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and who were unaware of their condition </plain></SENT>
