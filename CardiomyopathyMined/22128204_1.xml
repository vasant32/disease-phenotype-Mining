<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, the prognostic capability of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to predict outcomes has been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditional risk markers do not at present adequately predict outcomes in either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which are the two most common causes of primary heart muscle disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of these existing markers reflect underlying disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given the important role <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is thought to play in the pathogenesis and sequelae of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, the presence and amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> has been proposed as a potential novel risk factor for adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the evidence for late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement as a prognostic marker in dilated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and highlights the challenges ahead </plain></SENT>
