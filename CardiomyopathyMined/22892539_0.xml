<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to search for novel disease-associated mutations in the two human titin-binding proteins myopalladin and its amino-terminal-interacting partner cardiac ankyrin-repeat protein (CARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 255 cases with familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, we analyzed the coding regions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> corresponding intron flanks located in the MYPN and CARP-encoding ANKRD1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two heterozygous missense mutations were detected in the MYPN gene (p.R955W and p.P961L), but neither of these mutations was found in 300 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both mutations were located in the α-actinin-binding region of myopalladin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endomyocardial biopsies from the p.R955W carrier showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcellular localization of myopalladin and α-actinin in cardiac myocytes, while their regular sarcomeric staining pattern was significantly disrupted in the p.P961L carrier, indicating that disturbed myofibrillogenesis and altered sarcomere assembly are the cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ANKRD1 gene, we identified synonymous base exchanges (c.108T&gt;C and c.-79C&gt;T, respectively), but no non-synonymous mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have identified novel missense mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like domain of myopalladin, which have either no or profound effects on the molecular composition of the sarcomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to our epidemiological data, the prevalence of ANKRD1 mutations seems to be lower than that of its binding partner myopalladin, indicating the clinical significance of myopalladin for the functional integrity of the sarcomeric apparatus and the protection against <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 15 August 2012; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.173 </plain></SENT>
