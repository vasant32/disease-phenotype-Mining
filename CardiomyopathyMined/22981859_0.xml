<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> characterized by a noncompacted myocardial layer in the left ventricle, primarily diagnosed by echocardiographic and magnetic resonance criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is an imaging method that has been increasingly used in cardiac evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, tomographic criteria to diagnose LVNC have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We assessed the structural characteristics of LVNC with MDCT and proposed tomographic criteria that may differentiate LVNC from healthy subjects and patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> that might be associated with increased myocardial trabeculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2007 and June 2009 we studied 10 consecutive patients with LVNC diagnosed by echocardiogram and/or magnetic resonance imaging who underwent electrocardiogram-gated coronary CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium (NC/C ratio) in end diastole in each of the 17 segments established by the American Heart Association (excluding the apex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with 9 healthy subjects, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> to determine the cutoff that would distinguish patients with LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When considering involvement of more than 1 segment, the NC/C ratio of 2.2 distinguished pathologic noncompaction, with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the involvement of ≥2 segments allows the distinction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LVNC from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> and from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LVNC can be accurately diagnosed with MDCT when using a cutoff NC/C ratio of 2.2 at end diastole involving ≥2 segments </plain></SENT>
