We performed a transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion on rats and investigated whether feeding an aqueous extract of Mycoleptodonoides aitchisonii, an edible mushroom, affected metabolism of monoamines in the cerebral cortex, possibly protecting against ischemic damage. Seventeen days after the surgery, concentrations of the dopamine (DA) metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and of homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebral cortex of the M. aitchisonii-fed group (MV) were higher than in the control ischemia (CV) group. The turnover rate of DA, which was indicated by (DOPAC+HVA)/DA, for the CV group was significantly lower than for the MV group, and the MV group value was the same rate as the sham-operated group. These data indicate that M. aitchisonii affects the dopaminergic neuronal system following brain ischemia damage in the cerebral cortex.
