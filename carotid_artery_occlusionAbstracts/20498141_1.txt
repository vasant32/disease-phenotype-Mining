Neurological complications and mortality within 30 days following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) alone or with concomitant cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were assessed in patients with or without contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (CO-ICA).Of 335 patients undergoing CEA, 173 underwent concomitant cardiac surgery with CPB. Group A consisted of 260 patients without CO-ICA and group B of 75 patients with CO-ICA. The neurological complications (peripheral nerve damage, transient ischemic attack [TIA], prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit [PRIND], and stroke) and the Rankin index within 24 hours and 30 days postoperatively were compared. Strokes within 24 hours were significantly increased (P = .006) in group B (11%) compared with A (3.1%); TIA and PRIND did not differ (P = .33). The overall neurological complications and in particular for peripheral neurological damage, TIA/PRIND, and stroke did not differ within the 30-day-period postsurgery. A significantly higher stroke rate within 24 hours postsurgery occurred in patients with CO-ICA.
