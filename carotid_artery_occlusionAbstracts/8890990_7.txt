The EC-IC Bypass Study Group could not detect any benefit from surgery compared to medical management in the prevention of stroke in 1985 [15]. During the past years surgical revascularization was re-evaluated and considered as an appropriate treatment for a small subgroup of patients with recurrent focal cerebral ischaemia and impaired haemodynamics. This retrospective study examines the long-term benefit and patency rate of bypass. We present a follow-up of 5.6 years of 47 patients, all of whom underwent bypass surgery after 1985. Forty patients suffered recurring transient ischaemic attacks due to uni- or bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Examination included neurologic status, TCD with CO2 or Diamox challenge, angiography, CT and SPECT scans. Neurological improvement was seen in 23% of patients with better results after early surgery, a worsening in 22% suffering further ischaemic events on a postoperative average of 2.8 years. Patency rate for vein graft material was 50%, for the STA-MCA procedure 91%. Occlusion of the vein graft occurred on an average after 1.4 years, other anastomosis after 2.7 years. We conclude that only few patients derived long-term benefit from EC-IC bypasses. Functioning of the bypass worsens over time, suggesting a role for surgery predominantly in the first year of ischaemic events due to insufficient collateral supply. Actual indications for bypass surgery may be patients with failure of maximal medical therapy and progressive ischaemia and haemodynamic compromise.
