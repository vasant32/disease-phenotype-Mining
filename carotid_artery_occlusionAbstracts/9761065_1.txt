The authors report the occurrence of ipsilateral transient cavernous sinus syndrome during balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) and discuss the involved pathomechanisms. The authors reviewed their series of 129 BTOs of the ICA performed between 1989 and 1996. Two patients developed facial paresthesias and transient palsies of the third through sixth cranial nerves during test occlusion of the cervical ICA. The tests were performed prior to planned permanent carotid artery occlusion for the treatment of a neck sarcoma in one patient and a giant cavernous carotid artery aneurysm in the other. The patients' symptoms resolved with deflation of the balloon. When the balloon was subsequently inflated above the inferior cavernous sinus artery (ICSA), one of the patients complained of mild facial discomfort. There was no contralateral weakness or mental status change during test occlusion in either patient. Angiography demonstrated good filling of the ipsilateral intracranial circulation via collateral vessels of the circle of Willis. In these two cases, the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus were likely supplied by the ICA via the meningohypophyseal trunk and the ICSA. In each case, there was excellent blood supply to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere; however, there was probably inadequate retrograde filling of the cranial nerve collateral vessels located where the meningohypophyseal trunk and ICSA originated. These cases emphasize the importance of a patent external carotid artery-ICA connection for successful cervical carotid artery occlusion. Neurological examination during BTO was critical to interpret the clinical manifestations caused by the hemodynamic changes.
