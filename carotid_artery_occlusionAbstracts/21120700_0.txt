We present a case of spontaneous recanalization of the internal carotid artery (ICA) that occurred in a 51-year-old male patient. The occlusion of the right ICA was asymptomatic and was detected incidentally during imaging of the opposite carotid artery. The patient underwent neuroradiologic analysis and a tapered, flame-like occlusion suggestive of the right ICA dissection was detected. One month later, a carotid Doppler ultrasound demonstrated patent right carotid artery with normal spectral flow. Five-month follow-up showed that the ICA remained patent.
