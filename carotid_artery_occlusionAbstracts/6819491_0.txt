The gerbil model for stroke, using permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion and restriction of the contralateral artery, was used to assess exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) effect on cerebral ischemia. TRH immediately post-occlusion, compared to saline controls, significantly increased mortality (P = 0.025). This was supported by worsening reflected in the stroke index and time to death. Thyrotropin (0.1 IU, i.p.) in the same model was without effect. These surprising results were unexpected due to the beneficial response to the pharmacologically related naloxone.
