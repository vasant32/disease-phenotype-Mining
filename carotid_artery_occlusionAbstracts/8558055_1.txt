The etiology of most penetrating neck injuries is caused by missiles or stabbings. Irrespective of the cause of injury, management strategies require that life-threatening injuries to underlying deep neck structures such as esophagus, trachea, or carotid artery be promptly identified. A case is reported in which occlusion of the common carotid artery resulted from a dog bite to the neck. The patient presented to the emergency department with four neck lacerations but lacked focal neurologic symptoms suggestive of such an underlying deep neck injury. The carotid injury was identified by preoperative angiography and was repaired with a reversed saphenous vein interposition graft. The patient had full recovery without neurologic sequela. While injuries to deep neck structures as a result of animal bites are rare, these patients should be evaluated according to accepted protocols to exclude or identify such life-threatening injuries.
