Three (0.5%) of 612 patients with an acute ischemic stroke in the carotid territory also had ipsilateral optic nerve infarction. They had unilateral or bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and reversed flow in the ophthalmic artery. Hemodynamic infarction was suggested by triggering by a drop in blood pressure, decreased ophthalmic artery flow and perfusion pressure, and cerebral infarction in a watershed area. The "optico-cerebral syndrome" suggests internal carotid artery occlusion with hemodynamic disturbances. In carotid disease, monocular blindness may be due to an optic nerve lesion sparing the retina.
