 CONTEXT: The ischemic brain lesions induced in rats by temporary occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and restoration of blood flow to an ischemic brain region is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species with consequent reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the neuroprotective potential of Hibiscus rosa sinensis L. (Malvaceae) in a bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion model of global cerebral ischemic reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals underwent 30 min BCCA occlusion and 45 min reperfusion. The methanol extract of H. sinensis (100, 200, 300 mg/kg/day for 6 days, p.o.) was administered 30 min before induction of BCCA occlusion. RESULTS: The bilateral common carotid artery occlusion resulted in increase in lipid peroxidation, and reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH) activity. The extract attenuated the ischemic reperfusion-induced increase in lipid peroxidation and fall in SOD, CAT, and GSH levels. The cerebral hypoperfusion caused a propensity towards anxiety and was accompanied by deficits of learning and memory. The extract ameliorated anxiety and there was improvement of learning and memory. Discussion: The administration of H. sinensis prevented the oxidative stress and the biochemical changes associated with cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury. The mechanism of such protection of H. sinensis may be due to cerebral adaptation, through augmentation of cellular antioxidants such as GSH, SOD and CAT. The results suggest the protective role of H. sinensis in ischemic reperfusion injury. CONCLUSION: This study indicates the beneficial role of H. sinensis in cerebrovascular insufficiency states and dementia.
