OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard procedure for the majority of patients with high-grade symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis and also for specified high-grade asymptomatic stenoses; however, a proportion of patients are treated with carotid endovascular therapy. We aimed to document medium-term clinical and neurosonographical outcome after carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS: 53 patients (mean age: 65 +/- 8 years) with high-grade (> or = 70 % by means of duplex sonography) carotid artery stenosis were enrolled into the study. Nineteen patients had asymptomatic, 34 patients had symptomatic stenoses. All patients had a pre-interventional CT, Doppler and duplex sonography, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) prior to the procedural DSA. All patients were offered CEA as the gold-standard procedure and as an alternative to CAS. Both clinical and Duplex sonographical follow-up was obtained at day 1 and 7, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 12, and every subsequent 6 months after the procedure. Mean follow-up time was 22 +/- 1.6 months (+/- SEM). RESULTS: 2/53 patients suffered from stroke. A further 2 patients suffered from carotid artery occlusion shortly after CAS. The cumulative rate of restenosis during follow-up was 24.5 % (13/53). Four of these (7.5 %) were of high-grade and led to further interventional or surgical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of restenosis was found during follow-up after CAS. Our analysis of non-selected patients emphasizes that CEA remains the gold-standard procedure for the treatment of symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. The frequently performed endovascular treatment of carotid stenosis outside the setting of a randomized controlled trial is not supported by our data.
