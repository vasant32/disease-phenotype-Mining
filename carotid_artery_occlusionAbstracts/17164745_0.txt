AIM: A few studies have observed reduced vascular reserve measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to be a risk factor for stroke in patients with carotid artery occlusion, but stenosis has been excluded from these former studies. This study has evaluated the prognosis of reduced vascular reserve in patients with stenosis, and the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on these patients. METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed as having >70% stenosis of the carotid artery at the University of Tokyo Hospital, between 2001 and 2004, underwent acetazolamide-stress SPECT test first. A resting SPECT study was performed on a different day from the stressed SPECT study. The patients were grouped as having reduced vascular reserve or normal vascular reserve from the SPECT results. Analysis of risk factors and the stroke-free curve analysis for reduced vascular reserve was performed. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 24 (60%) had reduced vascular reserve and 18 underwent CEA. The mean follow-up period was 21.5+/-15.5 months (mean+/-SD). Four strokes occurred during follow-up: in 1 patient with CEA and 3 without CEA. All stroke patients had reduced vascular reserve. The patients with reduced vascular reserve without any surgery had a significantly lower stroke-free rate compared with those with normal vascular reserve or reduced vascular reserve, but also receiving CEA. CONCLUSIONS: We propose performing SPECT tests in patients with severe carotid stenosis regardless of symptoms, and performing CEA on those with a reduction in vascular reserve.
