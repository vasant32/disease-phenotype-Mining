Effects of ergot alkaloids, nicergoline (NIC), on survival rate, brain water content, local cerebral blood flow (LCBF: 14C-iodoantipyrine) and glucose utilization (LCGU: 14C-2-deoxyglucose) were examined after bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Two series of study were performed; the permanent BCAO and 3-hr-BCAO study. After permanent BCAO, the survival rate at 24 hrs of 32% (8 mg/kg, i.p.) or 38% (16mg/kg) in NIC group was higher than that in non-treated group (12%). At the end of 3-hr-BCAO, the increase in water content (dry-wet) in di-mesencephalon was less in NIC (100 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) group than that in non-treated group. The decrease in LCBF in caudate-putamen (CP), parietal cortex (PC), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus (HT), and substantia nigra (SN) were less in NIC group than those in non-treated group. At the 2-hr-reperfusion after 3-hr-BCAO, the decrease in LCBF in TH and HT were less in NIC group than those in non-treated group. The LCGU in sensory motor cortex, CP, PC, HT, inferior colliculus and pons-reticular were higher in NIC group than those in non-treated group. From these results, it is concluded that nicergoline may have ameliorative effects on survival rate related to the prevention of decreased cerebral blood flow and metabolism following brain ischemia.
