Common carotid artery occlusion is not necessarily associated with thrombosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Noninvasive imaging of the carotid bifurcation with colour-coded Doppler sonography demonstrated patency of the external and internal carotid arteries distal to a common carotid occlusion in 4 patients which could be proven surgically. Identification of internal carotid artery patency could be demonstrated by angiography in two of the patients while in the other two cases angiography was inconclusive. Thus, CCDS provided a correct diagnosis of the internal carotid patency in these patients with common carotid occlusion.
