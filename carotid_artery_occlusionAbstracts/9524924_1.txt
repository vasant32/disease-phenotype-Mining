The purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the modulatory role of platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine), a vasoactive phospholipid mediator synthesized by endothelial cells, on the vascular tone and arterial blood pressure. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rabbits, unloading of the carotid sinus baroreceptors by a bilateral carotid artery occlusion elicited a reflex rise in systemic vascular resistance, which was markedly potentiated by pretreating the animals with the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 ([3-4-(2-chlorphenyl-)-9-methyl-6H-thieno-3,2-f-1,2,4-triazolo-4,3 -alpha-1,4 -diazepin-2-yl-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propanone]; 5 mg/kg, i.v.). In contrast, the inhibition of the biosynthesis of NO via NO synthase using N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) neither affected the systemic vasoconstriction induced by carotid artery occlusion nor modified the potentiating effect of WEB 2086. The haemodynamic alterations induced by L-NAME administration were corrected by continuous infusions of the directly-acting vasodilators sodium nitroprusside or diazoxide. The results of the present study confirm previous studies from our group suggesting the involvement of PAF in a negative feedback mechanism effective in the local regulation of vasomotor tone in anaesthetized rabbits, but exclude the participation of NO in this process.
