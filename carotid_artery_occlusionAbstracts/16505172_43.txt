BACKGROUND: Thrombin is the most potent agonist of platelets and plays a critical role in the development of arterial thrombosis. Human platelets express dual thrombin receptors, protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4; however, there are no therapeutic strategies that effectively target both receptors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet aggregation studies demonstrated that PAR4 activity is markedly enhanced by thrombin-PAR1 interactions. A combination of bivalirudin (hirulog) plus a novel PAR4 pepducin antagonist, P4pal-i1, effectively inhibited aggregation of human platelets to even high concentrations of thrombin and prevented occlusion of carotid arteries in guinea pigs. Likewise, combined inhibition of PAR1 and PAR4 with small-molecule antagonists and pepducins was effective against carotid artery occlusion. Coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies revealed that PAR1 and PAR4 associate as a heterodimeric complex in human platelets and fibroblasts. PAR1-PAR4 cofactoring was shown by acceleration of thrombin cleavage and signaling of PAR4 on coexpression with PAR1. CONCLUSIONS: We show that PAR1 and PAR4 form a stable heterodimer that enables thrombin to act as a bivalent functional agonist. These studies suggest that targeting the PAR1-PAR4 complex may present a novel therapeutic opportunity to prevent arterial thrombosis.
