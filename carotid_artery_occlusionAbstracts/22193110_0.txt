Intracranial collaterals provide residual blood flow to penumbral tissue in acute ischemic stroke and contribute to infarct size variability in humans. In the present study, hemodynamic monitoring of the borderzone territory between the leptomeningeal branches of middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery was compared to lateral middle cerebral artery territory, during common carotid artery occlusion and middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The functional performance of intracranial collaterals, shown by perfusion deficit in the territory of leptomeningeal branches either during common carotid artery occlusion or middle cerebral artery occlusion, showed significant variability among animals and consistently predicted infarct size and functional deficit. Our findings indicate that leptomeningeal collateral flow is a strong predictor of stroke severity in rats, similarly to humans. Monitoring of collateral blood flow in experimental stroke is essential for reducing variability in neuroprotection studies and accelerating the development of collateral therapeutics.
