We examined temporal profiles of neurological dysfunctions and compared them with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 changes in ischemic cortical regions after transient focal cerebral ischemia in Mongolian gerbils. Mongolian gerbils (n = 7) underwent right common carotid artery occlusion for 20 minutes. Asymmetric motor behavior and unilateral somatosensory dysfunction were quantified by the elevated body swing test and the bilateral asymmetry test at 0, 2, 3, and 8 days after ischemia. The results were compared to the ADC and T2 changes in the primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. Transient motor dysfunction was observed at day 2 after ischemia. MRI revealed transient and mild ADC decrease without T2 increase at day 2 after ischemia in the primary motor cortex. Persistent somatosensory dysfunction was observed at 2, 3, and 8 days after ischemia, which corresponded to a moderate ADC decrease, and a mild T2 increase in the primary somatosensory cortex at days 2 and 3 after ischemia. Time profiles of neurological deficits concurred with ADC changes of the post-ischemic cortex responsible for the deficits. The post-ischemic lesions responsible for the neurological deficits were detectable by using ADC mapping in the acute phase after transient focal cerebral ischemia.
