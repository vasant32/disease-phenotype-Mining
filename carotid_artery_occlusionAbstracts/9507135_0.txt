The purpose of this study was to determine if nicardipine, a calcium ion channel blocker, affects pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and improves energy metabolism during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Cerebral ischemia was induced, using the bilateral carotid artery occlusion method, for 60 min followed by reperfusion up to 120 min in gerbils. Nicardipine (1 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle-treated) was given to gerbils 30 min prior to the occlusion of the common carotid arteries. PDH activity and metabolites (ATP, PCr, and lactate) were measured in cortex prior to ischemia, immediately following ischemia, and after each reperfusion period. After 60 min ischemia, PDH activity increased in both groups, and was significantly higher in the nicardipine-treated group. After 20 min reperfusion, PDH activity in the nicardipine-treated group recovered to control levels, whereas, the PDH activity in the vehicle-treated group remained elevated, and was higher than the nicardipine-treated animals. At 60 and 120 min reperfusion, the activities in the vehicle-treated group were significantly below control levels, there were no differences, however, between the two groups. ATP and PCr concentrations were markedly depleted immediately after ischemia in both groups. ATP levels at 20 min reperfusion and PCr levels at 60 min reperfusion were significantly higher in the nicardipine-treated group. Lactate concentrations in both groups increased 7-8 fold, similarly, immediately after ischemia. During reperfusion, the lactate remained elevated in both groups, though the levels in the nicardipine-treated group were lower than those in the vehicle-treated group, but not significantly. Nicardipine treatment normalized PDH activity quickly and improved energy metabolism after reperfusion.
