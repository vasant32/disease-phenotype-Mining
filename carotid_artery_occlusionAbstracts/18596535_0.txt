OBJECTIVE: Several different methodologies for proximal occlusion and retrograde suction decompression of large paraclinoid aneurysms have been reported previously. In this article, we describe the novel use of an endovascular embolectomy device (F.A.S.T. funnel catheter; Genesis Medical Interventional, Inc., Redwood City, CA) for temporary internal carotid artery occlusion and suction decompression of an intracranial aneurysm to facilitate surgical clip ligation. The combination of atraumatic occlusion technology and large lumen size makes this technique safer and easier. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old woman with progressive headaches underwent computed tomographic angiography, which revealed an unruptured large left paraclinoid aneurysm. Cerebral angiography confirmed the diagnosis. The patient did not tolerate a balloon test occlusion for therapeutic Hunterian internal carotid occlusion. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for a craniotomy and clip ligation of the aneurysm. INTERVENTION: A standard left pterional craniotomy was performed with opening of the sylvian fissure and exposure of the left paraclinoid aneurysm. Intraoperative angiography with introduction of a new endovascular embolectomy device was performed. The device was deployed to achieve temporary occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery, and aspiration through the central lumen allowed for retrograde suction decompression of the aneurysm. Collapse of the aneurysm through this technique permitted visualization of the aneurysmal neck with successful clip ligation. CONCLUSION: A new endovascular embolectomy device can be used to safely perform suction decompression of large paraclinoid aneurysms to facilitate clip ligation.
