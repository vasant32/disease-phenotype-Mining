We present a minimally invasive optical method, that is, multi-channel time-domain diffuse near-infrared reflectometry of the head to assess cerebral blood perfusion that is applicable at the bed-side and repetitively at short intervals. Following intravenous injection of an ICG bolus, its transit through intra- and extracerebral tissue is monitored based on changes in moments of distributions of times of flight of photons, recorded with a 4-channel instrument simultaneously on both hemispheres. In healthy volunteers, we found that variance of distributions of times of flight of photons is well suited to assess latency and initial slope of the increase in absorption of intracerebral tissue due to the bolus. We successfully applied our method in two patients demonstrating a reversible cerebral perfusion deficit in an ischemic stroke patient who was treated by thrombolysis and in another patient with a permanent impaired unilateral perfusion due to ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. In either case, we observed a difference in bolus transit time between the hemispheres. In the stroke patient, this difference resolved when re-evaluated 1 day after thrombolysis. The study demonstrates the necessity of a technique with sub-nanosecond time resolution to allow for depth discrimination if clinical perfusion monitoring of cerebrovascular diseases is addressed by optical methods.
