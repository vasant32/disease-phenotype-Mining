Among 75 patients in whom internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion was discovered on angiography, 5 presented with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) without suffering a stroke. Although neurological examination was normal, all had evidence for one (in one instance two) hypodense lesion suggesting infarction contralateral to the neurological dysfunction on computed tomography (CT). These infarcts were small and deeply located, being indistinguishable from lacunes in most cases. We suggest that cerebral infarction with transient signs ( CITS ) may be a usual finding in patients with ICA occlusion who suffer isolated TIAs. In these cases, CITS may correspond to incomplete cerebral necrosis related to a well-developed collateral supply, or to recurrent ischemia in the region of an old "silent" infarct. CITS should be differentiated from TIAs, which may be diagnosed only in absence of visible structural lesion.
