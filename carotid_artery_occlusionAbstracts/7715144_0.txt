31 persons without any changes in visual system and 16 patients with vascular lesions were examined using Doppler colour ultrasonography. This method allowed to identify and evaluate the blood flow in central retinal artery, ophthalmic artery and in ciliary arteries. The authors described a typical picture of normal eyeball and orbita as well as the blood flow observed with Doppler pulsation wave. It was found that normal orbital veins were difficult to observe. The pathological changes of the blood flow in carotid artery occlusion, in arterial-cavernous shunt and in retrobulbar neuritis were also described. The authors indicate a great diagnostic usefulness of the method.
