Transient forebrain ischemia is associated with selective neuronal vulnerability and persistent memory deficit. This study compares functional outcome and morphological changes in rats subjected to post-ischemic CA1 or hilus/dentate gyrus region hippocampal fetal transplantation. Ischemia was produced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with hypotension. Fetal hippocampal neurons were transplanted into both sides of the CA1 or hilus/dentate gyrus region of the dorsal hippocampus, 1 week post-ischemia. Four weeks post transplantation, the rats underwent behavioral testing for 5 consecutive days using the water maze trial. All animals were perfusion fixed for morphological studies. Transplants in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus were associated with memory and morphological recovery, while grafts placed into the hilus/dentate gyrus region of the dorsal hippocampus were not. Similarly, neurons transplanted in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus were morphologically similar to CA1 pyramidal cell neurons and stained positive with calbindin D(28k). In contrast the grafts transplanted into the hilus/dentate gyrus region of the dorsal hippocampus were morphologically heterogeneous and staining with calbindin D(28k) was not as robust. Post-ischemic transplantation in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus is effective in improving memory and morphological function.
