A case of tuberculous brain infection following tuberculous meningitis in a 67-year-old man is presented. It was located in an old cerebral infarct associated with left internal carotid artery occlusion. CT demonstrated capsule enhancement in the left temporal area after iodinated contrast medium. Chemotherapy with INH, RFP and SM diminished the lesion and the capsule disappeared thirteen months later. It is suggested that a relatively long clinical history together with the appearance of a thick-walled abscess-like lesion on the CT scan is consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculous brain infection, perhaps an abscess.
