During routine fluorescein angiography, a healthy female dog demonstrated abnormal delayed filling of retinal and choroidal vessels. Fluorangiographic times were increased four- to fivefold with respect to reference values. Fluorescein angiography, using the same protocol, was repeated two weeks later and a fluorangiogram within reference values was obtained. The abnormal results in the first procedure were suspected to have resulted from partial occlusion of the carotid artery secondary to the restraining method used.
