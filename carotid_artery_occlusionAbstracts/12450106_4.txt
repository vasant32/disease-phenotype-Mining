A 75-year-old man who had suffered from right visual disturbance for 10 years suddenly experienced right cavernous sinus syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant thrombosed aneurysm in the right cavernous sinus extending to the right middle cranial fossa. Digital subtraction angiography disclosed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at the petrous portion and good cross filling in the right-sided circulation through the anterior communicating artery. There was no filling of the aneurysm. In this case, the mechanism of parent artery occlusion is unclear, but direct compression and stretching of the parent artery by the aneurysm may be involved.
