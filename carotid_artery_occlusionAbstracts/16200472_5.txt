Occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) is considered to have a significant impact on the outcome of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The purpose of this study was to review one center's experience concerning CEA opposite an occluded ICA, to see whether results differed from those obtained in patients with patent contralateral ICA in terms of relevant neurologic complication rate (RNCR, fatal + disabling stroke), stroke-free rate, and survival rate. From January 1997 to December 2002, 1,381 patients underwent a total of 1,445 CEAs at the Department of Vascular Surgery of Padua University. Patients were divided into two groups: group A included 144 patients with occlusion of the contralateral ICA and group B consisted of 1,237 patients with a patent contralateral ICA. There was no postoperative mortality in patients of group A, while in group B, two patients died as a result of myocardial infarction and cardiac failure and one died as a direct result of perioperative stroke. Postoperative disabling strokes occurred in one (0.7%) patient in group A and 10 (0.8%) patients in group B (p > 0.5). At 72 months, there were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of RNCR, stroke-free rate, and late death. Our results show that contralateral carotid occlusion does not reduce the safety of CEA. The efficacy in terms of RNCR, stroke-free rate, and late survival is no different in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion.
