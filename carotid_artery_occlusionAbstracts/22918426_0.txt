SUMMARY:CEA contralateral to an ICA occlusion is considered a surgical risk, and CAS may be an alternative for these patients. Our goal was to examine whether CAS improves cerebral hemodynamics on the treated side and on the side of the ICA occlusion, on the basis of measurement of CBF and CVR by using SPECT. The subjects were 8 patients who underwent contralateral CAS. Resting CBF and CVR to acetazolamide were measured by using (123)I-IMP SPECT before and chronically (3-6 months) after CAS. Resting CBF was also measured immediately (<2 hours) after CAS by using (123)I-IMP SPECT. There were no significant differences in resting CBF in both hemispheres immediately after CAS. However, resting CBF and CVR both significantly increased in the chronic period in both hemispheres. Contralateral CAS in patients with ICA occlusion resulted in cerebral hemodynamic improvement on the treated side and on the side of ICA occlusion.
