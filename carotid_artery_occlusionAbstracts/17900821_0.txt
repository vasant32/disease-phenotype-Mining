The present study is designed to investigate the effect of methanolic extract of outer scales and edible portions of Allium cepa bulb on ischemia and reperfusion-induced cerebral injury. Global cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 10 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Pretreatment with methanolic extract of outer scales (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and edible portions (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) of A. cepa bulb markedly reduced cerebral infarct size and attenuated impairment in short-term memory and motor coordination. The protective effect of methanolic extract of outer scales and edible portions of A. cepa bulb was accompanied by a marked decrease in mitochondrial TBARS.
