Several options exist for treating transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), although none can eliminate the risk of cerebral infarction. For carotid TIA, carotid endarterectomy is the preferred therapy in patients with an angiographically demonstrated sclerotic lesion, whereas extracranial-intracranial bypass may be beneficial in patients with carotid artery occlusion or intracranial arterial stenosis. For patients who are not surgical candidates, oral anticoagulants may be helpful, but hemorrhagic complications can occur. Control of risk factors (especially hypertension) and associated medical conditions (especially heart diseases) is necessary. Many unanswered questions about ischemic cerebrovascular disease persists. Further studies and research are necessary.
