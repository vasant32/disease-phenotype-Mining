OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in stent technology have allowed the introduction of more flexible stents that may be tracked more easily in the intracranial vessels. We present a patient with improved cerebral blood flow and metabolism as assessed by positron emission tomography after stent-assisted angioplasty for symptomatic basilar artery stenosis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man, who had undergone left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery for left internal carotid artery occlusion 10 years previously, presented with dizziness, blurred vision, and memory disturbance. Angiography revealed severe stenosis of the proximal basilar artery. Positron emission tomographic scans revealed decreased cerebral blood flow associated with increased oxygen extraction fraction in the entire brain, particularly in the posterior circulation and the left middle cerebral artery territory. Despite medical treatment, the patient experienced worsening visual disturbance and right-sided motor weakness. INTERVENTION: Ticlopidine and aspirin were used as antiplatelet agents. In addition, we used argatroban, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor, as an anticoagulant during the procedure. Predilation with a coronary artery balloon was performed, followed by placement of a GFX 3- by 8-mm stent (Arterial Vascular Engineering, Santa Rosa, CA), with excellent angiographic results. The patient made a good neurological recovery, and the postoperative positron emission tomographic scan demonstrated increases in both cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen with a normalization of oxygen extraction fraction. CONCLUSION: Stent-assisted angioplasty can provide a favorable clinical course as well as improved cerebral perfusion and metabolism for a patient with basilar artery stenosis. Long-term follow-up data and additional clinical experience are required to assess the durability of this approach.
