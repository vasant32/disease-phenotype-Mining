The case of a 4-year-old boy with traumatic internal carotid artery occlusion is reported. This patient developed left upper limb monoparesis and convulsions 62 h after injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed absence of a flow void and a high signal in the C5 portion of the right internal carotid artery. The proximal side of the right carotid siphon was not demonstrated by MR angiography. Carotid angiography revealed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery about 2 cm distal from the cervical carotid bifurcation. MRI appears to be useful to diagnose traumatic internal carotid artery occlusion, especially in children.
