The effects of carotid occlusion on the release of catecholamines in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were investigated in anaesthetized cats. Two aspects of the nucleus (rostral or intermediate NTS) were superfused bilaterally through push-pull cannulae with artificial CSF and the release of the endogenous dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline was determined in the superfusate radioenzymatically. The superfusion rate was 150 microliters/min or 800 microliters/min. In some experiments, superfusion of the intermediate NTS was carried out after denervation of the aortic arch. In the rostral NTS superfused at a rate of 150 microliter/min, bilateral carotid occlusion led to a rise in blood pressure and decreased the release rate of dopamine. These changes continued after occlusion termination. The release rate of noradrenaline was transiently diminished during occlusion. The release of this amine was also decreased after occlusion termination. The release rate of adrenaline was not influenced during carotid occlusion, but it was found to be diminished after termination of the occlusion. Superfusion of the rostral NTS at a rate of 800 microliters/min also reduced the release rate of adrenaline after termination of carotid artery occlusion. In the intermediate NTS (superfusion rate 150 microliters/min) similar effects of the carotid occlusion on the release rates of dopamine and noradrenaline were observed. In this aspect of the NTS, denervation of the aortic arch abolished the decrease in the noradrenaline release during carotid occlusion, while the release rates of dopamine and adrenaline were decreased during and after termination of the carotid occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
