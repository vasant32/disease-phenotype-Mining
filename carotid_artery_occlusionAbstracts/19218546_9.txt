Anti-platelet integrin GPIIIa49-66 antibody (Ab) induces complement-independent platelet oxidative fragmentation and death by generation of platelet peroxide following NADPH oxidase activation. A C-terminal 385-amino acid fragment of ADAMTS-18 (a disintegrin metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs produced in endothelial cells) induces oxidative platelet fragmentation in an identical kinetic fashion as anti-GPIIIa49-66 Ab. Endothelial cell ADAMTS-18 secretion is enhanced by thrombin and activated by thrombin cleavage to fragment platelets. Platelet aggregates produced ex vivo with ADP or collagen and fibrinogen are destroyed by the C-terminal ADAMTS-18 fragment. Anti-ADAMTS-18 Ab shortens the tail vein bleeding time. The C-terminal fragment protects against FeCI3-induced carotid artery thrombosis as well as cerebral infarction in a postischemic stroke model. Thus, a new mechanism is proposed for platelet thrombus clearance, via platelet oxidative fragmentation induced by thrombin cleavage of ADAMTS-18.
