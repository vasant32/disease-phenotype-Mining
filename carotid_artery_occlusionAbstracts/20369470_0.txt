 OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective mechanism of BuYangHuanWu recipe on neurofunction in gerbils with cerebral ischemia- reperfusion. METHODS: Gerbils (n = 48) were divided randomly into three groups: animal model group, BuYangHuanWu recipe group, and sham control group. The animal model of cerebral ischemia was established using bilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by unclamp 45 min after occlusion. The microcirculation was observed with a Laser Doppler. The density of microvascular was measured using Tannic acid ferric chloride mordant dyeing. The BBB (blood brain barrier) permeability was assessed using evan's blue (EB) dye. The water content in brain tissues was tested with wet and dry method. The learning and memory function test was performed with a 4-PTT dry path maze. RESULTS: Compared with the animal model group, BuYangHuanWu recipe increased blood flow in the hippocampal region at 1 and 5 min after occlusion, inhibited hypoperfusion at 15 min after reperfusion, increased blood flow at 30, 60 and 120 min after reperfusion. Meanwhile, BuYangHuanWu recipe inhibited the increase of BBB permeability and water content in brain tissues after reperfusion (P < 0.05). BuYangHuanWu recipe also improved the scores of learning and memory function of the gerbils. CONCLUSION: BuYangHuanWu recipe protects the neurofunction in gerbils with ischemia-reperfusion through modulating cerebral microcirculation damages.
