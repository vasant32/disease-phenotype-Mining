We describe a seven-year-old girl with severe pneumonia probably associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae who developed right-sided hemiparalysis and right central facial paralysis soon after the onset of the disease. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed left corpus striatum acute infarction and magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated left internal carotid artery occlusion. She also had positive antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies and increased fibrinogen and D-dimer levels.
