We report a case of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. The patient was a 54-year-old man, who developed a small cerebral hemorrhage in the left internal capsule. He was admitted with mild right hemiparesis to out hospital. Left carotid angiography showed an occlusion at the origin of the internal carotid artery. Right cerebral angiography revealed the slow filling of cerebral arteries of left hemisphere by the cross flow. He was treated conservatively. Two days after admission, the neurological examination revealed no notable abnormalities. The etiology of hemorrhage of this case is presumed as the arterial necrosis due to hypertension. There has been no report on the intracerebral hemorrhage associated with ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Our case suggests that the volume and enlargement of cerebral hemorrhage may be influenced by cerebral perfusion pressure.
