The technique of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) that was introduced initially by Dotter and Judkins in 1964 has been applied to various arterial stenoses and some occlusive lesions and has advanced dramatically with the development of the Gr√ºntzig catheter in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. However, the application to occlusive disease in brachiocephalic arteries is still considered to be disputable and has been made only in selective cases, especially in Japan. We report here a case with stenosis of the left subclavian artery successfully treated with PTA. The patient was 66 year-old man, who had been suffering from transient attacks of vertigo, ataxia, visual disturbance and the left arm claudication. Blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg in the right arm and 110 mmHg in systole in the left arm. Diagnostic arteriography identified the right carotid artery occlusion at its origin and significant stenosis in the proximal left subclavian artery. PTA under fluoroscopic control was performed by passing dilating catheter in antegrade fashion by Seldinger method through the left femoral artery. Anatomic correction was achieved without hemorrhagic or embolic complications. Systolic blood pressure gradient measured at the brachial artery level disappeared immediately after PTA and symptomatic relief was obtained completely. One month later, wide patency of the left subclavian artery and sufficient antegrade flow in the vertebral artery were confirmed angiographically. During follow-up period of 4 months, the patient was asymptomatic. We reviewed the literature reporting PTA for occlusive disease in brachiocephalic arteries and discussed its problems and possibilities, especially for the treatment of subclavian artery stenosis.
