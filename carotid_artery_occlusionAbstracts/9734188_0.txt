The differentiation of pseudo-occlusion from complete internal carotid artery occlusion may have important clinical consequences for patients with the former tend not to benefit from reconstructive surgery. The Authors report a case in which color-Doppler duplex-scanner revealed a persisting string-like lumen that was not demonstrated by angiography. The Authors believe that ultrasonography may in future permit the reliable differentiation of pseudo-from complete carotid occlusion, thereby reducing the need for angiography.
