Regional extracellular release of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) was measured in gerbils (with or without pargyline pretreatment) subjected to bilateral carotid artery occlusion (15 min) and various periods of recirculation (up to 6 hr), utilizing intracerebral microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and in vitro stimulated lipid peroxidation (TBARM) were determined in separate experimental groups of animals. The ischemically induced DA release, decrease of MAO-derived DA metabolites DOPAC and HVA, and accumulation of 3-MT were potentiated and prolonged by pargyline pretreatment. Mitochondrial MAO and SOD activities were significantly reduced during ischemia alone and up to 1 hr of reperfusion, whereas TBARM was enhanced during reflow only. The data suggest that reduced activity of mitochondrial antioxidative enzyme(s) but not DA metabolism by MAO may contribute to free radical-mediated injury of (mitochondrial) membranes.
