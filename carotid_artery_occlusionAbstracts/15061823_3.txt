It remains controversial whether borderzone infarcts are due to compromised cerebral perfusion and whether territorial infarcts are caused by artery-to-artery emboli in case of occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The present positron emission tomography study compares with normal controls, the average regional cerebral bloodflow (rCBF), regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (rCMRO(2)) in the infarct area, the peri-infarct zone, the remaining homolateral hemisphere and in the contralateral hemisphere of 10 patients with borderzone and 17 patients with territorial infarcts, due to internal carotid artery occlusion by atherosclerosis and by cervical dissection. The steady-state technique with oxygen-15 was used. A nearly significant increase of rOEF with lowered rCBF and rCMRO(2) was observed in the peri-infarct zone of patients with territorial infarcts. In patients with borderzone infarcts rCMRO(2) was decreased in the peri-infarct zone, in the remaining homolateral hemisphere and in the contralateral hemisphere without changes in rCBF and rOEF. The present study finds no arguments that impaired cerebral perfusion is a more frequent cause of borderzone than of territorial infarcts.
