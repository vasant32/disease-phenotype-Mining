Accurate diagnosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is essential in the investigation of carotid disease yet may be difficult using Duplex. Traditionally contrast arteriography has been used to confirm the diagnosis despite its cost and potential dangers. Twenty-one patients with 23 ICA occlusions were evaluated by a 3-dimensional time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique. The cervical carotids and circle of Willis were imaged during the MRA examination which lasted 30 minutes. Confirmatory conventional angiography was performed in all patients. Using angiography as the gold standard, all occlusions were correctly diagnosed by MRA and 22 of 23 occlusions correctly diagnosed by Duplex. There was good agreement between MRA and angiography for all 42 ICAs imaged (Kappa statistic 0.83). Diagnosis of internal carotid artery occlusion is critical as it determines the need for operation. In this situation MRA provides a useful non-invasive complement to Duplex. A combination of non-invasive studies may enable arteriography to be rejected with greater confidence in this high risk group.
