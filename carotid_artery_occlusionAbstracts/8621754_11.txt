The role of endogenous endothelins in mediating postischaemic hypoperfusion after transient global ischaemia was investigated in halothane-anaesthetised rats. Pretreatment with the broad-spectrum (ET (A) and ET (B)) endothelin antagonist. Bosentan (17 micromol/kg) had minimal effect on postischaemic hypoperfusion, measured by hydrogen clearance, in the caudate nucleus and the parietal cortex in the 3 h after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with concomitant haemorrhagic hypotension (transient global ischaemia). In a separate series of rats with CBF measured by [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 90 min after carotid occlusion with concomitant haemorrhagic hypotension, Bosentan treatment failed to significantly alter CBF in any of the 35 brain regions examined. No significant alterations in CBF, measured by hydrogen clearance, were observed after transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. [14C]Iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 90 min after occlusion failed to demonstrate any significant increases in CBF after transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in any of the 35 brain regions examined in anaesthetised rats. The failure of the broad-spectrum endothelin antagonist Bosentan, at concentrations known to inhibit the cerebrovascular effects of exogenous ET-1, provide no support for the view that endothelins have a major role in mediating acute postischaemic hypoperfusion.
