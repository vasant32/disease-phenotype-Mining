We have collected four cases of supergiant cerebral aneurysm, each greater than 6.0 cm in diameter. Two of these cases were saccular aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery, of which the necks were clipped with resection of the aneurysms. Another patient had a fusiform aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery, which was resected accompanied by a reconstructive procedure of cerebral blood flow. The last patient had a fusiform aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Following internal carotid artery occlusion surgery with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis, the aneurysm completely disappeared radiologically within several months.
