Bypass grafting is considered the treatment of choice for occlusions of supraaortic vessels. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a well-established treatment for patients with subclavian stenosis, but its efficacy in total subclavian or innominate occlusions is so far not well established. Since 1995, we have carried out 9 PTA revascularizations in 9 patients with total symptomatic atherosclerotic occlusion of supraaortic vessels. The technical success rate was 100%, without any major (death or stroke) or minor complications. In the follow-up period (mean 37.4 months), 1 patient had a symptomatic left internal carotid artery occlusion and an asymptomatic occlusion of the treated subclavian artery. In expert hands, stenting-PTA should be considered as the primary therapeutic option.
