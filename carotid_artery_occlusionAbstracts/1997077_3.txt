Between 1979 and 1989, 133 carotid artery reconstructions were performed in 130 patients with contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion. These 133 reconstructions represent 7.3% of 1815 revascularizations of the internal carotid artery for atheromatous lesions performed during the same period. There were 113 men (87%) and 17 women (13%) whose mean age was 64.8 years (range 38 to 83 years). Forty-two patients (32%) had coronary artery disease and 77 (59%) were hypertensive. Nineteen patients (14%) were asymptomatic; 16 (12%) had symptoms of isolated vertebrobasilar insufficiency; 19 (14%) had ipsilateral carotid symptoms (on the side of operation); 67 (51%) had contralateral symptoms (on the side of occlusion); and 12 (9%) had bilateral carotid symptoms. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia without the use of a shunt. Nine patients (6.8%) died in the postoperative period (eight of neurologic and one of respiratory causes). Twelve patients (9%) sustained a cerebral vascular accident (eight ipsilateral and four contralateral). Four of these cerebral vascular accidents were diagnosed upon awakening, the remaining eight occurred after an initial uneventful recovery. Combined neurologic mortality and morbidity was 9.8%. Patients with occlusive lesions of the contralateral carotid artery undergoing internal carotid artery reconstruction are at high risk for postoperative cerebral vascular accidents. It is in this group of patients that the various methods of monitoring and cerebral protection should be evaluated.
