The effect of transient cerebral ischemia on cholinergic metabolism was investigated in adult and young gerbils subjected to bilateral carotid artery occlusion (15 min) alone or with release. Ischemia decreased brain acetylcholine (ACh) and increased choline (Ch) levels, affecting the young to a lesser degree than the adult gerbils. Blood recirculation induced a rapid early restoration of brain ACh levels in young animals, whereas a tremendous rebound of ACh was observed in the adults. After 2 h of reflow, Ch levels normalized in the adult brain, whereas a decreased choline level was seen in the young brain. This is the first study demonstrating an age-dependent susceptibility of cholinergic neurotransmission to cerebral ischemia.
