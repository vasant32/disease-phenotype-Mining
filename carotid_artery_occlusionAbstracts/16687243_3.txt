Effects of iloprost on visual evoked potentials and oxidant/antioxidant status were evaluated after bilateral carotid artery occlusion. There were three experimental groups; Sham (S) group (n=10), bilateral common carotid artery occluded (BCCAO) group (n=10) and after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, iloprost-treated (BCCAOI) group (n=10). Iloprost was administered (0.5ng/kg/day) for 10 days by intraperitoneal injection. N(2) and P(2) latencies (millisecond) and N(2)-P(2) (microV) amplitudes were recorded 10 days after operation for evaluating VEPs. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation immediately after recording of VEPs. Malondialdehyte (MDA), glutathione (GSH), Cu-Zn superoxide dysmutase (SOD) were studied spectrophotometricly. After BCCAO, MDA levels were increased, GSH and Cu-Zn SOD levels were decreased significantly, and abnormal VEPs parameters were observed. Iloprost treatment after BCCAO decreased MDA and increased GSH levels significantly. Low Cu-Zn SOD levels and impaired VEPs remained after iloprost treatment. Iloprost treatment may protect the brain tissue from oxidative damage during cerebral hypoperfusion.
