A case of a woman with neovascularization of the iris in the anterior segment of the right eye and symptoms of secondary glaucoma has been described. During the third day of her hospitalization the symptoms of the embolus of the central retinal artery appeared. The examination of her carotid arteries by means of Doppler's ultrasonography was used. The ultrasonography showed the occlusion of the internal carotid artery and the external one on the left side and the stenosis of the common carotid artery and the right internal one due to numerous thrombi. The patient was advised to have her carotid arteries operated on but she did not agree on the surgery. Now the right eye is blind. The non-invasive method of Doppler's ultrasonography enables a quicker diagnosis and gives efficient medical treatment before serious complications occur.
