We report a case of epidermal nevus syndrome involving the brain in which there is chronic occlusion of the left distal internal carotid artery resulting in ipsilateral atrophy. Orbital and cerebellopontine angle cistern lipomas and a wide cortical developmental malformation are associated with the condition. We present MR imaging findings of a patient and discuss features in the context of other neurocutaneous diseases.
