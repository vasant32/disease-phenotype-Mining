The effects of Fansidar on systemic arterial blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and carotid artery occlusion of anaesthetized cats have been investigated. Fansidar decreased the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures in a dose-related manner. The drug also reduced the left ventricular systolic pressure and heart rate in a similar fashion. Relatively moderate to high doses (greater than or equal to 0.4 ml/kg ml/kg i.e. 80 mg/kg sulfadoxine and 4 mg/kg pyrimethamine) of Fansidar decreased, but did not completely abolish the response due to carotid artery occlusion.
