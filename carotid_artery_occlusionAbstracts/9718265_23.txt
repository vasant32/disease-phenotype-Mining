To characterise the role played by dopamine receptors in ischaemic brain damage, we have evaluated the effects of pergolide, bromocriptine and lisuride (dopamine D2 receptor agonists), haloperidol (a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8,dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine (SKF 38393; a dopamine D1 receptor agonist) and (R)-(+)-8-chloro 2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin-7-ol (SCH 23390; a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist) in the gerbil model of global cerebral ischaemia. Ischaemia was induced by 5 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion under halothane anaesthesia. Sham operated animals were used as controls. Pergolide (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg i.p), bromocriptine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg i.p.), lisuride (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg i.p.), SCH 23390 (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg i.p.), haloperidol (0.5, 1.0 or 2 mg/kg i.p.) and SKF 38393 (1.0 or 2 mg/kg i.p.) were administered 1 h before occlusion. Five-minute-occluded animals had extensive damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 5 days after surgery. Pergolide 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p. provided significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) neuroprotection against the ischaemia-induced hippocampal damage. Bromocriptine and lisuride also provided significant (P < 0.05) neuroprotection, but only at the higher 1.0 mg/kg dose. In contrast, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (haloperidol), the dopamine D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) and the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390) failed to provide any neuroprotection in the model. These results support studies indicating that dopamine is important in ischaemic situations. The results also indicate that dopamine D2 receptor agonists are neuroprotective against ischaemia-induced brain injury and may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders.
