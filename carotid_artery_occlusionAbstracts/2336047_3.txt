Cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (15 min) with and without release (1 hr) served as a model for comparative regional studies of synaptosomal 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine (3H-5-HT) uptake and release in adult and young gerbils. A decreased uptake and an increased release of 5-HT was observed in the adult after ischemia alone and/or ischemia with reflow. At the same time, 5-HT uptake was not affected except in the cortex and the release was reduced in the young. These findings indicate that the same ischemic insults affect differently the synaptosomal uptake and/or release of 5-HT in adult and young brain.
