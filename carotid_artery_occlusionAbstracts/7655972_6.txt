OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of contralateral carotid stenosis on oxygen saturation (CsO2) of both cerebral hemispheres monitored by reflective near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during carotid surgery. METHODS: NIRS was compared to ipsilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery and jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (JvSO2) in 54 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. RESULTS: Median operated side and contralateral CsO2 were 68(54-88)% and 69(55-85)% before carotid clamping falling to 63(44-80)% and 69(55-84)% respectively on clamping the carotid (p < 0.0001 and p = NS). JvSO2 fell from 78(38-98)% to 72(30-97)% on carotid clamping with a percentage fall in peak TCD of -28(0 to -100)% (p < 0.0001). Patients with a contralateral carotid artery occlusion experienced falls in ipsi and contralateral CsO2 of -8(-4 to -10)% and -3(2 to -7)% compared to -4(0 to -14)% and 0(-5 to 4)% in those with a lesser stenosis (p < 0.05). On declamping, median ipsilateral and contralateral CsO2 rose from 65(46-82)% and 67(52-87)% to 68(53-84)% respectively (p < 0.0001 and p = NS). JvSO2 increased from 75(33-95)% to 79(42-95)% (p < 0.0001) with an increase in median peak TCD of 35(-34 to 506)%. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest changes in CsO2 occurred in the operated side cerebral hemispheres in those with a contralateral carotid artery occlusion. However, a contralateral carotid artery occlusion does not reliably predict the need for a shunt and cerebral monitoring remains essential; although is only required on the operated side.
