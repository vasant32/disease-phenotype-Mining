Several of the cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid were measured in the cerebral hemispheres of gerbils subjected to transient interruption of the cerebral circulation. The levels of PGD2, PGF2 alpha, PGE2, TXB2, 13, 14-H2-15-keto-PGE2, and the stable nonenzymic product of prostacyclin, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, were not altered at the end of a 5-min period of ischemia. However, the onset of reperfusion was accompanied by a rapid accumulation of these products. Levels were highest during the initial period of reperfusion, then decreased to approach control levels after 120 min. PGD2, PGF2 alpha, and PGE2 were the predominant metabolites detected. This postischemic accumulation of arachidonic acid metabolites could be blocked by prior administration of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity.
