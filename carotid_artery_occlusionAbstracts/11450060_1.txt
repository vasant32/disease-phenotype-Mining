We have examined the regional differences in the evolution of energy failure in experimental focal cerebral ischemia. In gerbil brain subjected to repeated unilateral common carotid artery occlusion, the tissue ATP content, pH and succinic dehydrogenase activity decreased at different rates after the circulation had been restored in various cerebral regions. Light microscopical infarction became apparent at different rates following the impairment of the energy metabolism in these regions. In brain cortex with selective neuronal necrosis, only minor alterations in energy metabolism were detectable over a 7-day period following the restoration of the circulation. The present data show that the rate of energy failure is significantly different in various cerebral regions after repeated periods of cerebral ischemia in the gerbil. A slowly evolving impairment of the cerebral energy metabolism after circulation of the brain has been restored appears to be indispensable for the delayed formation of infarction after transient cerebral ischemia.
