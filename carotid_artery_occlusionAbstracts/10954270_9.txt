BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our purpose was to show changes in the diameter of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by using high-resolution MR imaging in patients with chronic internal carotid artery occlusion after IV administered acetazolamide challenge. Changes in blood flow velocity of the basal cerebral arteries are thought to correlate with changes of cerebral blood flow. Changes in the diameter of the basal cerebral arteries, however, might influence the validity of transcranial Doppler measurements. METHODS: Eight patients with internal carotid artery occlusion who were undergoing acetazolamide testing for assessment of cerebrovascular vasomotor reactivity were included in the study. Blood flow velocities of both MCAs were measured with transcranial Doppler sonography before and 25 minutes after the administration of acetazolamide. Before and 15 minutes after the administration of medication, MR imaging was performed contralateral to the occlusion side. A T2-weighted turbo-gradient spin-echo sequence was chosen to show a cross section of the M1 segment in high resolution (pixels, 0.27 x 0.29 mm). Based on interpolated data, the smallest and greatest MCA diameters were determined. RESULTS: We did not find changes in the diameter of the MCA after acetazolamide provocation testing with high-resolution MR imaging in patients with occlusive extracranial carotid artery disease. CONCLUSION: The results of our study support the hypothesis that changes in MCA flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler sonography reflect relative changes in cerebral blood flow after acetazolamide provocation testing.
