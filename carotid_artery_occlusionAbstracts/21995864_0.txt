Involvement of the glutathione system is well established in stroke-induced memory dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of celecoxib (a selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor), nimesulide (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor), and ibuprofen (a nonselective COX-2 inhibitor) against bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO)-induced memory dysfunction. BCCAO for 30 minutews, followed by 24-hour reperfusion, significantly delayed transfer latency in the plus-maze performance task and shortened fall-off time in the hanging-wire experimental test. Besides significant alterations in glutathione defense (i.e., glutathione S-transferase and redox ratio), increased acetylcholinesterase activity and proinflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α) in the hippocampus was seen. Seven days of treatment with celecoxib (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), nimesulide (10 mg/kg, p.o.), and ibuprofen (30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly improved behavioral alterations and glutathione defense and attenuated acetylcholinesterase activity and TNF-α levels, as compared to the control (i.e., ischemic reperfusion) group. The present study highlights the neuroprotective effect of celecoxib and nimesulide against ischemia reperfusion injury-induced memory dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative damage.
