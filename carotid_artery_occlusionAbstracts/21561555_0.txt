Collateral networks between the external carotid artery and internal carotid arteries become crucial for cerebral perfusion after occlusion of internal carotid arteries. We report the first case of a patient who received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in a collateral vessel between the external and internal carotid artery for treatment of radiation induced severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery in the context of a contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion.
