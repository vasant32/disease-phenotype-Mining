BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy is usually delayed for 2 months following an acute stroke, but the stroke may progress or a further stroke may occur. A randomized pilot study of urgent carotid surgery for acute stroke was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a definitive multicentre trial. METHODS: Seven Manchester hospitals referred patients with acute stroke (less than 7 days previously), defined according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification The carotid arteries were examined by portable continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography. Patients with more than 50 per cent carotid stenosis on portable Doppler ultrasonography underwent colour duplex Doppler imaging. Patients with more than 70-99 per cent carotid stenosis were randomized to urgent carotid surgery or best medical care. RESULTS: A total of 593 patients were assessed over 2 years. Of these, 414 had acute stroke, of whom 380 had probable cerebral infarction. Complete ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion was most common in patients with total anterior circulation infarcts (33 (28 per cent) of 117), whereas severe ipsilateral (70-99 per cent) stenosis was most common in partial anterior circulation infarcts (25 (20 per cent) of 128). Only 16 patients (one total and 15 partial anterior circulation infarcts) were fit enough for surgery and consented to randomization. CONCLUSION: A definitive trial of urgent carotid surgery would need to screen large numbers of patients but could focus on patients with partial anterior circulation infarcts.
