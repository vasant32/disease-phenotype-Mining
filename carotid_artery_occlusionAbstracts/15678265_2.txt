A 25-year-old male patient in whom occlusion of the internal carotid artery developed secondary to a skull base fracture is presented. The diagnosis of internal carotid artery occlusion was reached 12 hours after the admission and 17 hours after the injury. The patient was initially treated for ischemic edema and when the patient showed signs of cerebral herniation, decompressive craniectomy was necessary. The outcome was good. The clinical and radiologic characteristics of internal carotid artery occlusion in closed head injury are highlighted and treatment options are reviewed in light of pertinent literature.
