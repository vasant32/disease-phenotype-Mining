A 45-year-old woman presented with progressive stroke due to occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at the level of the cavernous portion (C3/C4). Revascularization was achieved by stent deployment following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Stent thrombosis occurred 7 days after primary stenting; it was successfully treated with the stent-in-stent technique. The patient was able to return to her independent life with no sequelae except for slight hemiparesis. In combination with appropriate antiplatelet treatment, the stent-in-stent technique should be considered as a rescue option in patients with re-occlusion of an intracranial stent.
