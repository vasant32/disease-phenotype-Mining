A 27-year-old man was admitted to our institution with the sudden development of right hemiparesis and dysarthria beginning an hour after the onset of symptoms on August 9, 1992. The patient was found on admission to have right hemiparesis (2/5), hemihypesthesia, hemianopia, dysarthria; he had transient atrial fibrillation. No abnormalities were detected on computed tomography (CT) scans, and cerebral blood flow studies undertaken following conventional CT scans revealed no low flow regions in the left cerebral hemisphere. But cerebral angiography disclosed an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery with well-developed cross-circulation via the anterior communicating artery and embolus lodged at the level of the anterior choroidal artery. Superselective fibrinolysis using Tracker-18 and 420,000 units of urokinase resulting in complete recanalization of the left anterior choroidal artery without distal migration of the embolus. Immediately after the procedure, his neurologic disturbance underwent complete resolution. In summary, fibrinolysis could be performed but limited to anterior choroidal artery in a case with an occlusion of the internal carotid artery with well-developed cross-flow via the anterior communicating artery; the patient's neurologic condition may deteriorate suddenly if fibrinolysis is incomplete and the embolus migrates to the internal carotid artery.
