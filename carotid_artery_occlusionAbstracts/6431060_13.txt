The authors report a case of pituitary apoplexy resulting in bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion, with marked depression of consciousness and hemiplegia. After transsphenoidal tumor decompression, restoration of flow in both carotid arteries was documented angiographically and the patient made an excellent clinical recovery. The unique aspect of this case is that the pituitary apoplexy was apparently precipitated by neuroendocrine manipulation, performed as a preoperative test of pituitary function.
