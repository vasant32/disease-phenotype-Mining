It is difficult to predict the adequacy of the collateral blood flow in patients who undergo internal carotid artery occlusion. In order to address this difficulty, the authors have created a computer model of the cerebral circulation. This model features individualized simulations of the Circle of Willis and its afferent and efferent branches which can predict changes in flow that will occur during internal carotid artery occlusion. Analysis of the flow predictions suggests that in patients with a symmetric Circle of Willis the anterior communicating artery is the major conduit of collateral blood supply. In patients with a small anterior communicating artery, the posterior communicating arteries become more important as sources of collateral flow, but they cannot supply as much flow as in the case of a normal anterior communicating artery. Sensitivity studies show that changes in the dimensions of each artery affect the flow throughout the system, such that the arteries in the cerebral circulation must be analyzed as a network rather than as isolated elements. This computer model of the cerebral circulation may help clinicians predict the adequacy of collateral blood supply in patients who undergo internal carotid artery occlusion.
