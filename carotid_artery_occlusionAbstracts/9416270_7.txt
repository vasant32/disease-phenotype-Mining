This study examines whether during bilateral carotid artery occlusion in Fischer 344 rats, hyperglycemia induces cerebrovascular changes that enhance brain edema formation. Preischemic hyperglycemia was induced by intraperitoneal administration of D-glucose solution. Laser-Doppler flowmetry, indicated that after the initial decline in blood flow with carotid occlusion (36 +/- 4% of preischemic), hyperglycemic but not control rats showed a further progressive decrease to 19 +/- 2% of preischemic at 120 minutes (p < 0.001). Brain water content was significantly higher in hypercompared to normoglycemic rats after both 2 hours of permanent occlusion (3.86 +/- 0.05 vs. 3.73 +/- 0.03 g/g dry wt.; p < 0.05) and 2 hours of temporary occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion (4.01 +/- 0.08 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.03 g/g dry wt.; p < 0.05). The difference in brain edema formation between normo- and hyperglycemic rats appears to primarily reflect the effects of hyperglycemia on CBF. Cerebral plasma volume (CPV) 2 hours after occlusion was also reduced in hyper-compared to normoglycemic rats (3.9 +/- 0.9 and 7.2 +/- 0.1 microliters/g; p < 0.01). Thus, hyperglycemia in a model of global ischemia induces a reduction in CPV and progressive decline in CBF. In this model, the decline in CBF is of sufficient magnitude to enhance brain injury as evidenced by edema formation.
