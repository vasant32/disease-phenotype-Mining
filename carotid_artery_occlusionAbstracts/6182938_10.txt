1 Baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex activity was studied in anaesthetized adult rats which had been treated neonatally with a single injection of capsaicin (50 mg/kg s.c.). 2 Pressor responses to bilateral carotid artery occlusion were significantly lower in capsaicin-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated controls. Pressor responses to intravenously injected noradrenaline were similar in the two groups of rats. 3 Resting respiratory minute volume and tidal volume were lower in anaesthetized capsaicin-treated animals than in vehicle-treated controls, but there was no significant difference in respiratory frequency. 4 The increases in respiration evoked by intravenous administration of the peripheral arterial chemoreceptor stimulant, sodium cyanide, or by breathing a hypoxic gas mixture, were significantly lower in capsaicin-treated rats compared with the controls. 5 It is concluded that baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex activity are significantly reduced in anaesthetized adult rats which had been treated neonatally with capsaicin, and that this is likely to result from the destruction of unmyelinated baro- and chemoreceptor afferent fibres.
