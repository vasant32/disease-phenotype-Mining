Gerbils were subjected to bilateral carotid artery occlusion for either 15 or 20 min. After ischemia the animals were injected i.p. with oligo-prostaglandin B (oligo-PGB; trimer of 16,16'-dimethyl-15-dehydro-prostaglandin B1) dissolved in 4% sodium-bicarbonate, or with the vehicle. The dosing regimen of oligo-PGB was 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 mg/kg injected 5 min postischemia, or 1 mg/kg injected 30, 60, 90, 120 min after ischemia, or 10 mg/kg injected 5 min and 24 h postischemia. Behaviour of the animals and their mortality were studied for 14 days after ischemia. Administration of the drug did not affect recovery of the electrical activity in the brain and did not reduce the number of postischemic seizures. Following 15 min ischemia, administration of oligo-PGB resulted in statistically valid improvement of survival (P less than 0.04 or better) in all treatment groups. After 20 min ischemia only the double injection (10 mg/kg at 5 min and 24 h postischemia) resulted in a substantial survival improvement (64%, P less than 0.005). The mechanism of the drug action is unknown but, based on the available data, the authors believe it to be related to the modification of arachidonic acid metabolism in the late postischemic period.
