Management of the internal carotid artery in skull-base surgery can be a difficult problem when disease involves this vessel or resection is anatomically limited by it. The recent radiologic development of the detachable balloon catheter has permitted occlusion of the internal carotid artery in a controlled setting prior to any surgical procedure. An obvious prerequisite to using this technique is the demonstration of adequate collateral blood flow to the brain. Patients are evaluated with arteriography and temporary arterial balloon occlusion while monitoring physical signs and electroencephalography (EEG). Although usually performed preoperatively, internal carotid artery occlusion is needed intraoperatively on occasion. This essential adjuvant technique for the skull-base surgeon will be detailed along with its indications and limitations in 24 patients.
