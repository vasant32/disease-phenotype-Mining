Brain damage after stroke and head injury remains a huge clinical problem. In stroke, the initial cause of the damage is a blockage in a blood vessel (often the middle cerebral artery) and this sets off several pathways that ultimately lead to cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that several new mechanisms are involved in neuronal death and this has led to an increase in research into novel molecules that might prevent brain damage or improve recuperation post-stroke. There are several models of global cerebral ischemia. Two of the most widely-used models are discussed in detail in UNIT 9.5, the gerbil bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) model and rat 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model. Additionally, several models of focal cerebral ischemia have been developed to mimic the effects of human stroke. The rationale behind the use of animal models, the various types of models and advantage and disadvantages of each model are presented.
