Proximal occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is still the treatment of choice for a large cavernous sinus aneurysm. Endovascular occlusion or trapping of the ICA with or without an extracranial-intracranial bypass is sometimes performed. We analyzed the results of the long-term follow up of 11 patients with a giant or large cavernous sinus aneurysm treated by only proximal occlusion between 1975 and 1989. Proximal occlusion of the carotid artery was performed by Selverstone clamping. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 21 years (mean 13.9 years). Eight of the 11 patients showed improvement of cranial nerves paresis or headache, and four became asymptomatic. None of the original aneurysms ruptured. The final outcomes were nine good recovery, one moderately disabled, and one severely disabled by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The causes of morbidity were early ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage from a newly formed aneurysm. Late complications included ischemia in two patients, and new formation and enlargement of aneurysms at a site other than the original aneurysm in two patients, 13 and 17 years later. Therapeutic carotid artery occlusion requires strict test ICA occlusion. In addition, long-term follow up by periodical cerebral angiography using magnetic resonance, computed tomography, or digital subtraction angiography is necessary, and postoperative medical treatment is important to reduce the risk of late complications.
