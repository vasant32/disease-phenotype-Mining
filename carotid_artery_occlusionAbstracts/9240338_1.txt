Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass grafting procedures were specially designed for treatment of bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. When performed in an expeditious manner, EC-IC bypass procedures have produced effective and durable results, despite the recent disfavor given to this procedure. This communication reports a 68-year-old white man who developed generalized cerebral ischemia manifested as confusion, incoherence, disorientation, ataxia, and numerous episodes of syncope daily. A cerebral angiogram revealed bilateral external carotid arteries and left solitary vertebral artery critical stenosis. Transcranial Doppler study demonstrated reduction of cerebral and vertebral-basilar perfusion. However, the patient's EC-IC bypass graft had remained patent since 1985. The patient's recurrent symptoms of global ischemia and syncope resolved after carotid endarterectomy, vein patch external carotid artery, and vertebral-to-common carotid artery transposition. This report reiterates the value of the EC-IC bypass procedure and presents the surgical management of symptomatic external carotid and vertebral artery stenosis in patients after EC-IC bypass procedures.
