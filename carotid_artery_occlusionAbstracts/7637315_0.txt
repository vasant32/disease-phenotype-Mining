The authors presented results of visual system examination in 28 persons in whom disturbances of blood flow in carotid arteries were diagnosed with colour doppler ultrasonography. The patients underwent routine ophthalmological examination, including kinetic and static perimetry. Ocular signs only, with no neurological changes, were found in 46% of patients. In 21% of cases there were episodes of transient blindness; homonymous hemianopsia occurred in 10%, acute ischaemic optic neuropathy in 11%, and secondary neovascular glaucoma in 14% of patients.
