Ischemic-reperfusion injury in humans occurs in conditions such as stroke, cardiac arrest, subarachnoid hemorrhage or head trauma. Maximal tissue damage is observed during reperfusion, which is primarily attributed to oxidative injury resulting from production of oxygen free radicals. One of the major consequences of such damage is the depletion of the cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) leading to oxidation of protein thiols to disulfides and the loss of activity of critical enzymes having active thiol group(s). Thus, the maintenance of thiol homeostasis is an important factor in cell survival. The effect of thiol antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid and the isopropyl ester of GSH was examined on the morbidity and mortality of rats subjected to reperfusion following cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypotension. While the GSH isopropyl ester had no significant protective effect; after pretreatment of rats, alpha-lipoic acid was detected in the rat brain and it dramatically reduced the mortality rate from 78% to 26% during 24 h of reperfusion. The natural thiol antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid is effective in improving survival and protecting the rat brain against reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia.
