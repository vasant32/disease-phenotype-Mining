Bilateral carotid artery occlusion results in an increase in mean arterial pressure, an increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity, and a redistribution of renal blood flow from inner to outer cortex. To elucidate the mechanism of the renal blood flow redistribution, carotid artery occlusion was performed in anesthetized dogs with the left kidney either having renal perfusion pressure maintained constant (aortic constriction) or having alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade (phenoxybenzamine); the right kidney of the same dog served to document the normal response. When renal perfusion pressure was maintained constant, renal blood flow distribution (microspheres) was unchanged by carotid artery occlusion. In the presence of renal alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, carotid artery occlusion elicited the usual redistribution of renal blood flow from inner to outer cortex. The redistribution of renal blood flow observed after carotid artery occlusion is mediated by the increase in renal perfusion pressure rather than the increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity.
