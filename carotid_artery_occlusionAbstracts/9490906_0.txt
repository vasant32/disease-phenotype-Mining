We report a 68-year-old male patient with right hemiparesis caused by cervical spinal cord infarction. Cerebral angiography revealed right internal carotid artery occlusion. The blood flow of right middle cerebral artery was fed by the basilar artery via right posterior communicating artery. In this case, the upper cervical spinal cord infarction might be induced by steal phenomenon of anterior spinal artery to the middle cerebral artery via posterior communicating artery in addition to the local ischemia by cervical spondylosis.
