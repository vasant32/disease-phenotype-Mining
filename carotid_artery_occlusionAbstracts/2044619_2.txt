When blood flow through the internal and external carotid arteries is completely interrupted by ipsilateral common carotid artery occlusion, the arterial orbital circulation may be more compromised than the brain supply. We studied a pure and extreme example of this situation in a patient who presented with acute orbital infarction, but no cerebral ischemia on clinical, CT and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) grounds. Ipsilateral blindness corresponded to retinal, choroidal and optic nerve infarction. The pattern of ophthalmoplegia, with relative sparing of adduction, was more compatible with a muscle than a nerve dysfunction, but a reactive dilated pupil, corneal anesthesia, and orbital pain suggested that the intraorbital branches of the ocular motor nerves and ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve were not spared. In addition, signs of widespread ocular ischemia were present. Sequential examinations documented the evolution pattern over 1 year. The absence of an orbital collateral supply from the contralateral external carotid and muscular cervical arteries systems, which contrasted with an adequate middle cerebral artery supply via the contralateral internal carotid artery, may explain this isolated and complete form of orbital ischemia due to common carotid artery occlusion.
