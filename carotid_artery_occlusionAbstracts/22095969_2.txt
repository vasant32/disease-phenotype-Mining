 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our research focuses on interventional neuroradiology (stroke treatment including imaging methods) and general neuroimaging with an emphasis on functional MR imaging. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of revascularization (TIMI) of middle cerebral and/or carotid artery occlusion by means of mechanical recanalization techniques and to evaluate the impact of collateralization, mismatch in perfusion CT, time to revascularization, grade of revascularization on tissue, and clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic  stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with MCA and/or ICA occlusion were included. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed by NECT, CTA, and volume PCT for grading collateralization and mismatch. Time to recanalization was measured from the onset of stroke to the time point of DSA-proved mechanical recanalization. Tissue outcome was calculated by segmentation of infarct size between pre- and postinterventional CT and percentage mismatch lost. Clinical outcome was determined by the  mRS. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 31 patients (61.8%) presented with MCA and 10/31 patients (38.2%), with distal ICA occlusions. Sufficient recanalization (TIMI 2 and 3) was achieved in 23/31 (75%). Clinical evaluation revealed an mRS score of â‰¤2 in 25.5%. Age (r = 0.439, P = .038) and TIMI (r = 0.544, P = .002) showed the strongest correlation with clinical outcome. Time to recanalization, TIMI score, and mismatch were associated with a good tissue outcome in  ANOVA. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcome after mechanical recanalization of acute MCA and ICA occlusion depends on time to and grade of recanalization, mismatch, and collateralization. These results indicate that multimodal stroke imaging is helpful to guide therapy decisions and to indicate patients amenable for mechanical  recanalization.
