We investigated the effect of beraprost sodium (BPS), a new prostacyclin analog, on behavioral and neuropathological changes induced by a 10-min occlusion of the left carotid artery in gerbils. Gerbils were treated orally with BPS (1-100 micrograms/kg) 30 min before occlusion. Pathological evaluation of neural damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was performed 7 d after the ischemic insults. In the symptomatic group, in which the stroke index score was > 10, symptomatic behaviors, such as head cocked, splayed out hind limb, circling, and various similar behaviors, were observed. Pathologically, almost all CA1 neurons were destroyed 7 d after ischemia in the symptomatic group. BPS improved the stroke index during ischemia and neuropathological changes 7 d later, with statistical significant improvement occurring at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg.
