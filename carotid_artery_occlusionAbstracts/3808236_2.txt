We present a patient with internal carotid artery occlusion and ischemic oculopathy in whom extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass improved vision. Visual evoked potentials were studied to obtain objective criteria for indication and follow-up evaluation and confirmed that the improved vision was due to improved retinal function.
