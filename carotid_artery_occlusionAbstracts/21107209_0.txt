 BACKGROUND: Extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery provides blood flow augmentation in patients suffering from intracranial or long-distance conductance artery stenosis or occlusion that otherwise cannot be treated. The standard procedure for these cases is an anastomosis between the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries. However, in patients presenting with common carotid artery occlusion, the superficial temporal artery is no longer sufficiently perfused. For these patients, alternative revascularization strategies have to be applied. OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel strategy for revascularization of patients with common carotid artery occlusion, ie, the extracranial posterior communicating artery bypass. METHODS: Two patients with chronic cerebrovascular compromise resulting in transitory ischemic attacks and/or border-zone infarctions caused by common carotid artery occlusion were referred to our institution. A radial artery bypass was established between the third segment of the vertebral artery and an M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery. The vertebral artery was exposed between the vertebral lamina of C1 and occipital bone via a paramedian incision. The bypass was tunneled subcutaneously, conducted intracranially via a tailored extended burr-hole craniotomy, and anastomosed to a recipient M3 vessel. RESULTS: The postoperative course of both patients was uneventful in terms of cerebral ischemia or bleeding complications. In both patients, postoperative angiographic controls revealed an excellent bypass function with markedly improved hemispheric filling of multiple middle cerebral artery branches. The patients were discharged without new neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our extracranial posterior communicating artery bypass using a radial artery transplant from the vertebral artery to the middle cerebral artery is a useful tool to treat patients suffering from hemodynamic cerebrovascular compromise caused by common carotid artery occlusion.
