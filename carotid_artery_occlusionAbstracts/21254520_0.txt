The authors report results of reconstructive surgery in 316 patients with carotid artery (CA) occlusion operated after ischemic stroke. Its efficiency is estimated with reference to the degree of neurologic deficiency and treatment schedule. The results confirm effectiveness of reconstructive surgery on CA for the prevention of stroke relapses and promotion of surgical rehabilitation.
