BACKGROUND: Parent artery occlusion is one of the traditional methods of treatment for unclippable aneurysms. However, parent artery occlusion may not result in permanent exclusion of the aneurysm from the systemic circulation. We present a case of cerebral aneurysm treated by proximal embolization of the parent artery, which recanalized during the follow-up period. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with a right blepharoptosis and diplopia. A large aneurysm arising from the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery was found and endovascularly excluded from the cerebral circulation by proximal internal carotid artery occlusion with balloons. Eleven days after treatment, occlusion of the parent artery and obliteration of the aneurysm were angiographically confirmed. However, the parent artery was found to be recanalized with nearly total obliteration of the aneurysm at the follow-up 6 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Angiography suggested that recanalization took place through the vaso vasorum. We believe that recanalization was induced by marginal cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral hemisphere.
