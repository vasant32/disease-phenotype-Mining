We report on two peculiar cases of intracranial hemorrhage due to the rupture of moyamoya disease-like vessels associated with unilateral internal carotid occlusion at its origin. The first case is 44-year-old male showing intraventricular hemorrhage associated with right internal carotid occlusion. The second case is 58-year-old female presenting sub-arachnoid hemorrhage associated with left internal carotid occlusion. Although both cases showed the unique appearance of collateral flow resembling moyamoya disease, they were not classified as moyamoya disease nor unilateral Moyamoya-like state. Vascular abnormality such as cerebral aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation were not at all detected. The etiology of hemorrhage for both cases is presumed as the rupture of moyamoya disease-like vessels, however, it is unable for us to determine why the one case showed IVH, yet the other showed SAH. The two cases showed hypoperfusion of ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere on SPECT that followed by the external-internal carotid revascularization surgery in the chronic stage. Post operative study proved the improvement of the CBF reserve. Nevertheless, whether the reconstructive vascularization prevent an occurrence of rebleeding needs the longer observation and the accumulation of the resembling cases.
