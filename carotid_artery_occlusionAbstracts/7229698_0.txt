Ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG), a semiautomated form of suction ophthalmodynamometry, was used to evaluate and follow 15 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy and two patients in whom gradual carotid artery occlusion was performed for inoperable intracranial aneurysm. Postoperative corrected ophthalmic arterial pressures (COAP's) on the operated side in the carotid endarterectomy patients averaged 12.5 mm Hg higher than before surgery, the standard deviation being 4.9 mm Hg for clinically stable patients. There was no significant change in COAP on the contralateral side. Several problems were encountered in closing down carotid clamps, the most potentially serious being a precipitous fall in COAP with the final adjustment. The current uses of OPG and similar techniques are reviewed, and potential neurosurgical applications are discussed.
