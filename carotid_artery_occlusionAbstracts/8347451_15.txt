A technique for remotely controlling the degree of carotid artery occlusion in the gerbil model of cerebral ischaemia has been developed. The technique relies on manually adjustable nylon snares around the carotid arteries, in conjunction with a computer-based monitoring system, to control the degree of occlusion. This has allowed us to determine the dependence of energy metabolism (as assessed by 31P NMR spectroscopy) on blood flow in greater detail than was possible in our previous studies. Data obtained show that energy changes first appear at flows of 25-30 mL/100 g/min, while at flows below 20 mL/100 g/min there is a major derangement of energy metabolism. The model was used to determine the sensitivity of cerebral energy metabolism to reduced cerebral blood flow under normothermic conditions and in mild hypothermia (30 degrees C). Hypothermia had a protective effect in that energy metabolites were maintained at flows significantly below the normothermic threshold.
