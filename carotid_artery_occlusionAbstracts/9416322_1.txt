The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of ischemic cytotoxic edema was investigated by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity with N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NLA). Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (15 min) alone or with release (15 and 60 min) served as a model for edema induction. NLA, N omega-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME) or Ringer's solution were administered 4 hr prior to ischemia or sham operation. Treatment with a stable nitroxide radical, 4-hydroxy-2,2, 6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-L-oxyl (TPL), was used to assess free radical involvement in edema. Accumulation of tissue water was evaluated by measuring specific gravity (SG) of brain cortex and histological examination. There was a greater reduction of cortical SG in early reperfusion (15 min) and a lesser decrease in SG (60 min later) in NLA-than in D-NAME- or Ringer's-treated gerbils. The NLA effect was confirmed by histological examination of the brain tissue. TPL treatment (pre- and postischemic) ameliorated the formation of edema to the same degree as NLA. The findings indicate a biphasic NLA modulation of cytotoxic edema most likely mediated through absence or presence of NO-derived free radicals.
