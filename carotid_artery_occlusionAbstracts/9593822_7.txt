The objective of this study was to determine whether the duration of an ischemic insult effects the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in relation to the recovery of metabolites and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) immediately after ischemia and during reperfusion in gerbil cortex. Cerebral ischemia was induced, using the bilateral carotid artery occlusion method, for 20 or 60 min, followed by reperfusion up to 120 min. Immediately after ischemia PDH activity increased threefold regardless of ischemic duration. In the 60-min ischemic group, PDH remained activated, the recovery of high energy phosphates and the clearance of lactate were poor, and the rCBF was 48% of controls after 20-min reperfusion, decreasing gradually to 26% at 120-min reperfusion. In the 20-min ischemic group, PDH activity normalized quickly, the restoration of energy phosphates was good, there was a quick reduction in lactate within the first 60 min of reperfusion, and the rCBF was 65% of control at 20-min reperfusion, and remained over 48% of control throughout reperfusion. Recovery of metabolism after reperfusion did not parallel the changes in rCBF in either group, most noticeably in the 60-min ischemic group. The slow normalization of PDH activity reflected the poor recovery of metabolites in the 60-min ischemic group, indicating that PDH activity is important in the resynthesis of energy metabolites during reperfusion. In conclusion, prolonging the ischemic insult effected PDH activity during reperfusion, impaired recovery of energy metabolites, and worsened the recovery of rCBF.
