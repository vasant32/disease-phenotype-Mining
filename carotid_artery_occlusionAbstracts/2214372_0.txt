The effects of antihypertensive drugs on ischemic cerebral damage were investigated using the bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) model in SHR. Oral budralazine and nifedipine, at doses that increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in SHR in our previous study (Tanaka, S. et al., Folia Pharmacol, Japan, 87, 1986), significantly improved cerebral energy failure after the BCAO, but prazosin which does not increase CBF had no effect on the energy failure. These results suggest that the amelioration by these antihypertensive drugs of the energy failure after the BCAO results from its CBF-increasing effects in SHR.
