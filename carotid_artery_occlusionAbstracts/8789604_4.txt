In order to investigate changes in levels of monoamines and their related substances together with those of other neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and GABA), choline and substances related to energy metabolism (ATP, lactate and glucose) accompanying incomplete cerebral ischemia, a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was utilized. Animals were subjected to 1 or 2 h ischemia. Then the concentrations of substances were measured in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum and compared with control values. Due to the incomplete ischemia, ATP showed a moderate decrease, while lactate and choline increased remarkably, and GABA underwent a moderate increase. With regard to monoamines, both noradrenaline and serotonin levels were reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, whereas dopamine levels increased in the hippocampus. All monoamine metabolites, i.e. metabolites by monoamine oxidase (MAO), metabolites by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and metabolites by both MAO and COMT, underwent increases. The 3-methoxytyramine level in particular showed marked increases. Furthermore levels of precursor amino acids as well as 5-hydroxytryptophan rose. Acetylcholine decreased moderately only in the cerebral cortex. Among these changes, sustained increases in all the monoamine metabolites were characteristic of changes in the incompletely ischemic brain, suggesting that both COMT and MAO retain their activities in the incompletely ischemic brain.
