The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the perioperative hazards and late results of internal carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with and without contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion. From March 1980 to April 1990, 375 consecutive patients underwent 439 CEAs at the First Department of Vascular Surgery of Padova Medical School. Patients were divided into two groups; group 1 (61 patients) had contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion and group 2 (314 patients) did not (378 CEAs, 64 bilateral). Indications for CEA were similar in both groups. The only significant difference in patient characteristics was a higher rate of previous stroke in group 1 (11% vs. 3%, p < 0.001). General anesthesia, continuous EEG monitoring, selective intraluminal shunt, and arteriotomy closure with a polytetrafluoroethylene patch (PTFE) were used routinely in both groups. An intraluminal shunt was inserted more frequently in group 1 than in group 2 (69% vs. 17%, p < 0.001). Major perioperative stroke occurred in one patient in each group (1.7% vs. 0.31%, respectively; NS). Early fatal stroke rates were 0% and 0.95% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (NS). All patients had neurologic examinations and duplex scans every 6 months (range 6 to 118 months; mean 42 months). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were virtually identical in the two groups; the majority of deaths were caused by myocardial infarction and cancer. There were no stroke-related deaths in group 1 as compared with 8.2% in group 2 (NS). New neurologic symptoms appeared in 4.7% of patients in group 1 and 6% in group 2 (NS) whereas the late stroke rates were 0% and 3.1%, respectively (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
