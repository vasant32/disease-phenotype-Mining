A rare case of a carotid body tumor that completely occluded the internal carotid artery is presented. To our knowledge this is only the second such case documented by angiography. In the present computed tomography era, the role of vascular imaging in these tumors is discussed and the varied clinical presentations of these neoplasms are reviewed. The confusion between the locally malignant behavior of some of these lesions and the accepted definition of a malignant carotid body tumor is discussed.
