We studied the effects of insulin with and without food deprivation on experimental cerebral ischemia in 197 gerbils. Ischemia was induced by unilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 4 hours. Gerbils were divided into four experimental groups and were studied for up to 1 week of survival: Group A (n = 50) was fed but received no insulin, Group B (n = 50) was deprived of food for 24 hours before surgery but received no insulin, Group C (n = 49) was fed and received daily injections of 0.1 IU lente insulin for 3 days before surgery, and Group D (n = 48) was deprived of food and received daily insulin injections. Insulin treatment was continued in Groups C and D after surgery. Blood glucose levels of all gerbils were determined before treatment (overall mean +/- SEM 88.0 +/- 12.4 mg/dl) and before carotid artery occlusion (Group A 92.2 +/- 18.3 mg/dl, Group B 81.4 +/- 11.7 mg/dl [p less than 0.05 different from before treatment], Group C 92.8 +/- 22.3 mg/dl, and Group D 66.1 +/- 24.0 mg/dl [p less than 0.001 different from before treatment]). Among the four groups, 52 gerbils died within 1 week. Neurologic deficits were scored and histologic evidence of the infarcts was graded in survivors at 1 week. Group C gerbils had the best stroke index scores. Histologic evaluation revealed that 35.9% of Group A, 21.1% of Group B, 13.9% of Group C (p less than 0.05 compared with Group A), and 28.1% of Group D survivors developed cerebral infarcts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
