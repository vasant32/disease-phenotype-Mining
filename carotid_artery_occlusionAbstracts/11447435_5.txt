The safety and efficacy of selective intraarterial administration of urokinase in five male patients, (age range 30 to 65 years, mean 41.2 years), with occlusive stroke involving the carotid territory and a normal cranial computed tomography scan was evaluated. The time elapsed before treatment ranged from one to 10 hours. Digital subtraction angiography disclosed distal internal carotid artery occlusion in one patient and occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or its branches in the others. The urokinase dose ranged from 120,000 to 500,000 units. In two patients who received thrombolytic treatment within three hours of the onset of symptoms, there was a 100% recanalisation associated with excellent neurological recovery. In the remaining three patients, recanalisation rate varied from 0 to 50% with partial recovery in two and no recovery in one patient. None had a haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn because of the small number of patients studied, selective intraarterial urokinase therapy appears to be safe and useful in patients with carotid territory stroke if undertaken early. Only through a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, enough number of patients can be recruited to verify these observations.
