PURPOSE: To describe the endovascular management of a patient with post-dissection internal carotid pseudoaneurysm and stenosis. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man presented with left hemyparesia; angiography showed right internal carotid artery occlusion, left carotid stenosis and pseudoaneurysm. A metallic uncovered stent was implanted by means of a femoral approach. Coils were delivered through the uncovered stent and the pseudoaneurysm was excluded. CONCLUSION: The internal carotid percutaneous implantation of a carotid uncovered stent, and embolization through stent in a patient with stenosis and pseudoaneurysm, appears to be a safe procedure without risk of coils migration.
