 OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the possible modification of the neuroprotective effect of sodium ferulate, when orally co-administered with borneol, in transient global cerebral ischaemia-induced functional, histological and cellular alterations in mice. METHODS: The bilateral common carotid artery occlusion was conducted in C57 BL/6J mice for 25 min. The mice were then subjected to a water maze test over an extended recovery period, followed by an assessment of neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (haematoxylin and eosin staining). The blood-brain barrier permeability (Evans blue tracing), brain oedema and oxidative stress were assayed and histological sections were also immunostained for gliofibrillar acid protein (GFAP) expression. KEY FINDINGS: The ischaemia reperfused mice were associated with long-lasting spatial learning deficits in the absence of other behavioural impairments and with neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, the histological injuries were significantly attenuated by oral co-administration of sodium ferulate and borneol. Furthermore, combined treatment with sodium ferulate and borneol resulted in a significant reduction in brain oedema, GFAP-positive cells, malonaldialdehyde levels and blood-brain barrier permeability, but an increase in superoxide dismutase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Borneol may have benefits for the neuroprotective effect of sodium ferulate against injury induced in the brain by ischaemia/reperfusion.
