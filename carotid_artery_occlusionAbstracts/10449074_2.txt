OBJECTIVE: We present two cases of common carotid artery occlusion that were treated by vascular reconstruction using the transverse cervical artery. METHODS: Two patients with common carotid artery occlusion presented with transient ischemic attacks resulting from decreased cerebral blood flow on the affected side. Both patients underwent vascular reconstruction using the transverse cervical artery. The transverse cervical artery was anastomosed to the ipsilateral external carotid artery at its origin, as a pedicle graft. A superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was then performed. RESULTS: The postoperative courses were uneventful. The transverse cervical artery bypass grafts were patent, and cerebral blood flow increased to normal levels. CONCLUSION: Transverse cervical artery grafting provides a less tedious alternative to saphenous vein interposition grafting for revascularization of the internal carotid artery domain.
