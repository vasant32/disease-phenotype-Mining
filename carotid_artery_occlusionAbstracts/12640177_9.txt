In this study, we tested the hypothesis that combined inhibition of nNOS and iNOS will reduce neuronal damage and the inflammatory response induced by perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia (HI). In 12-day-old rats, HI was induced by right carotid artery occlusion followed by 90 min of 8% O2. Immediately upon reoxygenation, the rats were treated with NOS inhibitors (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24). Neuropathology was scored at 6 weeks after HI on a 4-point scale (n = 12 per group). The expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and mRNA expression for cytokines were measured 12 h after HI (n = 12 per group). Histopathological analysis showed that the ipsilateral hemisphere in the NOS inhibition group was less damaged than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). HI induced a significant increase in HSP70 levels (p < 0.05) in the ipsilateral hemispheres, which tended to be lower in the NOS inhibition group (p = 0.07). HI induced an increase in mRNA expression for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, but there was no difference between the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres. Combined inhibition of nNOS and iNOS did not induce any change in cytokine expression. We conclude that the long-term neuroprotective effects of combined nNOS and iNOS inhibition were not achieved by an altered cytokine response.
