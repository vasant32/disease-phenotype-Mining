The influence of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion on cerebral energy metabolism was studied. The bilateral common carotid arteries of Wistar rats were occluded for 0, 2, 7, and 28 days. Cerebral energy metabolism was evaluated by assaying adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and lactate levels and measuring pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (each time point, n = 6). Pathological changes were assessed light-microscopically by Kl√ºver-Barrera staining and immunohistochemical labeling for astroglia (each time point, n = 3). There were no changes in ATP and PCr levels or PDH activity; there was slight but significant transient lactate accumulation at 2 days. Myelin pallor and increase in immuno-reactive astroglia were only observed at 28 days. These results indicate that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces delayed white matter changes in the corpus callosum of rat brain, but does not affect energy production.
