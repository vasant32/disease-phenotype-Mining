The concentrations of the arachidonic acid metabolites, PGD2, PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, were measured in the cerebral hemispheres of gerbils subjected to unilateral carotid occlusion. Approximately 37 percent of the animals with occlusion had symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In those animals PGD2 and PGF2 alpha levels were elevated in both hemispheres. The levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased only slightly. There was no change of prostaglandin levels in asymptomatic animals. Indomethacin inhibited the increase in the levels of these arachidonic acid metabolites but did not alter brain swelling as judged by a decrease in specific gravity after 6 hours occlusion.
