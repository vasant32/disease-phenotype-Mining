Autoradiographic visualization of the Bmax (maximal binding capacity) and Kd (dissociation constant) of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and [3H]forskolin (FK) was performed after 30-min unilateral carotid artery occlusion in the gerbil brain. These parameters and the local cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured at the level of the caudate-putamen in the same brain using a digital image processing technique developed in our laboratory. The local CBF was measured at the end of the experiment. [3H]PDBu and [3H]FK were utilized as specific ligands to assess the activities of protein kinase C (PKC) and adenylate cyclase (AC), respectively. The local CBF on the occluded side was severely reduced and ranged from 0.2 to 9.0 ml/100 g/min, whereas the local CBF on the non-occluded side exhibited a moderate reduction except in the midline regions. The Bmax values of PDBu and FK were significantly increased not only on the occluded side but also on the non-occluded side in the ischemia group as compared to the corresponding values in the sham group. In contrast, the Kd value of each ligand remained unchanged in the ischemia group. These findings suggest that both the adenylate cyclase and protein kinase C systems may be significantly and diffusely activated in the initial stage of brain ischemia. Thus, severe hemispheric cerebral ischemia in the acute phase may induce severe perturbation of the second messenger systems in extensive bilateral regions.
