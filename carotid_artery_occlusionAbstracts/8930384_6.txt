We examined hsp70 mRNA expression in the brains of transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing CuZn-superoxide dismutase and in wild-type (Wt) littermates after 3 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Significant induction of hsp70 mRNA occurred in the hippocampus, the cortex, and other brain regions of the Tg mice 4 h after ischemia compared to the Wt mice. However, there was no histological damage in the brains of Tg and Wt mice as assessed by both Cresyl violet staining and by TUNEL staining for DNA fragmentation. These data suggest that high levels of CuZn-superoxide dismutase activity increase hsp70 mRNA expression and that intense hsp70 mRNA expression does not predict neuronal damage, even in vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons.
