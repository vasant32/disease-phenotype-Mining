The authors report a patient with rapidly progressive cognitive decline due to bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) resulting in multiple pathologically proven cerebral infarctions including the entire length of the corpus callosum. The gradual evolution of the deficits was suggestive of hemodynamic ischemia. Bilateral ICAO should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapidly cognitive decline. Although ICAO commonly spares the splenium, complete callosal infarction is possible in the presence of bilateral ICAO.
