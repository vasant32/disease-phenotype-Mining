The present study has been designed to investigate the modulatory role of dichlorobenzamil a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor in ischemic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotection in mice. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion, produced a significant rise in cerebral infarct size along with impairment of memory and motor coordination. Ischemic post-conditioning involving three episodes of 10 s carotid artery occlusion with intermittent reperfusion of 10 s proceeding prolonged ischemic insult of 12 min, produced a significant decrease in cerebral infarct size along with reversal of ischemia-reperfusion-induced impairment of memory and motor coordination. Ischemic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotective effects were significantly abolished by pretreatment with dichlorobenzamil (DBZ 0.5, 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor. It may be concluded that Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger possibly plays an important role in ischemic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotection.
