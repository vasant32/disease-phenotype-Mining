Four patients are reported with orbital bruits. They had minor neurological deficits and all proved to have occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery. In three of the patients the retinal artery pressures were normal with no side to side difference, whereas pressure was slightly reduced on the occluded side in one patient. These observations give further evidence that an orbital bruit may indicate occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery with good collateral circulation.
