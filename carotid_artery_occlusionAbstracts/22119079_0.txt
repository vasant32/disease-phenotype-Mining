Berberine is a candidate clinical neuroprotective agent against ischemic stroke. In the present study, we examined the influence of the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of berberine. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and primary neurons, and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in mice were used as in vitro and in vivo ischemia models. We found that the anti-apoptotic effects of berberine against ischemia were indeed mediated by the increased phosphor-activation of Akt (higher p-Akt to total Akt), leading to the intensified phosphorylation of Bad and the decreased cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protease caspase-3. Berberine action is specific for PI3K, rather than the upstream receptor tyrosine kinase. The anti-apoptotic effect is maintained in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD153035, but is suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2.The unique PI3K regulatory subunit p55γ was upregulated by berberine during ischemia-reperfusion and was not blocked by these inhibitors. We constructed a reporter plasmid to detect PI3K p55γ promoter activity and found that berberine enhanced PI3K p55γ promoter activity during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
