In three patients, EEG, jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjvo2) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were monitored to detect cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. In all cases, no changes in Sjvo2 and NIRS were observed during carotid artery occlusion, but in two patients EEG showed changes when carotid artery was clamped. It is important to know the precise mechanism of cerebral monitors to assess the cerebral ischemia in patients with preexisting neurological disorder during carotid endarterectomy.
