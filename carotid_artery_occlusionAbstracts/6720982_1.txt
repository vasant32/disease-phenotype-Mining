Instantaneous renal arterial pressure-flow (P/ Qra ) relations were investigated in 11 anesthetized dogs using the nonpulsatile fall in aortic pressure and renal arterial flow ( Qra ) during cardiac arrest caused by vagal stimulation. We found that P/ Qra relations were linear with an extrapolated zero flow intercept (Ped, effective downstream pressure) of 20.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg and the reciprocal of the slope (Ra, arterial resistance) of 0.6 +/- 0.04 mm Hg X ml-1 X min. These values are markedly lower than the values found in similar experiments in coronary and femoral arteries. Raising renal venous pressure (5 dogs) decreased Qra and elevated Ra and Ped in the ipsilateral renal artery while decreasing Qra and elevating Ra but not Ped in the contralateral renal artery. Carotid artery occlusion (6 dogs) decreased Qra and elevated Ra and Ped. Alpha-Adrenergic blockade (4 dogs) lowered Ped and Ra. Arterial resistance seems to be more important for change in P/Q relations in the renal arterial bed than it is in other arterial beds investigated so far. We suggest that the effective downstream pressure to renal arterial flow is downstream from the glomerular capillaries. The location of the "vascular waterfall " phenomenon appears to be between the intrarenal veins and the veins outside the capsule.
