We examined the potential importance of dexamethasone-mediated alterations in energy metabolism in providing protection against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in immature rats. Seven-day-old rats (n = 165) that had been treated with dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle were assigned to control or hypoxic-ischemic groups (unilateral carotid artery occlusion plus 2-3 h of 8% oxygen at normothermia). The systemic availability of alternate fuels such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, pyruvate, and free fatty acids was not altered by dexamethasone treatment, and, except for glucose, brain levels were also unaffected. At the end of hypoxia, levels of cerebral high-energy phosphates (ATP and phosphocreatine) were decreased in vehicle- but relatively preserved in dexamethasone-treated animals. The local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (lCMRgl) was decreased modestly under control conditions in dexamethasone-treated animals, whereas cerebral energy use measured in a model of decapitation ischemia did not differ significantly between groups. The lCMRgl increased markedly during hypoxia-ischemia (p < 0.05) and remained elevated throughout ischemia in dexamethasone- but not vehicle-treated groups, indicating an enhanced glycolytic flux with dexamethasone treatment. Thus, dexamethasone likely provides protection against hypoxic-ischemic damage in immature rats by preserving cerebral ATP secondary to a maintenance of glycolytic flux.
