Eight patients with common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion underwent bypass with saphenous vein to either the carotid bifurcation (five), the internal carotid artery (two), or the external carotid artery (one). Indications included ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (two), recent nondisabling hemispheric stroke (two), and transient nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms (two). Two asymptomatic patients with CCA occlusion and contralateral internal carotid stenosis underwent prophylactic revascularization prior to planned aortic surgery. There were no perioperative strokes, occlusions, or deaths. Late ipsilateral stroke occurred in two patients, and one patient had a single transient ischemic attack after 2 years. The four patients with preoperative transient cerebral ischemia experienced relief of their symptoms. Duplex ultrasound is an accurate screening modality for distal patency. Collateral filling of the internal or external carotid artery can usually be demonstrated after aortic arch or retrograde brachial contrast injection. End-to-end distal anastomosis after endarterectomy eliminates the original occlusive plaque as a potential source of emboli. The subclavian artery is preferred for inflow on the left. The CCA origin is easily accessible for inflow on the right. Bypass of the occluded CCA is safe and may be effective in relieving transient cerebral ischemic symptoms, although long-term ipsilateral neurologic sequelae may still occur.
