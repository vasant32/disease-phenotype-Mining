A patient with homocystinuria presenting with fatal cerebral infarction that resulted from left common carotid artery occlusion is reported. This 13-year-old, healthy and intelligent girl presented with progressive cerebral infarction. Angiography revealed total occlusion of the left common carotid artery and stenosis of the right common carotid artery. Distal stenosis of bilateral vertebral arteries was also observed. Initially Takayasu arteritis with unusual manifestation was considered. However, later investigations revealed homocystinuria was the underlying cause. The sudden onset of fatal stroke as the initial clinical presentation of homocystinuria, as observed in this previous healthy teenager, is noteworthy. We suggest metabolic screening for homocystinuria when treating a patient with unusual vascular lesions.
