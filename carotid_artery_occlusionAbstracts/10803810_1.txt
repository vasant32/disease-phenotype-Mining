A 63-year-old man was admitted with progressive left hemiparesis and left homonymous hemianopsia of 1 month's duration. During the 2 months before admission, he had suffered from slowly progressive dementia. The diagnosis of right-sided watershed (WS) infarction was made. He exhibited slow progression of dementia and cerebral atrophy during the period of observation after discharge. There was a positive relationship between cerebral atrophy and the degree of dementia. In the present case, WS infarction caused by right internal carotid artery occlusion might be related to dementia and cerebral atrophy.
