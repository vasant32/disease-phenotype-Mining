64 ischemic stroke patients with angiographically verified occlusion of the internal carotid artery were studied. 32 patients underwent surgical revascularization in the acute stage within a few hours of acute onset of stroke. 32 patients had conservative management of treatment. Both groups were compared in regard to mortality rate, functional recovery and clinical findings or neurological deficits and psychiatric disturbances on admission and 4 weeks later. Correlations of functional recovery between the two groups showed no significant differences. Mortality rate in the conservatively managed group however was significantly lower than in the operative group.
