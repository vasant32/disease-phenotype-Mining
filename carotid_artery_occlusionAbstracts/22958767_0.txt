During endovascular revascularization of subacute and chronic occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) it may be difficult to penetrate the lesion. Selecting the appropriate "true lumen", a remnant of what had been the arterial lumen, at the initial step may facilitate the procedure. Because plaque at the carotid bifurcation is known to propagate from the posterior wall, a gateway to this "true lumen" should exist in the anterior side of the occluded stump. This hypothesis was studied retrospectively in our series of revascularizing ICA subacute and chronic occlusion. Eleven patients underwent endovascular revascularization for symptomatic cervical ICA occlusion. Procedures were performed by initially penetrating the occluded stump with a guidewire, followed by supporting catheter advancement through the occluded segment to secure the distal normal arterial lumen. Cases were analyzed with regard to the location of initial guidewire penetration. Eight patients underwent successful revascularization. In five cases, the entry point to the occluded stump was located at the anterior side, and in three, at the posterior side. Two posterior stump penetration cases were met with resistance in guidewire advancement, whereas penetration was smooth in the anterior cases. In addition, two posterior stump penetration cases resulted in contrast stasis in the posterior ICA wall. In our series of revascularizing cervical ICA subacute and chronic occlusion, initially targeting the anterior side of the occluded stump resulted in favorable results. This may be the result of selecting the "true lumen" at the beginning of the procedure.
