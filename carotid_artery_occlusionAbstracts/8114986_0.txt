The relationship between computerized tomography (CT) location of ischaemic strokes and the appearance of collateral circulation on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (USG-D) was investigated in 30 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion. Evidence of collateral circulation via the anterior communicating artery was observed less frequently (88%) among patients with ischaemic lesions in the anterior and middle cerebral artery distribution, as well as the border zone area between these arteries, than in those with ischaemic strokes in the border zone area between posterior and middle cerebral arteries (100%). In patients in whom focal lesions were not found on CT, good collateral circulation via ophthalmic (100%), anterior communicating (100%) and posterior cerebral (84%) arteries was found on transcranial USG-D.
