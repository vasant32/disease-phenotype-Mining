OBJECTIVE: To observe the cerebral circular changes of rabbits during brain ischemia caused by carotid artery occlusion (CAO) with a loading test-cerebral vascular CO2 reactivity (CVR) technique. METHODS: Sixty white rabbits were divided into 6 groups, before and during 0-50 days after CAO, we studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and CVR of frontal lobe on the same side, using laser doppler perfusion imager (LDI). RESULT: The rCBF-lesion caused by CAO could hardly be observed (P > 0.5), but CVR cut down obviously (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The loading test-cerebral vascular CO2 reactivity (CVR) allow the hemodynamic effect of a CAO on the intracerebral circulation to be observed before the reduced rCBF can be detected.
