The authors examine the diagnostic accuracy of ophthalmodynamometry in detecting extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis. 58 patients with T.I.A.s or R.I.N.D.s are studied. The test, compared with angiography, is positive only in 50% of patients presenting unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion.
