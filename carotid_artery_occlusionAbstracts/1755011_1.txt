In order to clarify the effectiveness of extracranial- intracranial bypass in cases of vertebro-basilar occlusive disease, we investigated the operative complication, clinical course and follow-up study of 30 cases undergoing superficial temporal artery-superior cerebellar artery (STA-SCA) bypass surgery. Postoperative angiogram showed the patency of the anastomoses in all cases. No serious surgical complications were observed. The outcome on discharge was excellent, with no morbidity and one mortality which was due to cardiac infarction. In the follow-up study, there were four cases with ischemic symptoms, two with transient ischemic attack and two with completed stroke, one of which was a supratentorial infarction due to internal carotid artery occlusion and the other was a small infarction of pons. There were also two deaths due to cardiac infarction and diabetes mellitus. Favorable outcomes were obtained for the remaining cases. The present study suggests that, STA-SCA bypass, can be performed without surgical and systemic complications and used as an effective therapy for vertebrobasilar ischemia.
