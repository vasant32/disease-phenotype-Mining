Two cases of internal carotid artery occlusion secondary to spontaneous dissection are reported. Both patients presented with transient ischemic attacks. both had antiplatelet aggregation therapy, followed by spontaneous resolution of the occlusion. The period of healing seems to be relatively short. In both cases, restoration of flow was angiographically documented 14 days and 10 weeks after the initial arteriogram. Strategies for treatment of such patients are discussed.
