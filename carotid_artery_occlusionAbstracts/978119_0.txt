Influence of the vagus and carotid sinus nerves on peripheral plasma renin was studied in the cat. Bilateral cervical vagotomy was followed by a sustained increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) of anaesthetized cats made hypervolaemic by intravenous saline infusions. The increase in PRC is attributable to right vagotomy. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion in anaesthetized hypervolaemic cats, either with or without prior vagotomy, or with mechanical prevention of a rise in systemic blood pressure, resulted in no statistically significant increases in peripheral venous PRC, compared with the control animals.
