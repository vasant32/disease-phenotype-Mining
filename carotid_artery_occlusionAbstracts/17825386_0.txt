BACKGROUND: Cerebral ischemia associated with chronic CCA occlusion is a rare condition and raises strategic dilemma when the revascularization is needed. METHODS: Two patients with CCA occlusion presented with ischemic symptom associated with the affected side. Both patients underwent vascular reconstruction by direct carotid endarterectomy to achieve primary restoration of CCA to ICA flow. RESULTS: Successful reopening of the vessels was obtained in both patients without the evidence of postsurgical ischemic event. Follow-up MRA was obtained at later than 6 months after surgery, which demonstrated patent CCA-ICA in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: Direct carotid endarterectomy of the occluded CCA can be safely performed if the preoperative angiography suggest still patent vessels distal to carotid bifurcation and the substantial "back flow" is obtained from ICA during arteriotomy.
