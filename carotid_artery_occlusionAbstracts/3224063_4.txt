In patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, the external carotid artery (ECA) can be both a source of collateral flow and a pathway for emboli. We identified 11 patients with ICA occlusion and ipsilateral ECA stenosis who underwent ECA endarterectomy to determine its role in treating extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Follow-up ranged from 1-65 months, with a mean of 27 months. Seven of eight patients with unilateral disease remained symptom free. The eighth patient had recurrent symptoms that were subsequently diagnosed as hemi-Parkinsonism. Two of three patients with bilateral occlusive disease had developed non-hemispheric symptoms at 12 and 24 months, respectively; the third remains asymptomatic after extracranial-intracranial bypass. None of the seven patients who presented with amaurosis fugax had recurrent visual symptoms. ECA endarterectomy is a safe and effective operation in treating symptomatic patients with ICA occlusion, especially those with transient monocular blindness or unilateral occlusive disease. It is less effective in those patients who have diffuse bilateral occlusive disease.
