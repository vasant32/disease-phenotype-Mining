The new calcium antagonist cerebrocrast intravenously infused in a dose of 0.4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during 15 min prevented erythrocyte deformability disturbances at the end of cerebral ischemia in rats, which was induced by carotid artery occlusion during 30 min. The agents also prevented the deformability 1 hour after the onset of recirculation. Cerebrocrast reduced spontaneous erythrocyte aggregation, the strength of erythrocytic aggregates, and hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. The latter effect was associated with the drug-induced increase in erythrocytic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels.
