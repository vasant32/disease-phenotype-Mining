Neurological and EEG-analytical follow-up examinations in 73 patients with carotid artery occlusion were done for a period of 3 1/2 years after completed stroke. All patients were treated by hyperbaric oxygenation (HO), in 38 cases additionally bypass surgery was performed. Our findings indicate that chronic ischemic alterations of the brain can be improved by HO-therapy and additional recovery can take place after subsequent extra-intracranial arterial bypass operation.
