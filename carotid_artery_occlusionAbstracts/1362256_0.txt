We have previously developed a reproducible model of transient forebrain ischaemia in rats by bilateral carotid artery occlusion combined with temporary increase of ICP. With this model, reversibility of the energy metabolism and intracellular pH (pHi) was investigated by 31P-MRS during 120 min of recirculation in three groups of, respectively, 30, 60, and 120 min of ischaemia. With the induction of ischaemia, ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) disappeared, and measurement of pHi showed severe acidosis in all rats. In the 30 min ischaemia group, both energy metabolism and pHi recovered almost completely. In the 60 min ischaemia group, ATP recovered to 74% of control values, but pHi showed full recovery. In the 120 min ischaemia group, ATP recovered to about 50% of control values, and recovery of pHi was variable. Showing logarithmical changes during recirculation in ATP and PCr, the rate of metabolic recovery was fast during 60 min of recirculation, but it decreased and reached plateau thereafter in all groups. Recovery of pHi was affected by ATP levels, and was precipitously accelerated as ATP levels exceeded 50% of pre-ischaemic values. These results suggest that prolongation of the duration of ischaemia limits the restoration of the energy state, and the quality of pHi recovery after cerebral ischaemia is affected by the degree of ATP recovery during 60 min of recirculation.
