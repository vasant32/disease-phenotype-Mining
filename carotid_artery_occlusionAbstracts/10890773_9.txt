OBJECTIVES: This study uses a porcine model to establish the feasibility of performing endoscopic procedures in the neck using standard techniques currently being employed in preperitoneal endoscopy in the abdomen. STUDY DESIGN: It is a pilot study presented as a case series. METHODS: Ten animals were subjected to anterior deep cervical fascia dissection using standard endoscopic instrumentation. RESULTS: Balloon dissection and CO2 insufflation poses a number of problems: CO2 gas dissection into the chest, CO2 gas embolism into the venous circulation, carotid artery occlusion, and limited visualization causing increased risk of injury to adjacent structures. CONCLUSION: These issues need to be dealt with before such a method could be employed safely in humans. However, with further research and development, endoscopic neck surgery may someday become a reality.
