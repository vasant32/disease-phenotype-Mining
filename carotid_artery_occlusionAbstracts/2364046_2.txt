Patients with one internal carotid artery occlusion and a contralateral stenosis run a significantly higher risk of stroke. We performed endarterectomy of the stenotic carotid in 44 such patients and followed them for mean 54 months (range 1-172 months). Early mortality was 2%. Life-table analysis shows that the incidence of a new stroke was 0.6% per year, the survival rate was 78% after three years, and 70% after five years. We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed in patients with contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion and can significantly improve the long-term prognosis of these patients.
