BACKGROUND: It is still difficult to directly prove the involvement of hemodynamic ischemia in ischemic attacks in patients with occlusive carotid artery diseases. CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we describe the case of a 52-year-old woman with right ICA occlusion who experienced repeated transient weakness of the left extremities during HD for chronic renal failure. Single-photon emission computed tomography showed reductions in CBF and CVR to acetazolamide in the right hemisphere. Real-time NIRS monitoring clearly showed a deterioration in the cerebral oxygenation state in the right hemisphere in response to a BP decrease during HD. Superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis improved SPECT as well as NIRS findings and resolved ischemic attacks during HD. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that NIRS can be a useful tool in detecting hemodynamic ischemia in patients with impaired cerebral perfusion reserves noninvasively and in real time.
