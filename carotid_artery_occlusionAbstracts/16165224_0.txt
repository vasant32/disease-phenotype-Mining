Deep neck space infections in children are not an uncommon presentation to an otolaryngologist and with appropriate antibiotic therapy, often in conjunction with surgical drainage, complications are rare. We report on a case of a 4-year boy who presented with a retropharyngeal abscess that was complicated by ipsilateral carotid artery and internal jugular vein compression. The patient was treated with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and heparin. There were no subsequent neurological or vascular complications. An overview of the management of deep neck infections and their complications are discussed.
