Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) was performed at six different inversion times in nine patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and in 11 control subjects. The hospital's commission on scientific research on human subjects approved the study protocol, and all study subjects gave informed consent. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the middle cerebral artery territories was calculated from the combined signal intensities measured with ASL at the multiple inversion times. In the patients with ICA occlusion, mean CBF values were decreased in the gray matter of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion, as compared with values in the gray matter of the contralateral hemisphere (P < .05) and with values in the gray matter of the control subjects (P < .05). Quantification of CBF with ASL at multiple inversion times can compensate for the blood transit delays in patients with ICA occlusion.
