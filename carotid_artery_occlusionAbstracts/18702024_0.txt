We report on the case of a 45-year-old man with stroke and progressive neurological symptoms. Duplex sonography showed an occlusion of the left common carotid artery as well as an open internal carotid artery due to retrograde flow from the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery with pseudovenous flow. Transcranial duplex sonography showed a pseudovenous flow in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, because of insufficient intracranial collateralisation. During operative revascularisation, a primary shunt from the aortic arch to the internal carotid artery was necessary. After revascularisation, perfusion of the left middle cerebral artery was normal and the neurological symptoms abated. Revascularisation of a common carotid artery occlusion in case of progressive stroke may be indicated. The central position of the shunt and the surgical procedure described provide sufficient cerebral perfusion.
