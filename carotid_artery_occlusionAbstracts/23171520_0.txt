Perinatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury is a leading cause of long-term neurological handicap in newborn babies. Recently, excessive activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and in particular MMP-9, has been implicated in the aetiology of HI injuries to the immature brain. Our previous study suggested that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of the delayed injury processes following HI injury to the developing brain. Given this, we therefore propose that MMP-9 may be a useful target for rescue therapies in the injured developing brain. To address this, we chose to use SB-3CT, a highly selective inhibitor that is known to target only MMP-2 and MMP-9, to attenuate the elevated MMP-9 activity seen following HI injury to the developing brain. Twenty-one-day-old postnatal Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by exposure to hypoxia (8% oxygen for 1 h). SB-3CT (50 mg/kg body weight in 25% dimethyl sulphoxide/75% polyethylene glycol) or an equal volume of vehicle or saline diluent was then administered intraperitoneally at 2, 5 and 14 h following the insult. Gelatin zymography revealed that pro-MMP-9 levels were significantly reduced at 6 h following hypoxic ischaemia (p â‰¤ 0.05). However, our results showed that despite significantly inhibiting brain pro-MMP-9 activity after hypoxic ischaemia, SB-3CT failed to confer significant neuroprotection in postnatal day 21 rats 3 days after an HI insult. Further investigations are warranted using a recently reported selective water-soluble version of SB-3CT or another MMP-9 selective inhibitor to resolve the role of MMP-9 in the aetiology of HI injury in the developing brain.
