NNC-711 [1-(2-((diphenylmethylene)amino)oxy)ethyl)-1,2,4,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride], a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake inhibitor with anticonvulsant activity, was investigated with respect to its cognition-enhancing and neuroprotective potency. In the rat, administration of NNC-711 immediately prior to training prevented amnesia for a passive avoidance task induced by the acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine. NNC-711 was also effective in protecting against ischemia-induced death of CA1 pyramidal neurons in a model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in the gerbil. In addition to a neuroprotective activity, NNC-711 exhibited significant cognition-enhancing actions. Daily administration of NNC-711, immediately prior to a spatial learning task, significantly reduced escape latencies in the water maze paradigm in both mature (postnatal day 80) and aged (28 months) rats. All of the above actions exhibited a bell-shaped response with an optimal dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg. These investigations with NNC-711 and previous clinical observations on the structurally related anticonvulsant tiagabine confirm the potential of GABA reuptake inhibitors as anti-amnesia and cognition-enhancing agents.
