In acute carotid artery occlusion, hemodynamic compromise in addition to artery-artery thromboembolism is the mechanism of ischemia that may lead to a progressive clinical course with enlarging infarcts. The natural course of carotid artery occlusion with a progressive stroke is unfavorable with only about 10% of patients making a good recovery. We report on two patients in whom emergency recanalization of acute carotid artery occlusion with self-expanding stents restored cerebral blood flow and held up progressive stroke.
