Global cerebral ischemia is an important clinical problem with few effective treatments. The hippocampus, which is important for memory, is especially vulnerable during global ischemia. Brain-specific knockout of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) has been shown to be protective in focal ischemia in vivo. 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a natural metabolite of estrogen that is known to inhibit HIF-1 alpha. We tested 2ME2 in a rat model of global cerebral ischemia. Global ischemia was induced with the two-vessel occlusion model (2VO) which entailed hemorrhagic hypotension to a mean arterial pressure of 38-42 mmHg with simultaneous bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 8 minutes. Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 280-350 g) were randomly assigned to three groups: global ischemia (GI, n=17), global ischemia with 2ME2 treatment (GI + 2ME2, n=17) and sham surgery (sham, n=12). 2ME2 treatment (15 mg/kg in 1% DMSO) was rendered 10 minutes after reperfusion. Rats in the GI and sham groups received similar doses of the DMSO solvent. Rats were killed 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after reperfusion. Quantitative CA1 hippocampal cell counts demonstrated significantly lower cell survival in the GI + 2ME2 group compared to either the GI or sham groups, in spite of a statistically significant reduction in HIF-1 alpha by Western blotting analysis of the GI + 2ME2 group. We conclude that 2ME2 worsens outcomes after global ischemia in rats.
