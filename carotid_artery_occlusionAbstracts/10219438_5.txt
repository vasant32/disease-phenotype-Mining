Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a fulminant, often fatal, disease. Aggressive surgical debridement has been considered an important part of treatment. Traditionally, an external or transantral approach has been the classic method. Recently, endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has been tried on several occasions to reach the goal of radical resection. Since 1991, ESS has been used to treat 9 rhinocerebral mucormycosis patients in our department. Among them, ESS was the only surgical procedure in six patients. The other three patients were treated by ESS combined with a transantral procedure. As a result, eight patients (88.9%) have survived the disease. One patient died 5 days after ESS because of an internal carotid artery occlusion. We conclude that ESS can be used to treat rhinocerebral mucormycosis alone or in combination with the traditional surgical procedures. It has the advantage of less operative morbidity and greater operative accuracy.
