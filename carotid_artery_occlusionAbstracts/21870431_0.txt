The cerebral ischemia in rats was induced by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) for 30 min., followed by 45 min reperfusion. BCCAO caused significant depletion in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and significant increase in lipid peroxidation along with severe neuronal damage in the brain. All the alterations except depletion in glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase levels induced by cerebral ischemia were significantly attenuated by 15 days pretreatment with methanolic extract of P. dactylifera fruits (100, 300 mg/kg), whereas 30 mg/kg dose was insignificant in this regard. These results suggest the possible use P. dactylifera against bilateral common carotid artery occlusion induced oxidative stress and neuronal damage.
