This study investigated the distribution of platelet activating factor (PAF) binding sites in the brain and their involvement in global ischemia in a model of bilateral common carotid occlusion in the gerbil. In sagittal sections of gerbil brain, labeling with [3H]PAF was mainly located in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The corpus striatum, the superior and inferior colliculi showed lower binding, while the thalamus was only weakly labeled. Scatchard analysis of the data obtained from displacement curves with unlabeled PAF revealed the presence of one or two populations of binding sites with different affinity constant values depending on the brain structures. When the gerbils were submitted to 10 min ischemia, similar autoradiography with [3H]PAF demonstrated a dramatic reduction of labeling in all brain structures, particularly in the hippocampus. Immunoreactive endogenous PAF concentrations in brain tissues showed a marked increase in ischemic animals: (8977.3 +/- 1113 pg/g wet weight) as compared to sham-operated control: (997.7 +/- 77 pg/g wet weight). Endogenous PAF levels returned to basal values following 30 min reperfusion. These results indicate that PAF may be involved in the early stages of brain ischemia in the gerbil and suggest that endogenous PAF produced during ischemia may contribute to the down-regulation of [3H]PAF binding sites in the brain.
