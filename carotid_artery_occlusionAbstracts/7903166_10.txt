BW619C89 (4-amino-2-(4-methylpiperazin-l-yl)-5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl) pyrimidine) was evaluated for cerebroprotection after focal or global ischaemia. BW619C89, as the mesylate dihydrate salt, 20 mg kg-1, i.v. for 10 min immediately, or with a 1 h delay after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in Fischer rats reduces cortical infarct volume (visualized with (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium) by 49% (p < 0.05) or by 61% (p < 0.001) and improves neurological deficit. Administration of BW619C89 with a 2 h delay is ineffective. BW619C89, given i.p. 0 and 4 h after 20 min of transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in vertebral artery-occluded Wistar rats reduces glutamate release and neuronal cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 sector (p < 0.01) and striatum (p < 0.05). BW619C89 resembles BW1003C87 (5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)-2,4-diaminopyrimidine) in inhibiting veratrine-induced glutamate release and protecting against ischaemic brain damage.
