Computed tomography (CT scanning) was carried out on 35 patients with proven occlusion of the carotid artery. There was a clear correlation of the clinical picture with the CT demonstration of cerebral infarct; 14 patients had no identifiable infarct. The findings were also correlated with angiographic data. The degree of cross or collateral filling of the middle cerebral artery on the affected side correlated better with the clinical features than with the CT data. Radioisotope studies were positive in only 50% of cases in which CT had shown infarction; this was related to the time interval between the onset of symptoms and scanning. The significance of these findings and their relationship to previous clinical necropsy data are discussed.
