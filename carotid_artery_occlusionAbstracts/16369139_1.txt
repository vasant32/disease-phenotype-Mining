Severe internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion is considered to be one of the important causes of stroke. The authors created a complete unilateral carotid artery occlusion model in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats, induced severe hypotension for at least 36 minutes by exsanguination with the target mean arterial pressure being equal or less than 35 mmHg, and investigated the temporal and spatial evolution of cerebral ischemia by diffusion-, T2-, and postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Cerebral ischemia was detected in most regions of the right middle cerebral artery territory during exsanguination. There was no significant relationship between ischemic lesion volume detected on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (ADC lesion volume) and infarction volume found on histopathology. However, there was a linear relationship between the change in ADC lesion volume at blood reinfusion (after reinfusion minus before reinfusion) and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 0.4X + 161.7, P = 0.0066) and a significant logarithmic correlation between the volume of vasogenic edema found on postcontrast T1-weighted image at 1 hour of the postreinfusion period and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 62.1 x logX - 115.4, P = 0.022). In conclusion, although it may be difficult to predict the outcome of cerebral ischemia (infarction volume) from the lesion volume during exsanguination, the evolution of cerebral ischemia may be partly predicted by lesion volume changes seen on the ADC maps at the time of the blood reinfusion or by the severity of blood-brain barrier disruption at the early stage of the postreinfusion period.
