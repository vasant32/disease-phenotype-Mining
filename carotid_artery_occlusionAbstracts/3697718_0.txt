The effects of unilateral carotid artery (left or right) occlusion on the three-dimensional metabolic mapping were studied in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). The brain was freeze-trapped by the liquid nitrogen funnel technique and was analyzed for the two-dimensional distribution of the reduced pyridine nucleotides and oxidized flavoprotein using a time-sharing micro-light guide surface fluorometer/reflectometer. The results could be summarized as follows. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion induced uniform effects in terms of redox state in the cerebral cortex and the olfactory bulbs. After unilateral carotid occlusion, the redox state of the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere was higher and was not affected by blood volume changes as evaluated from the reflectance signal scanned in several brains. The narrow band of tissue near the midline of the ischemic hemisphere connected to the contralateral hemisphere blood supply appeared in a large number of gerbils. The anomaly in the redox state of the intracellular space also appeared in subcortical structures, as seen in all the two-dimensional mappings measured. It seems that blood circulation to the two olfactory bulbs is connected to the same blood vessel. It is suggested that unilateral carotid artery-occluded gerbils may show large variability inside the same hemisphere and therefore results must be evaluated very carefully.
