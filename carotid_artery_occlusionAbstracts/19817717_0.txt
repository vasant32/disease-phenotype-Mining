BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sevoflurane-induced post-conditioning has a neuroprotective effect against incomplete cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: After cerebral ischemia by right common carotid artery occlusion in combination with hemorrhagic hypotension (35 mmHg) for 30 min, 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane was administered for 15 min (Post-C 15, n=8), 30 min (Post-C 30, n=8), or 60 min (Post-C 60, n=8) in rats. Sevoflurane was not administered in control (n=8) and sham control rats (n=8). Neurologic evaluations were performed at 24, 48, and 72 h after ischemia. Degrees of neuronal damage in ischemic hippocampal CA1 and the cortex were assessed by counting eosinophilic neurons, and detection of DNA fragmentation was performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. RESULTS: Neurologic deficit scores in the Post-C 60 group were higher than in the control group at 48 and 72 h post-ischemia (P<0.05). No differences were observed in the percentages of eosinophilic neurons among the control (CA1: 37.3 +/- 25.4, cortex: 26.0 +/- 8.9), Post-C 15 (CA1: 54.0 +/- 21.4, cortex: 30.8 +/- 19.9), or Post-C 30 (CA1: 68.4 +/- 17.5, cortex: 38.0 +/- 11.0) groups in ischemic CA1 and cortices. However, in the Post-C 60 group, the percentages of eosinophilic neurons were higher than in the control group in CA1 and cortices (P<0.05). The percentages of TUNEL-positive cell were similar in the control group and the post-conditioned groups. CONCLUSION: These findings show that sevoflurane administration after ischemia does not provide neuroprotection in rats subjected to incomplete cerebral ischemia.
