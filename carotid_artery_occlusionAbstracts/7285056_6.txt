The percutaneous technique of balloon catheter occlusion of internal and common carotid arteries can produce long-term obliteration of aneurysms and fistulae. Fourteen difficult aneurysms and one carotid-cavernous fistula of the internal carotid artery were thus treated, with success achieved in 13 cases. This technique permits careful control of the occlusion. If neurologic symptoms develop during the procedure, rapid balloon deflation can reverse the deficits in most cases.
