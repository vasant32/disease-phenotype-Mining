In 20 necropsies with 15 stenosed and 17 thrombotic occluded internal carotid arteries there were 46 cerebral infarcts larger than 1 cm diameter. Using portmortem arteriographic and pathological techniques the patterns of the neck and brain artery systems were correlated with the situation and extent of the brain infarcts. Massive infarcts involving two major cerebral artery territories were associated with distal internal carotid artery occlusion and grossly ineffective cervical and circle of Willis anastomoses. Isolated middle cerebral artery territory infarcts were associated with internal carotid occlusion or stenosis and impairment of the circle of Willis anastomoses, perhaps with middle cerebral artery stenosis. The pattern of adequate size arteries determined if these infarcts were total, deep central, anterior, medium or posterior partial territory infarcts. Boundary zone infarcts were associated with internal carotid artery disease and limitation of anterior or posterior circle of Willis anastomoses. These limitations determined which boundary zones were affected. Isolated anterior cerebral artery territory infarcts were associated with bilateral internal carotid disease and an anterior cerebral artery stenosis or small caliber anterior communicating artery. Isolated posterior cerebral artery territory infarcts were associated with internal carotid disease and a direct impairment of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery capability.
