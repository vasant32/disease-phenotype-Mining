Cell membrane depolarization and tissue acidosis occur rapidly in severely ischemic brain. Preischemic hyperglycemia is recognized to increase ischemic tissue acidosis and the present studies were undertaken to correlate depolarization and tissue acidosis during acute focal cerebral ischemia and hyperglycemia. We used a dual-label autoradiography method to simultaneously measure the in vivo distribution of [3H]nimodipine and [14C]DMO (5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione) in brain to identify regions of ischemic depolarization and measure regional net tissue pH. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in separate studies. Measurements were made 30 minutes after combined middle cerebral artery and ipsilateral common carotid artery occlusion in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats. Tissue pH in the ischemic cortex was depressed to 6.76 +/- 0.11 in normoglycemic rats (n = 12) and 6.57 +/- 0.13 in hyperglycemic rats (n = 12), with significantly greater acidosis in the hyperglycemic group (P < 0.001). In contrast the ratio of [3H]nimodipine uptake in the ischemic cortex relative to the contralateral nonischemic cortex was significantly greater in normoglycemic (1.83 +/- 0.45) than hyperglycemic (1.40 +/- 0.50) rats (P < 0.05). Within this region of ischemic cortex CBF was 31 +/- 22 mL/100 g in normoglycemic rats (n = 8) and 33 +/- 22 mL/100 g/min in hyperglycemic rats (n = 9). Cerebral blood flow did not differ between these two groups in any region. Thus hyperglycemia reduced the extent of ischemic depolarization within the cortex during the first 30 minutes of focal cerebral ischemia. This effect may be related to the increased tissue acidosis or to other factors that may lessen calcium influx and preserve cellular energy stores in the ischemic cortex of the hyperglycemic rats.
