OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in high risk patients. BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CE) has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy, but it has limitations. Carotid artery stenting may be a reasonable alternative, particularly in high-risk patients. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of CAS in 170 consecutive patients who underwent the procedure in 192 carotid arteries. Of the patients enrolled, 129 (76%) would have been excluded from the major trials of CE and 54 (32%) were referred by vascular surgeons. This series represents a very high-risk group that included patients with unstable angina, previous ipsilateral CE, contralateral carotid artery occlusion and other severe comorbid illnesses. Only 25 (24%) of 104 symptomatic patients would have met the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) entry criteria. The patients' mean age was 73 +/- 8 years (95 confidence interval [CI] 57 to 89), and 42 patients (25%) were > or = 80 years old. Patients had an independent neurologic examination before and after the procedure. RESULTS: The procedural success rate was 99%, including 73 patients who had a coronary intervention. Mean carotid artery stenosis was 78 +/- 10% before (95 CI 58 to 98) and 2 +/- 3% after the procedure (95 CI -4 to 8). During the initial hospital period and 30 days after CAS, there was one major and two category 2 minor strokes, as well as two category 1 minor strokes (total 30-day stroke rate was 2.9% for treated patients or 2.6% for treated arteries). There were no myocardial infarctions or deaths during or within 30 days of CAS. None of the NASCET-eligible patients had a stroke. At a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 11 months, three patients (2%) had asymptomatic restenosis. No other major strokes or neurologic deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stenting is feasible, can be performed even in high-risk patients and is associated with a low restenosis rate.
