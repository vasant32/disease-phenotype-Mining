Ninety-four asymptomatic patients with internal carotid artery occlusion were followed for a mean of 44 months, 16% suffered strokes and 11.7% reported transient ischemic attacks (TIA). The annual stroke and TIA rates were 4.4% and 3.2%, respectively, the annual mortality was 11.3%. In 27 asymptomatic patients progression of extracranial arterial disease to occlusion was observed: 7.4% of these patients suffered from stroke and 18.5% reported TIA's during that period. Thus the annual stroke rate was lower (1.9%) but the TIA rate higher (4.7%) than post-occlusive rates. These data reflect an increase risk in patients with progressive high-degree carotid stenosis which continues after occlusion. This may favour carotid endarterectomy for selected patients in the pre-occlusive state because medical treatment has not been shown to prevent progression of stenosis to occlusion.
