 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysms of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery generally exhibit a benign clinical course, with mass effect on cranial nerves. Rupture generally leads to carotid cavernous fistula and, rarely, to subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this study we report results of treatment in 85 patients with 86 cavernous sinus aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 15-year period, 85 patients with 86 cavernous sinus aneurysms were treated. There were 77 women (91%) and 8 men, with a mean age of 55.5 years (range 26-78 years). Presentation was cranial neuropathy in 56, carotid cavernous fistula in 8, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1 patient. Twenty-one aneurysms were asymptomatic. Treatment was selective coiling in 31 aneurysms and carotid artery occlusion in 55 aneurysms, 5 after bypass surgery. RESULTS: All 8 cavernous sinus fistulas were closed with coils. There were no complications of coiling and 1 patient had a permanent neurologic complication after carotid artery occlusion (morbidity 1.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 6.9%). Clinical and MR imaging follow-up ranged from 3 months to 12 years. In 52 of 56 (93%) patients presenting with symptoms of mass effect, symptoms either were cured (n = 23) or improved (n = 29). All aneurysms were thrombosed after carotid artery occlusion and at latest MR imaging, 34 of 50 aneurysms (68%) were substantially decreased in size or completely obliterated. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, for patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms, a treatment strategy including selective coiling and carotid artery occlusion was safe and effective. Most symptomatic patients (93%) were improved or cured, and most aneurysms (68%) shrank on follow-up.
