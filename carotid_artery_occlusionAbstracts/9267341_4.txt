BACKGROUND: Extracranial carotid aneurysms are quite rare diseases. Their importance is linked both to critical localization and natural history which can lead to neurological events such as TIA and stroke. The importance of an accurate diagnosis is related to the necessity to carry out an early repair of these lesions and so to achieve the prevention of serious complications with minimal surgical risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Florence from January 1982 to December 1995, 2138 surgical procedures on extracranial carotid arteries carried out. Twenty-one (0.98%) were performed for aneurysms. On the basis of clinical history and instrumental findings we divided the patients into three groups: atherosclerotic aneurysms (AA, 10 cases), dysplasic aneurysms (DA, 6 cases) and pseudoaneurysms (PA, 5 cases). RESULTS: Global mortality and major morbility rate was 4.7% (one patient suffered perioperative stroke). Eighteen (85.7%) were followed by echo color Doppler. No one stenosis and/or dilatation of operated vessel was observed during the mean follow-up period of 24 months. In one case (5.5%) of pseudoaneurysms group an asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion was discovered 3 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, surgical treatment of extracranial carotid aneurysms is associated with satisfactory results and low incidence of perioperative complications that justified an extensive and early surgical therapy.
