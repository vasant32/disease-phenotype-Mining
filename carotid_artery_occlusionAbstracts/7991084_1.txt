We present a case of left striatocapsular infarction manifest clinically as a transient right hemiparesis. MRI showed a left striatocapsular infarct. Striatocapsular infarction, unlike lacunar infarction, is often associated with occlusive disease of the carotid artery. In order to screen the carotid vessels, cervical MR angiography (MRA) was performed during the same examination, demonstrating a left internal carotid artery occlusion, confirmed by contrast arteriography. MRA, a noninvasive modality, can be a useful adjunct to MRI, when diagnostic information concerning the cervical carotid artery is needed.
