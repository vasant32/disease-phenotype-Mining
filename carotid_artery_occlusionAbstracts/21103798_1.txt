Vascular illness of the brain constitutes the third cause of death and the first cause of disability in Cuba and many other countries. Presently, no medication has been registered as a neuroprotector. Neuroprotection with intranasal Neuro-EPO (EPO, erythropoietin) has emerged as a multifunctional therapy that plays a significant role in neural survival and functional recovery in an animal model of stroke. On the other hand, there is limited access to the brain through the blood brain barrier (BBB) for intravenously applied EPO, and the high EPO dosages needed to obtain a protective effect increase the danger of elevated hematocrit levels and practically exclude chronic or subchronic treatment with EPO. A promising approach has been recently developed with a nonerythropoietic variant of EPO, Neuro-EPO, with low sialic acid content, a very short plasma half-life, and without erythropoietic activity, probably similar to endogenous brain EPO. The objective of this work was to determine the neuroprotective effect of intranasal Neuro-EPO in comparison with the human recombinant EPO injected intraperitoneally in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, employing the common carotid artery occlusion model in gerbils. Neuro-EPO has demonstrated a better neuroprotective effect, evidenced through increased viability, improvements of the neurological state and cognitive functions, as well as protection of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, temporal cortex, and the thalamus. In conclusion, the intranasal application of Neuro-EPO has a better neuroprotective effect than intraperitoneal EPO, evidenced by the significant improvement of neurological, cognitive, and histological status in the animal model of stroke employed.
