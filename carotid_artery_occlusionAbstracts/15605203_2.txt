We report a case of a 47-year-old man with a giant thrombosed aneurysm of the right cavernous internal carotid artery who initially presented with headache, double vision and trigeminal numbness. He experienced subsequent asymtomatic proximal occlusion of the parent vessel, revealed by follow-up angiography. This case illustrates the possibility that a giant thrombosed aneurysm may exert enough compression upon the parent vessel to induce flow stasis with resultant intraluminal thrombosis progressing to occlude the entire parent artery.
