Occlusion of intracranial arteries by pituitary apoplexy with resulting infarction is a rare occurrence. A 50-year-old man who presented with a history of sudden onset of frontal headache and visual impairment was admitted to another medical centre and MRI revealed a non-enhancing sellar lesion with suprasellar and infrasellar extension. Thereafter, the patient's consciousness deteriorated progressively and he showed signs of herniation; he was then referred to our centre for further evaluation. CT scanning revealed infarction of the left internal carotid artery territory. Transcranial resection of the tumour followed by a large decompressive craniotomy restored the blood flow in the internal carotid artery. Histological examination revealed the tumour to be a pituitary adenoma that contained formed blood elements. The patient's neurological status did not improve and he died on the ninth postoperative day despite vigorous treatment for controlling intracranial pressure. This case study documents a rare presentation of pituitary apoplexy that caused signs of raised intracranial pressure due to mechanical obstruction of an internal carotid artery with resulting infarction.
