1. The effects of propentofylline (PPF, 25 mg kg(-1) body weight per day) on rat cerebral energy state and cytokine expression as well as on behaviour and histopathology were studied after acute and long-term permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). 2. In the absence of PPF, acute ischaemia led to a decrease in energy-rich phosphates in parietotemporal cortex and hippocampus which correlated with an increase in AMP and adenosine concentrations measured by high-performance liquid chromatography technique. The concentrations of cortical cytokines TNF alpha and IL1 beta were increased 12 and 19 fold, respectively. 3. PPF had a neuroprotective action after 20 min of BCCAO, reducing the deleterious effect of acute ischaemia on rat brain energy state and microglial reaction. Simultaneously, PPF treatment increased cyclic-AMP 3 fold. 4. Three weeks of permanent BCCAO did not significantly disturb brain energy metabolism, microglial reaction or histopathology. However, a significant reduction of 30 -- 50% in rat memory capacities and a locomotor hyperactivity were obtained. 5. Continuous PPF-application, however, led to a marked increase in rat working memory and to reduced locomotor activity, which were returned nearly to control levels by 1 week after permanent BCCAO. In summary, PPF showed a clear neuroprotective effect on cerebral energy state and pro-inflammatory cytokines under conditions of acute global ischaemia. Continuous administration of PPF led to memory improvement during permanent BCCAO. 6. These results underscore the benefit of treatment with PPF in clinical practice, particularly during stroke, but also in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders.
