The case of woman with diagnosis on non-hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma producing reversible occlusion of the internal carotid artery is presented. The obstruction of the internal carotid artery by a pituitary tumor is rare, particularly in the absence of hypophyseal apoplexy. The neuroradiological correlation becomes fundamentally important to demonstrate the complete occlusion or thrombosis of the affected vessel. The complete reestablishment of blood flow of the internal carotid artery after surgery becomes imperative for the complete symptomatological regression.
