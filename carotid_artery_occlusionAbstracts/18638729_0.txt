A unique case of multiple aneurysms associated with bilateral carotid artery occlusion and venous angioma is described. A 42 year old female presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebral angiograms demonstrated(1) a ruptured saccular aneurysm in the right posterior cerebral artery,(2) bilateral occlusion of internal carotid arteries,(3) a rete mirabile in the subtemporal fossa fed by left external carotid artery which connected with the internal carotid artery at the cavernous portion where a saccular aneurysm had formed, and(4) a venous angioma in the posterior fossa. The ruptured aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery was obliterated preserving the anterior choroidal arteries. However, a left hemiparesis developed and CT scan revealed a small low density area in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule postoperatively. A ruptured aneurysm associated with bilateral extracranial carotid occlusion poses a clinical dilemma and treatment of such cases is challenging and difficult. The non-surgical and surgical outcomes of ruptured cerebral aneurysms associated with internal carotid occlusion are reviewed.
