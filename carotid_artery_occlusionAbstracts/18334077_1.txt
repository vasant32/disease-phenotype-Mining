We report a case of HIV-associated carotid vasculitis, causing cerebral infarction. Immediate corticosteroid treatment was followed by improvement, with radiological documentation of reversal of the vasculitic changes, preventing arterial occlusion. Vasculitis should be considered as a diagnosis in stroke in HIV and steroid treatment considered as a potentially life-saving intervention.
