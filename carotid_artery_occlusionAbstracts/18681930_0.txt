Subclavian steal is a well-described angiographic finding and clinical syndrome that rarely results in vertebrobasilar ischemic symptoms. In classic subclavian steal, left subclavian artery (SA) stenosis occurs proximal to the left vertebral artery (VA) origin. We report a symptomatic variant of this syndrome that occurred in the setting of left common carotid artery occlusion and anomalous origin of the left VA directly from the aortic arch. The steal and symptoms resolved after stenting of the left SA stenosis.
