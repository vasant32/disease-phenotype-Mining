 BACKGROUND: The main treatment for acute arterial ischemic stroke is intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis within a particular time window. Endovascular mechanical embolectomy is another treatment option in the case of major artery occlusion. Endovascular mechanical embolectomy is a useful technique for restoring blood flow in patients with large-vessel occlusion, and especially in those who are contraindicated for thrombolytics or in whom thrombolytic therapy has failed. CASE REPORT: We report herein two cases of emergency microsurgical embolectomy for the treatment of acute middle cerebral artery and internal carotid artery occlusion as an alternative treatment for major artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency microsurgical mechanical embolectomy may be an alternative treatment option for restoring blood flow in selected patients with large-vessel acute ischemic stroke.
