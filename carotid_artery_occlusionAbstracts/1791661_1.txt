Blood pressure and heart rate changes were recorded on supine or prone head-up tilt and on carotid artery occlusion in normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats (65 mg/kg). In general supine tilt induced a larger blood pressure fall, slower blood pressure recovery from the fall and larger heart rate fall than prone tilt, both in normal and diabetic rats. Heart rate recovery from the fall was slightly larger in prone than in supine tilt in normal rats. The blood pressure fall and heart rate fall accompanying the tilt were statistically larger in diabetic than in normal rats. Furthermore, blood pressure recovery from the fall was statistically more rapid and larger in normal than in diabetic rats. The exaggerated blood pressure fall with the tilt of diabetic rats might correspond to postural hypotension. Blood pressure rise and heart rate rise with carotid artery occlusion were smaller in diabetic than in normal rats. Blood pressure changes with cervical sympathetic or vagus stimulation were almost the same in normal and diabetic rats. However, in diabetic rats such cervical autonomic nerve stimulation produced larger heart rate changes than in normal rats.
