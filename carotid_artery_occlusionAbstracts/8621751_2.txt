The flow threshold for alterations of the in vitro [3H]cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding, an indicator of the total amount of particulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was evaluated in the gerbil brain after 30 min, 2 h, and 6 h of unilateral common carotid artery occlusion, respectively. The autoradiographic method developed in our laboratory enabled us to measure the [3H]cAMP binding and local CBF in each region of the same brain. The ischemic flow thresholds for reduction of the cAMP binding in the hippocampus CA1 were 18, 34, and 49 ml 100 g-1 min-1 after 30-min, 2-h, and 6-h ischemia, respectively. These values were higher than those in other regions such as the hippocampus CA, and temporal cerebral cortex in each duration of ischemia. These findings indicate that (a) the ischemic flow threshold for perturbation of the cAMP system may be higher in the hippocampus CA1 than in other brain regions, suggesting that the hippocampus CA1 could be especially vulnerable to acute ischemic stress; and (b) the level of the aforementioned threshold may increase progressively during the time course of ischemia in particular regions such as the hippocampus CA1 and CA3, suggesting that the duration of ischemia exerts a definite influence on the viability of the ischemic neuronal cells in these regions.
