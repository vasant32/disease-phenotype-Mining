 OBJECTIVES: To determine the neuroprotective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and Selenium (Se), and the combination of these agents on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in a rat model of transient global cerebral I/R. METHODS: This experimental study took place in the Animal Research Laboratory at Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey in the year 2006. Fifty rats were subjected to cerebral I/R induced by right carotid artery occlusion technique for a duration of 45 minutes, and then were treated with EGb761 (50 mg/kg/day, ip) and Se (0.625 mg/kg, ip), alone or in combination for 14 days after surgery. Superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in the hippocampal tissues from 25 animals. Histopathological examinations were also carried out under light and electron microscopy from the rest of animals. RESULTS: The results suggest that EGb761 has a potent neuroprotective effect against cerebral I/R induced injury in rat brain that is comparable with that of Se. However, the combined use of EGb761 and Se does not further protect from neuronal injury when compared with the use of both agents alone. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that administration of EGb761, Se and its combination with EGb761 have significant neuroprotective effects on I/R injury in rats via suppression of oxidative stress.
