A 10-month-old boy presented with traumatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion caused by blunt injury after falling from a baby carrier attached to a standing bicycle. Physical examination found bruises on the scalp in the right temporal region and the right shoulder, but no wound in the neck. Chest radiography showed a right clavicular fracture. He developed left hemiparesis at 19 hours after the injury. Computed tomography revealed cerebral infarct and angiography showed cervical ICA occlusion. Conservative therapy with hemodilution was given under a diagnosis of cervical ICA occlusion caused by extension and rotational head injury. Traumatic cervical ICA occlusion due to blunt injury is not uncommon in adults, but extremely rare in infants. We would like to emphasize the dangers of leaving a baby unattended in a carrier attached to a standing bicycle.
