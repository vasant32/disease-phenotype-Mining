An increase of ceramide, which is the major component of sphingolipids, was found in the ischemic human brain of an acute case of internal carotid artery occlusion. Amide-linked fatty acids in the ceramide isolated from the ischemic human brain were mostly non-hydroxy fatty acids, such as stearic acid (66.9%) and palmitic acid (20.2%). Other long-chain fatty acids, C24:0 and C21:1, were rare components in the ceramide. The ceramide contained C-20 sphingosine, and the ratio of C-20 to C-18 was 0.13. These findings indicate that an ischemic insult accelerates the degradation of gangliosides and causes an accumulation of ceramide in the ischemic human brain.
