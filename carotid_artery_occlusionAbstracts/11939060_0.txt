O, O-acetyldaurisoline(Adau) is a derivative of daurisoline (Dau). In cultured PC12 cells, Adau was found to inhibit K+, Bay K8644 and norepinephrine induced intracellular free calcium concentration increase. Adau was also shown to protect PC12 cells from hypoxia-reoxygenation injury with EC50 of 64.3 +/- 12.5 mumol.L-1 by MTT assay. Adau (2.5, 5 and 10 mg.kg-1, i.v.) administrated 30 min before ischemia in bilateral carotid artery occlusion and four-vessel occlusion rats, attenuated the increase of lipid peroxide content and the decrease of SOD activity. These results show that Adau have significant protective effects against ischemic injury.
