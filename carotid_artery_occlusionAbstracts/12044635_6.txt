Apoptosis is thought to be implicated in delayed neuronal cell death following transient forebrain ischemia. Recently, apoptosis in neurons induced by an inhibitor of serine/threonine (ser/thr) protein phosphatases (PPs) has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of transient forebrain ischemia on the expression of ser/thr PPs in the brain of Mongolian gerbils. At 24 h after 5-min bilateral carotid artery occlusion, Northern blotting analysis revealed the increase of PP1 mRNA expression in the vulnerable CA1 region of the hippocampus and striatum, but not in the cortex and CA3 region. In contrast, the protein level of PP1 detected by Western blotting analysis decreased in all regions. We conclude that the inhibition in PPs expression in the vulnerable regions may affect cell death after transient forebrain ischemia.
