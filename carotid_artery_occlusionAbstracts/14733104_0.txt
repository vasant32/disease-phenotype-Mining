An 83-year-old female patient, who had previously undergone mitral valve replacement using bioprosthesis at 15 years ago, presented symptoms of congestive heart failure. Mitral valve regurgitation was caused by structural deterioration of the bioprosthetic valve, and replacement of the bioprosthesis was indicated. Digital subtraction angiography revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, which put this patient at high risk to cerebral complications during heart valve surgery. Administration of acetazolamide induced a marked decrease in the blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere. Re-replacement of the mitral valve was successfully performed under high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. Intra-aortic balloon pumping produced pulsatile blood flow with a peak pressure of 90-100 mmHg during the cardiopulmonary bypass. She recovered after surgery with no neurological complication. We believe the pulsatile cerebral perfusion produced by the intra-aortic balloon pumping with high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass was effective for preventing cerebral complications in this patient with internal carotid artery occlusion.
