 BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined how carotid endarterectomy affects patients' view of their quality of life. METHODS: Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy from January 1996 to March 1997 at the John Radcliffe Hospital completed the United Kingdom Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Questionnaire before undergoing the procedure and again at 3 months afterward. Scores were compared with population normal values. RESULTS: In 50 patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, there was significant improvement in the SF-36 overall "change in health" score after the procedure compared with beforehand (61.0 +/- 3.7 vs 44.5 +/- 3.4, P =.003, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the group's mean SF-36 subscores after operation compared with before the procedure. The physical subscores were below age-adjusted healthy population means but similar to those for chronically ill patients (physical function subscore P =.015 vs normal, P =.89 vs ill; role limitation-physical subscore P =.007 vs normal, P =.89 vs ill). Patients with postoperative complications did not have an improved change in health score (-12.5 vs 22.0, P =.03, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no effect on change in health score because of other risk factors or in patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion or a history of preoperative stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease undergoing an uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy perceive improved quality of life and overall health. There is no perception of worsened pain, energy, or physical or mental function after the procedure. These results confirm that patients believe that performance of carotid endarterectomy improves their overall health, supporting the surgical approach to carotid artery disease.
