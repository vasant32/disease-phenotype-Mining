Bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion produced significant cerebral infarction and impaired short-term memory, motor co-ordination and lateral push response. Individual pretreatments with chlorophyll and aqueous extracts of B. monniera and V. wallichii markedly attenuated ischaemia-reperfusion induced cerebral injury in terms of decreased infarct size, increase in short-term memory, motor in coordination and lateral push response. The results suggest that chlorophyll and aqueous extracts of B. monniera and V. wallichii prevent ischaemia-reperfusion induced cerebral injury with comparable potency.
