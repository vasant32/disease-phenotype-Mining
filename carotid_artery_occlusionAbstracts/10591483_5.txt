Mongolian gerbils orally administered with soybean lecithin transphosphatidylated phosphatidylserine (SB-tPS, 240 mg/kg) for 5 days were subjected to cerebral ischemia by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. The pyramidal cell damage of the hippocampal CA1 subfield was classified into 4 grades according to the proportion of damaged neurons on the tenth day after the ischemic treatment. The damage score of the SB-tPS group was statistically less than that of the control group. This suggests that the pre-administration of SB-tPS may relieve the delayed neuronal cell death caused by cerebral ischemia.
