Ophthalmic artery blood flow in 5 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion of sudden onset was monitored by an ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter to investigate the possible relationship to spontaneous recanalization of the occluded artery. The occluded internal carotid arteries of 2 patients were confirmed angiographically to recanalize and the reversed flow of their ophthalmic arteries changed to physiological flow after the recanalization. The ophthalmic artery blood flow remained reversed in 2 patients whose occluded internal carotid arteries did not recanalize on the follow up angiograms. In the other patient, whose ophthalmic artery blood flow was not detected by the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter in the acute stage, physiological flow through the ophthalmic artery was detected later. The occluded internal carotid artery did not recanalize and this physiological ophthalmic artery blood flow was filled through the circle of Willis.
