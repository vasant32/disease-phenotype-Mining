PURPOSE: To report the utility of proximal brain protection by flow reversal in endovascular management of critical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis coexisting with ipsilateral external carotid artery (iECA) occlusion. CASE REPORT: Four patients with a symptomatic, critical ICA stenosis (in-stent restenosis in one) and iECA occlusion were admitted for carotid artery stenting (CAS). In all cases, the stenosis severity and high-risk lesion morphology precluded the use of filter protection. The "tailored" CAS algorithm indicated that a proximal anti-embolism system should be used to maximize the potential for effective neuroprotection. The flow reversal system, which consists of an independent guiding sheath balloon positioned in the common carotid artery (CCA) and an iECA balloon-wire, was employed, using the CCA balloon only. The system was well-tolerated, and the CAS procedures were uneventful. CONCLUSION: Due to a unique design with separate CCA and iECA balloons, the flow reversal system can be used for proximal neuroprotection during CAS in severe, symptomatic ICA lesions coexisting with iECA occlusion.
