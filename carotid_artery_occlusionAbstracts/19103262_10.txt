Deferoxamine (DFO) and erythropoietin (EPO) have each been shown to provide neuroprotection in neonatal rodent models of brain injury. In view of the described anti-oxidative actions of DFO and the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of EPO, we hypothesized that the combination of DFO and EPO would increase neuroprotection after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury as compared to single DFO or EPO treatment. At postnatal day 7 rats underwent right common carotid artery occlusion followed by a 90-min exposure to 8% oxygen. Rats were treated intraperitoneally with DFO (200mg/kg), recombinant human EPO (1 kU/kg), a combination of DFO-EPO or vehicle at 0, 24 and 48 h after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and were sacrificed at 72 h. DFO-EPO administration reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. Early neuronal damage was assessed by staining for microtubuli-associated protein (MAP)-2. In our model 63+/-9% loss of ipsilateral MAP-2 was observed after HI, indicating extensive brain injury. DFO, EPO or DFO-EPO treatment did not improve neuronal integrity as defined by MAP-2. Cerebral white matter tracts were stained for myelin basic protein (MBP), a constituent of myelin. Hypoxia-ischemia strongly reduced MBP staining which suggests white matter damage. However, DFO, EPO and DFO-EPO treatment had no effect on the loss of MBP staining. Finally, HI-induced loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase staining was not attenuated by DFO, EPO or DFO-EPO. Although DFO-EPO treatment reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3(+) cells, treatment with DFO, EPO, or with the combination of DFO and EPO did not protect against gray or white matter damage in the experimental setting applied.
