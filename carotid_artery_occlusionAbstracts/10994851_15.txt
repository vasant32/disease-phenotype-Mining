The protein kinase Akt/PKB has been implicated in antiapoptosis and neuronal survival. The authors now show that Akt is phosphorylated in the hippocampus during the early reperfusion period after 3.5 minutes bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) in the gerbil. Repeated sublethal ischemia induces ischemic tolerance, which is known as ischemic preconditioning. Ischemic preconditioning does not affect the amount of Akt protein, but rather decreases the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 after 10 minutes reperfusion after 3.5 minutes BCAO. These results suggest that although Akt may play a role in neuronal survival after ischemia, it may not play a role in ischemic tolerance by preconditioning.
