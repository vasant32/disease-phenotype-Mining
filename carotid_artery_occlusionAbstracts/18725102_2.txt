The authors describe a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion, bilateral external carotid artery (ECA) stenosis, and suboptimal collateral circulation from the right ECA to the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient manifested clinical and radiographic signs of hyperperfusion syndrome following stent placement in the right ECA. This represents a rare case of a stent placed in the ECA of a patient in addition to the development of hyperperfusion syndrome after the procedure.
