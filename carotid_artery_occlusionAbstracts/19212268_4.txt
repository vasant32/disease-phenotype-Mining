BACKGROUND: Postischemic endogenous neurogenesis can be dose-dependently modulated by volatile anesthetics. The intravenous anesthetic propofol is used during operations with a risk of cerebral ischemia, such as neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, and vascular surgery. The effects of propofol on neurogenesis are unknown and, therefore, the object of this study. METHODS: Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to treatment groups with propofol administration for 3 h: 36 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) propofol with or without cerebral ischemia and 72 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) propofol with or without cerebral ischemia. In addition, 7 rats with propofol administration for 6 h and 14 treatment-naive rats were investigated. Forebrain ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion and hemorrhagic hypotension. Animals received 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine for 7 days. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine-positive neurons were counted in the dentate gyrus after 9 and 28 days. Spatial learning in the Barnes maze and histopathologic damage of the hippocampus were analyzed. RESULTS: Propofol revealed no impact on basal neurogenesis. Cerebral ischemia increased the amount of new neurons. After 28 days, neurogenesis significantly increased in animals with low-dose propofol administered during cerebral ischemia compared with naive animals, whereas no significant difference was observed in animals with high-dose propofol during ischemia. Neuronal damage in the CA3 region was increased at 28 days with high-dose propofol. Postischemic deficits in spatial learning were not affected by propofol. CONCLUSIONS: Independent effects of propofol are difficult to ascertain. Peri-ischemic propofol administration may exert secondary effects on neurogenesis by modulating the severity of histopathologic injury and thereby regenerative capacity of the hippocampus.
