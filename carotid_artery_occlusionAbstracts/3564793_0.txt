The changes in the rheoencephalography (REG) values on the side of the occlusion was studied in 18 patients with arterial aneurysms during intravascular manipulations for balloon occlusion of the internal or external carotid artery. Statistically significant changes of the REG amplitude occurred in occlusion of the external carotid artery. Occlusion of the internal carotid artery failed to produce statistically significant changes of the REG amplitude.
