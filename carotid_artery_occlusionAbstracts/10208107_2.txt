A case of a successful systemic thrombolysis of an acute middle carotid artery occlusion is reported. The case underlines the role of contrast-enhanced transcranial color-coded duplex sonography as a noninvasive technique for rapid diagnosis of vessel occlusion in acute stroke. The diagnostic potential of transcranial color-coded duplex sonography for indication and monitoring of intravenous systemic thrombolytic therapy is demonstrated.
