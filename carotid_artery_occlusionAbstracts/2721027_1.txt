1. We studied whether or not circulating catecholamines of adrenal origin play a major role in cardiovascular responses evoked by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (3 min) in anaesthetized dogs. 2. In the control group, the following parameters increased significantly (P less than 0.05) during bilateral carotid occlusion: aortic systolic pressure, heart rate, net adrenal catecholamine output, net renal noradrenaline output, and plasma catecholamine concentrations in aortic blood. Similar responses were obtained during the second occlusion performed approximately 25 min after the first occlusion. 3. After functional adrenalectomy (ADRX: diversion of adrenal venous blood flow), the increase in aortic adrenaline concentration observed during bilateral carotid occlusion was abolished. The increase in aortic noradrenaline concentration during the occlusion was significantly attenuated by approximately 60% (P less than 0.01) after ADRX. 4. The increase in net renal noradrenaline output during bilateral carotid occlusion after ADRX was not different from that observed before ADRX. Similarly, the response of aortic systolic pressure and heart rate during the occlusion was unaffected by ADRX. Furthermore, the increase in net adrenal catecholamine output during the occlusion was not affected by ADRX itself. 5. From these results, we conclude that the increase in circulating catecholamines of adrenal origin during bilateral carotid occlusion is not a major determinant for the increases in aortic pressure and heart rate. The results suggest that these cardiovascular responses during the occlusion are mediated principally by neuronal noradrenaline released from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals.
