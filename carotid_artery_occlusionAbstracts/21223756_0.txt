 OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of compensation by collateral circulation and clinical locations in ischemic stroke cases. METHODS: A total of 25 ischemic stroke cases were retrospectively analyzed. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and DSA (digital subtraction angiography) were performed in all cases. Each patient was found to have at least one cerebral artery occlusion by DSA. The quantity relationship between collateral circulation and ischemic stroke location was analyzed by SPSS 11.5 statistics software. RESULTS: Among all cases, 46 arterial occlusions were found by chance. DSA demonstrated internal carotid artery occlusion (n = 24) and vertebral & basilar artery occlusion (n = 22). And all cases had at least one collateral circulation. Among 23 cases of single collateral circulation, there were 8 cases of single ischemic stroke locations and 15 cases of multiple ischemic stroke locations; among 23 cases of multiple collateral circulations, there were 18 cases of single ischemic stroke locations and 5 cases of multiple ischemic stroke locations. CONCLUSION: Effective collateral circulation can be established spontaneously through multiple ways when cerebral artery occlusion takes place if an intact Wills circle is present. Multiple collateral circulations may significantly decrease the quantity of ischemic stroke locations.
