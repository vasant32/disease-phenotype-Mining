In urethane-anaesthetized rats the effects of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists and desensitization of P2-purinoceptors with alpha,beta-methylene ATP on the pressor reflex responses were investigated. Pressor responses were elicited by electrical stimulation of the central end of the sciatic nerve, by asphyxia and by occlusion of the common carotid artery. Responses to sciatic nerve stimulation and to asphyxia, but not those to carotid artery occlusion were entirely suppressed by dihydroergotamine and phentolamine. Under the action of dihydroergotamine the sinocarotid reflex decreased by over 70% in 40% of the experiments. In 60% of experiments the response was only slightly reduced or even augmented, but it was entirely inhibited by subsequent desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene ATP. The magnitude of response to sciatic nerve stimulation was almost unaffected by alpha,beta-methylene ATP, while the response to carotid occlusion was decreased by 40-50%. The recovery of purinoceptor sensitivity to alpha,beta-methylene ATP was accompanied by restoration of the sinocarotid reflex. It is suggested that purinergic neurotransmission plays a considerable role in the pressor sinocarotid reflex, while in the pressor response to stimulation of somatic afferents its role is negligible.
