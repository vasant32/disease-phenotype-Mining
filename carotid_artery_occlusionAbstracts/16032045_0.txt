AIMS: To compare the potential humaneness of three types of neck-hold killing traps in terms of the blood vessels that are occluded, and to examine the anatomy of the blood vessels that supply blood to the possum's brain. METHOD: The prevalence of occlusion of the common carotid arteries and the trachea was examined in 33 possums which were caught with Timms, LDL and Conibear 160 traps. The anatomy of the blood supply to the brain was examined in six possums using a resin casting technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of complete bilateral common carotid artery occlusion was 77% for the Timms trap, 45% for the LDL trap and 22% for the Conibear 160 trap. The major route for blood supply to the brain was via the common carotid arteries. CONCLUSION: Where the aim is to kill possums quickly by ischaemia of the brain, the Timms trap is to be preferred over the LDL and Conibear 160 traps.
