The relationship of neurotransmitters and neuroeffectors to the energy state of the brain was examined in the gerbil model of ischemia after 5 and 15 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion only or with 1 hr of reperfusion. The gerbil brains were fixed by microwave irradiation and a total of 15 metabolites were measured from a single piece of tissue from either the hippocampus or the striatum. The rapid alterations in energy-related compounds and cyclic nucleotides appeared to be directly related both to the loss of oxygen and glucose during ischemia and the resupply of these nutrients during reflow. Significant reduction in the level of monoamines occurred principally during reflow, at a time when the energy-related metabolites were restored. It is proposed that the changes in monoamines were triggered by other ischemic-induced events unrelated to energy depletion.
