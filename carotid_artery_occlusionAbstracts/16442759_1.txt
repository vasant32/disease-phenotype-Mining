The present study was designed to evaluate the hypotensive properties and the mechanisms of action of the stem bark aqueous extract of Musanga cecropioides R.Br. Apud Tedlie (MCW) in anesthetized rats of Sprague-Dawley strain, through an invasive direct blood pressure measuring procedure. Thirty adult rats, weighing 150-230 g, were grouped into five groups of six rats each. The effects of the intravenous graded doses (0.0005-0.05 mg/kg) of the extract on the blood pressure indices were investigated. Its underlying mechanisms were also studied using additional five groups of rats. The results showed that the extract caused a dose dependent fall in the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure and heart rate of the rats. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCO) caused a reflex increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate which were significantly attenuated by the extract injection. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) blockade with 5 mg/kg of Captopril and cholinergic blockade with 0.2 mg/kg of atropine significantly attenuated the hypotensive response to MCW. However, the pattern of MAP fall in rats pretreated with a combination of Promethazine (1 mg/kg) and Cimetidine (15 mg/kg) was not significant. The results of the study was able to demonstrate dose dependent hypotensive effect of MCW and that its vasorelaxant effects may be through inhibition of sympathetic, cholinergic control of the arterial pressure and most significantly through ACE blockade. However, the phytochemical, elemental and toxicological studies of this potential antihypertensive still needed to be investigated.
