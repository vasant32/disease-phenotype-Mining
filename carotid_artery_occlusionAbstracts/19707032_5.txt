AIM: To report a patient with diabetic rubeosis who suffered from acute retinal ischemic change and stroke after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. METHODS: A 55-year-old man had diabetes with unilateral rubeosis and macular edema. Three days after receiving intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.1 ml), he developed acute vision loss and change of consciousness. A complete ocular examination, fluorescein angiography, carotid artery Doppler sonography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were performed. RESULTS: Best corrected visual acuity before injection was 6/60 in the left eye. He had underlying left carotid artery stenosis combined with bilateral preproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Three days after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, acute ocular ischemic syndrome occurred. He also suffered from acute stroke, and brain magnetic resonance angiography showed total left internal carotid artery occlusion. The final visual acuity was no light perception in the left eye and 3/6 in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving intravitreal injections of bevacizumab should be evaluated for potential systemic risk factors such as carotid insufficiency, coagulopathy and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Acute ocular ischemic change may be associated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in patients with vascular compromised diabetic retinopathy and/or underlying stenosis of the carotid artery.
