The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor involved in a diverse range of pathological conditions. To analyze the roles of RAGE and its decoy receptor, endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), in the global cerebral ischemia, three different mouse cohorts, wild-type, RAGE⁻/⁻, and esRAGE transgenic (Tg) mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that expression of RAGE was induced in the vascular cells at 12 h, and then in the neurons and glia from 3 to 7 days in the hippocampus after BCCAO. The numbers of surviving neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were significantly higher in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice than those in wild-type mice in the periods between 24 h and 7 days after BCCAO. Lower levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and higher levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), together with enlarged vascular areas were observed in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice at 12 h after BCCAO. In the later periods, expressions of glia-derived inflammatory mediators TNFα and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were reduced in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice. These results suggest that RAGE may contribute to delayed neuronal death after global cerebral ischemia by enhancing vascular injury and deleterious glia-mediated inflammation.
