A 51-year-old woman was diagnosed as Crow-Fukase syndrome on July 1997, presenting with lymph node swelling, polyneuropathy, hepatomegaly, hypothyroidism, renal dysfunction, edema and skin change. Lymph node swelling and polyneuropathy improved in some degree after chemotherapy. She was admitted to our hospital on march 6, 1998 because of consciousness disturbance, right hemiparesis and non-fluent aphasia after fever and hypotension. The next day of admission, consciousness disturbance, right hemiparesis and non-fluent aphasia disappeared. MR images of the brain revealed low intensity on a T1-weighted image and high intensity on a T2-weighted image in the left parietal lobe. Furthermore, MR images also revealed diffuse hypertrophic dura matter with enhancement by Gd-DTPA, which made the diagnosis of chronic cranial pachymeningitis. The cerebral angiographies showed bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. The cerebrospinal fluid showed normal cell count, total protein level of 82 mg/dl, and IgG level of 18 mg/dl. Since there has been very few case reports describing intimate relationship between Crow-Fukase syndrome and pachymeningitis, and between carotid occlusion and pachymeningitis, we speculated that the pachymeningitis might be associated with Crow-Fukase syndrome. Furthermore, pachymeningitis might be a cause of her bilateral carotid occlusion. The number of cases of Crow-Fukase syndrome associated with cerebrovascular disease was very rare. This is the first case which had bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion probably caused by chronic cranial pachymeningitis. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to cerebrovascular disease when the patient of Crow-Fukase syndrome is associated with pachymeningitis.
