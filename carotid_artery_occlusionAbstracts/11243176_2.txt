Acute incomplete brain ischemia in rats was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion(BCAO). BCAO results in severe suppression of EEG and increase of brain water content. Left middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) in rats by electrical coagulation results in increase of brain water content of ipsilateral hemisphere and contralateral hemiparesis. The typical ischemic neuropathological damage emerges in both BCAO and MCAO models. Intraperitoneal injection of puerarin significantly helps improve all these brain ischemic disturbances.
