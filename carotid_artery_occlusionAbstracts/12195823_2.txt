Tissue ischaemia-reperfusion evokes toxic and harmful biochemical processes such as oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate the indices of tissue damage in rat liver and brain after ischaemia-reperfusion injury of these organs, and to study prospective cytoprotection of molecules such as the novel anti-inflammatory N-(2-thiolethyl)-2-(2-[N'-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino] phenyl)acetamide (compound 1) and alpha-tocopherol. Two experimental models were studied: firstly, 30 min liver ischaemia via hepatoduodenal ligament clamping followed by 60 min reperfusion; and secondly, 45 min cerebral ischaemia via bilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by 90 min reperfusion. Compound 1 and alpha-tocopherol were administered intraperitoneally before induction of ischaemia. We hereby report that compound 1, a molecule that combines potent in-vitro antioxidant and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity with low gastrointestinal toxicity, offered protection in-vivo against liver or brain ischaemia-reperfusion-induced damage. Both compound 1 and alpha-tocopherol prevented changes in lipid peroxidation in the rat liver and brain tissue and in tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) levels in brain. Also compound 1 attenuated glutathione depletion, evoked by ischaemia-reperfusion, in the rat brain but not in the liver. These results could be explained on the basis of the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties of compound 1 and suggest its beneficial effect and potential therapeutic use in post-ischaemic injury.
