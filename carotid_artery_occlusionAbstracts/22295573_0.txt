Neurotrophins regulate key function of nervous tissue cells. Analysis of neurotrophins mRNA expression is an appropriate tool to assess therapeutic efficiency of the anti-stroke drugs. We have analyzed the effect of synthetic peptide semax and its C-terminal Pro-Gly-Pro tripeptide upon mRNAs expression of neurotrophins Ngf, Bdrf, Nt-3 and their receptors TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, p75 in rat frontal lobes, hippocampus and cerebellum after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. The animals were decapitated 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 h after the operation. The mRNA expression of neurotrophins and their receptors was assessed by relative quantification using real-time RT-PCR. Our showed that ischemia causes a significant decrease in gene expression in the hippocampus. Semax and PGP affected the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors predominantly in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the ischemized animals. In the frontal cortex, Semax treatment resulted in a decrease of mRNA level of receptors, while PGP treatment increased the level of these mRNA. Maximal neuroprotective effect of both peptides has been observed in the hippocampus 12 h after occlusion. A decrease of gene expression of neurotrophins and their receptors caused by the occlusion was overcome by Semax and PGP. These results clarify the semax mechanism of and present certain features of mRNA's expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in experimental conditions.
