The treatment of external carotid artery stenosis has been described with a variety of operative interventions. We present a patient who presented with amaurosis fugax and a critical left external carotid artery stenosis with known left internal carotid artery occlusion. We treated this stenosis with angioplasty and stenting rather than endarterectomy. Our patient did well and had no complications from the procedure. Endovascular repair of symptomatic external carotid artery stenosis provides an alternative treatment method to conventional endarterectomy for patients with high surgical risk.
