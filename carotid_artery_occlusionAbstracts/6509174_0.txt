The antihypoxic effects of gutimine, piracetam, sodium hydroxybutyrate and lithium hydroxybityrate were studied on different models of brain hypoxia. All the drugs under study produced a remarkable antihypoxic effect in experimental asphyxic hypoxia, increasing brain resistance to oxygen deficiency and rapidly restituting brain function. Drug pretreatment of the animals with carotid artery occlusion raised the number of animals which survived 24 h after the operation. GABA salts appeared the most effective. Sodium hydroxybutyrate increased the lifespan of rats under histotoxic hypoxia.
