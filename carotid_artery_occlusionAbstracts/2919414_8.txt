Leukotrienes C4 and D4 are arachidonic acid metabolites that constrict blood vessels and enhance vascular permeability; their biosynthesis is initiated by the reaction of arachidonic acid with 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. After bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 15 minutes and reperfusion of the gerbil brain for 15 minutes, we determined the brain tissue concentrations of leukotrienes C4 and D4 by radioimmunoassay; they had increased from a baseline concentration of less than 1 to a mean +/- SEM concentration of 12.8 +/- 3.9 pmol/g brain. We also studied the effect of a flavonoid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor on leukotriene production in the reperfused gerbil brain. A water-soluble flavonoid (5-hexyloxy-3',4'-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone 4'-disodium phosphate) was administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg/kg body wt; 15 minutes later, both carotid arteries were occluded. The enhanced production of leukotrienes C4 and D4 in the reperfused brain was reduced by approximately 80% (from a mean +/- SEM of 12.8 +/- 3.9 to 2.2 +/- 1.3 pmol/g brain) in the presence of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. The flavonoid did not affect the production of prostaglandin D2, the concentration of which also increased in the reperfused ischemic brain.
