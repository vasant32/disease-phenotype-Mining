To locate the cerebellar-activated descending sympathetic pathways in the dog the fastigial nucleus (FN) was electrically stimulated in chloralose-anesthetized dogs while recording from sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Physiological interventions included lesions in the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) of the spinal cord, myelotomy, arterial pressure changes, bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries, and administration of clonidine. Multiunit activity at the T2 on T3 white ramus communicans was recorded on-line during rest and FN stimulation. Descending sympathetic activity (averaging 3.5 m/s) in the DLF was increased in response to FN stimulation but was significantly reduced by ipsilateral and eliminated by bilateral FN lesions. When testing for the effects of baroreceptor reflexes on the sympathetic pathway phenylephrine-induced hypertension decreased, but moderate hemorrhage increased the amount of preganglionic activity at rest and during FN stimulation. During hypertension and simultaneous carotid artery occlusion the amount of sympathetic activity that could be evoked was comparable to that evoked during normotensive states. Clonidine (IV) reduced the FN sympathoexcitation, but direct stimulation of the DLF indicated that clonidine had sympathoinhibitory activity at both medullary and spinal sites. In summary, rostral FN primarily excited ipsilateral descending sympathetic pathways in DLF, and this sympathoexcitation was partially inhibited by baroreceptor intervention.
