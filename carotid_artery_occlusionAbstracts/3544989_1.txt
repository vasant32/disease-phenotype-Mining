The differentiation of high-grade carotid artery stenosis from occlusion can be a difficult but important diagnostic dilemma. The authors used a combination of duplex scanning, pulsed spectrum analysis, audible analysis of continuous wave doppler signal, and peri-orbital doppler compressions to accurately differentiate high-grade stenosis from occlusion in a series of 24 patients.
