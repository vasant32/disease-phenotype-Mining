Mongolian gerbils were subjected to bilateral carotid artery occlusion, exposed to nesting material and examined daily. Five minutes of ischemia significantly reduced nesting behavior for 3 days; while 10 min attenuated nesting 6 days. Semi-novel re-exposure to nesting material also resulted in deficits. These disruptions in nesting behavior directly correlate to the amount of ischemic morphological damage and thus serve as a behavioral indicator of tissue damage.
