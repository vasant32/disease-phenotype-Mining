BACKGROUND: An 83-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension, and right-sided weakness. Her previous medical history was notable for hyperthyroidism and a curative remote mastectomy for breast cancer. The patient was on two antihypertensive medications and a statin, and she was not receiving any antiplatelet medication. She was taken by ambulance to a primary stroke center. Initial examination showed global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, right hemiplegia, and hemisensory loss. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, laboratory tests, noncontrast head CT scan, multimodal brain MRI scan, catheter cerebral angiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring. DIAGNOSIS: Acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion, with salvageable penumbral tissue and a persistent large-vessel occlusion. MANAGEMENT: Neuroprotective study agent (total dose of 20 g intravenous MgSO(4) or matched placebo), intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, rescue mechanical thrombectomy using the Merci clot retrieval device.
