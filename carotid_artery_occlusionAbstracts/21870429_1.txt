Stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability around the globe. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the protective effect of hesperidin and its nitric oxide mechanism against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 30 min followed by 24 h reperfusion was given to induce ischemia in rats. Animals were pretreated with hesperidin (50 and 100 mg/kg, po) for 7 days. Various behavioural tests, oxidative stress parameters, endogenous antioxidant system, antioxidant enzyme activity and mitochondrial enzyme complex (I, II, III and IV) dysfunctions in cortex and striatum were assessed subsequently. Hesperidin (50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly improved neurobehavioral alterations (neurological score, locomotor activity, resistance to lateral push and hanging wire latency), attenuated oxidative damage, restored antioxidant and mitochondrial complex enzyme activities in cortex and in striatum regions of the brain as compared to their respective controls. L-arginine (100 mg/kg) or L-NAME (10 mg/kg) pretreatment with lower dose of hesperidin (50 mg/kg) significantly reversed or potentiated its protective effect, respectively which was significant as compared to hesperidin (50 mg/kg). The results highlight the involvement of nitric oxide mechanism in the protective effect of hesperidin against ischemia reperfusion injury induced alterations.
