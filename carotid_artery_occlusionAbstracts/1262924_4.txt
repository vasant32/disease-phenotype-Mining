The authors describe a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to moyamoya disease in an adult Negro. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such case reported. Moyamoya, the Japanese word for "puff of smoke," describes the characteristic angiographic appearance of the collateral arterial network associated with internal carotid artery occlusion. The cause is unknown. Treatment consists of supportive care; the prognosis is variable.
