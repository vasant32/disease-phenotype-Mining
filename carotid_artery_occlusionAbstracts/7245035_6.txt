Ten patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia were found to have totally occluded internal carotid arteries with significant external carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Eight patients underwent external carotid endarterectomy, and two patients underwent saphenous vein bypass to the external carotid artery from the subclavian artery. Cerebral blood flow was measured with 133Xe in six patients preoperatively and in five postoperatively. Four of the six patients had diminished mean flow on the affected side, and three had diminished flow in the contralateral side. All patients had abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow. Postoperatively, all patients had significant improvement in mean blood flow on the side treated with operation (15% to 39%), and four had improvement of blood flow on the contralateral side (12% to 52%). All had improvement in regional cerebral blood flow. Nine of the 10 patients were relieved of their symptoms. One patient, despite improvement in cerebral blood flow, continued to have diminished cerebral flow and symptoms postoperatively. Subsequent extracranial-intracranial bypass relieved his symptoms and his cerebral blood flow returned to normal. Thus external carotid artery revascularization is effective in increasing total and regional cerebral blood flow and in relieving symptoms of internal carotid artery occlusion and external carotid stenosis. Cerebral blood flow measurement with 133Xe is useful in preoperative patient selection and objective assessment of operative results.
