BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective patient/control patient study was to determine perioperative risk and long-term benefits of carotid endarterectomy contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery were each paired with two control group patients (n = 74) undergoing carotid endarterectomy contralateral to a patent internal carotid artery. Patients preferentially underwent electroencephalographic monitoring, selective shunting, and patch angioplasty for vessel closure. RESULTS: The perioperative rate of stroke or death was 5% (n = 2) in the occluded group and 3% (n = 2) in the control group. Ninety-two percent of the occluded group and 96% of the control patients were stroke-free over a mean follow-up of 23.8 and 27.2 months, respectively. No statistical difference was noted between groups for perioperative rate of stroke or death (P = 0.60), mean stroke-free rates (P = 0.37), stroke rate by life-table analysis (P = 0.33), or survival by life-table analysis (P = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have carotid endarterectomy performed contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery showed no difference for perioperative stroke or death, late stroke, or survival.
