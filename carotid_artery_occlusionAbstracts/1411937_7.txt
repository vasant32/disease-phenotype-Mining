BACKGROUND: To determine the short- and long-term benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) contralateral to an occluded internal carotid (ICA), we reviewed our experience since 1976. METHODS: In 66 (13.8%) of 478 patients undergoing 544 CEAs, the contralateral ICA was occluded. Mean follow-up was 50.1 months (range, 1 to 165 months). Complete follow-up was available in 83.0% of patients. RESULTS: Operative death occurred in one (1.5%) of 66 patients with contralateral occlusion and six (1.3%) of 478 patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.99). Operative strokes occurred in two (3.0%) of 66 patients with contralateral occlusion and 14 (2.9%) of 478 without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.99). Life-table stroke-free rates at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years were 96.8%, 93.0%, and 93.0% in patients with contralateral occlusion and 95.9%, 94.2%, 91.1%, and 88.0% in patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.36). Five- and 8-year stroke-free rates were 100% and 100% in the asymptomatic subgroup with occlusion, 95.9% and 92.2% in the asymptomatic subgroup without occlusion (p = 0.45), 91.2% and 91.2% in the symptomatic subgroup with occlusion, and 89.7% and 86.8% in the symptomatic subgroup without occlusion (p = 0.47). Life-table survival rates at 5 and 8 years were 72.5% and 56.0% in patients with contralateral occlusion and 81.8% and 69.0% in patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: CEA performed in patients with and without symptoms with a contralateral ICA occlusion produces short- and long-term mortality and stroke morbidity rates comparable to those of similar patients without contralateral ICA occlusion. The indications for CEA in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion should not differ from those applied to patients without contralateral occlusion.
