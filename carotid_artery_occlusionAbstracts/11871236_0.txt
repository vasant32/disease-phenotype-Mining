Experiments on rats with occluded common carotid arteries showed that an excess sodium chloride consumption increased the loss of test animals as a result of the maximum decrease in the local cerebral blood flow and sharply pronounced brain swelling. The sodium chloride substitute hyposol (giposol) reduced the extent of cerebral ischemia and brain swelling effect and increased the renal perfusion and diuresis levels. In the test animals receiving a high-Na diet, the efficacy of cerebrolysine was less pronounced. In contrast, hyposol increased the antiischemic, saluretic and antiswelling effects of cerebrolysine under the carotid artery occlusion.
