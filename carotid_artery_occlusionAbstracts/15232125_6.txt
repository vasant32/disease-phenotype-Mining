BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic 17beta-estradiol (E2) replacement therapy in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats reduces leukocyte adhesion and brain damage after transient forebrain ischemia. Recently, we found that E2 treatment in diabetic OVX females was associated with enhanced postischemic neuropathology. We tested the hypothesis that in chronically hyperglycemic diabetic OVX females, chronic E2 replacement potentiates post-transient forebrain ischemia leukocyte adhesion. METHODS: Pial venules were observed through closed cranial windows. Adherence of rhodamine 6G-tagged leukocytes was monitored before and 10 hours after transient forebrain ischemia (20 minutes right common carotid artery occlusion plus hemorrhagic hypotension) in intact, untreated OVX and E2-treated OVX females rendered diabetic via streptozotocin. Leukocyte adhesion was quantitated as the percentage venular area occupied by adherent leukocytes. RESULTS: At 2 hours after transient forebrain ischemia, a similar low level of leukocyte adhesion was seen in the 3 groups (<3% of the venular area). Starting at approximately 4 hours after ischemia, leukocyte adhesion in the E2-treated OVX females rose to significantly higher levels compared with the other groups. Relative to the 2-hour value, the level of adhesion at 10 hours was 12.5-fold, 4-fold, and 5-fold greater in the E2-treated OVX, OVX, and intact groups, respectively. Leukocyte extravasation (beginning after 6 hours of reperfusion) was observed in a majority (64%) of the E2-treated animals, with limited or no extravasation seen in the intact or OVX groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that factors associated with diabetes and chronic hyperglycemia convert E2 from a counterinflammatory to a proinflammatory substance in an ischemic setting.
