Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) secondary to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is usually resistant to treatment. We report a case of NVG with ICA occlusion improved by intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection and carotid artery stent replacement (CAS), even though we did not perform panretinal photocoagulation. A 67-year-old male with NVG noted visual loss in his left eye. Magnetic resonance angiography showed left ICA occlusion. He was diagnosed with NVG secondary to ICA occlusion. The next day, we carried out IVB injection in his left eye, following which the iris and angle neovascularization regressed, and the intraocular pressure decreased to normal within a day after the injection. CAS was performed on his left ICA at a month post injection. Two months later, we reinjected bevacizumab in his left eye. His condition remained stable with no recurrence over two years. This case indicates that IVB injection and CAS are useful for early-stage NVG secondary to ICA occlusion.
