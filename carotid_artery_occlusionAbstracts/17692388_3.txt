The pre-clinical global ischemia model transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion addresses the unique cascade of events leading to delayed neuronal cell death. However, the inconsistent occurrence of posterior communicating arteries (PcomA) in mice might cause high outcome variability. To determine a means for reducing variability, CD1 mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 12-40 min. Occlusion duration> or =18 min was applied to mice with bilateral regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)> or =10% of baseline at 2.5 min of ischemia. However, only groups with ischemic duration< or =18 min were used for statistical analysis because of the high mortality in the other groups. After 7 days, patency of PcomA and hippocampal neuronal loss in the CA1 subfield were evaluated. Outcome variability was reduced when hemispheres containing PcomA were excluded from analysis; ischemic outcome was not affected by the presence of a contralateral PcomA. Extending ischemic duration based on rCBF did not reduce outcome variability because the initial rCBF could not reliably predict PcomA. Therefore, after an optimal ischemic duration, evaluating hippocampal injury in each hemisphere independently according to the existence of PcomA is an effective and reliable method to obtain consistent results in this pre-clinical mouse model.
