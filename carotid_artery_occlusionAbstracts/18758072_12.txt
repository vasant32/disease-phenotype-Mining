The present study was designed to investigate the possible role of opioids and K(ATP) channels in ischemic postconditioning-induced reversal of global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) induced neuronal injury. Mice were subjected to global ischemia by bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 10 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h, to produce neuronal injury. Ischemic postconditioning was induced by three episodes of carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion of 10 s each, immediately after global ischemia. Morphine postconditioning was induced by administration of morphine (5 mg/kg i.v.), 5 min prior to reperfusion. Naloxone (5 mg/kg i.v.), opioid receptor antagonist, and glibenclamide (5 mg/kg i.v.), K(ATP) channel blocker were administered 10 min before global ischemia. Extent of cerebral injury was assessed by measuring cerebral infarct size using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Short-term memory was evaluated using the elevated plus maze test, while degree of motor incoordination was evaluated using inclined beam-walking, rota-rod and lateral push tests. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion resulted in significant increase in infarct size, impairment in short-term memory and motor co-ordination. Ischemic/morphine postconditioning significantly attenuated I/R induced neuronal injury and behavioural alterations. Pretreatments with naloxone and glibenclamide attenuated the neuroprotective effects of ischemic/morphine postconditioning. It may be concluded that ischemic/morphine postconditioning protects I/R induced cerebral injury via activating opioid receptor and K(ATP) channel opening.
