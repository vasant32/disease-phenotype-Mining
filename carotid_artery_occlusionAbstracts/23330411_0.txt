Although inflammatory periodontal disease has been proven to be related to carotid intima media thickness, it has been recently suggested that even an alteration of carotid hemodynamics might contribute to atherosclerosis in patients with periodontal disease. A 52-year-old female patient was referred to periodontology department due to painful alveolar mucosa. On the basis of dental history, we concluded that the patient had a severe form of generalized aggressive periodontitis that led to complete edentulism. The patient was advised to undergo ultrasonography of carotid arteries with arterial stiffness measurements at neurology department. A diagnosis of the right internal carotid artery occlusion was established. Inflammatory periodontal disease may affect arterial hemodynamics and even lead to artery occlusion. It is advisable that patients with a severe form of periodontitis should be referred for carotid artery ultrasonography.
