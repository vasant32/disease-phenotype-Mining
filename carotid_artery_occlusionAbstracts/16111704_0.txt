Although unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion have been reported in the past, bilateral CCA occlusion is rare. The management and mechanism of unilateral CCA occlusion and bilateral ICA occlusion are debatable, but those of bilateral CCA occlusion are largely unknown. Herein, we present a case of bilateral CCA occlusion that had an acceptable outcome with medical treatment. The literature regarding unilateral CCA occlusion, bilateral ICA occlusion and bilateral CCA occlusion is also discussed. Experience implies that the collateral circulation gives rise to the clinical presentation, and may affect the outcome of various managements. Our review and case study may provide new information for future studies of carotid artery occlusion.
