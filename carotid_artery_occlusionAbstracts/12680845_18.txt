1. Rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) was used as a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model. We observed autoradiographically the long-term changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU) after 2 days and 1, 4 and 8 weeks of BCAO and in controls. Regions evaluated included the cerebral cortex, white matter and basal ganglia. Pathological changes were also observed with Kl√ºver-Barrera and haematoxylin-eosin staining. 2. After 2 days, rCBF was significantly reduced to 33-58% in the cortex, white matter and amygdala and similar reductions were observed after 1 week. 3. After 4 weeks, rCBF recovered; however, rCBF remained significantly reduced in the occipital cortex, white matter, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. 4. After 2 days, rCGU was mostly maintained but, after 1 week, rCGU was reduced significantly to 40-70% in the cortex, white matter, basal ganglia and thalamus. Four weeks later, these reductions were no longer seen. 5. Rarefaction of the white matter was observed from 1 week. 6. These results showed that the BCAO in rats is an appropriate model for chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and that uncoupling of rCBF and rCGU was observed from 2 days until 4 weeks in the white matter.
