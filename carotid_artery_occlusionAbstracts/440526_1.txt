A case of internal carotid artery occlusion due to attempted hanging was reported. This 51-year-old man, who failed in suicidal hanging, remained in right hemiplegia and total aphasia. Left carotid arteriogram revealed complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery approximately 1 cm distal to its origin. Surgical exposure of the internal carotid artery was performed 4 weeks after the attempted hanging. The occlusive portion was percutaneously injured by ligature, whereby there was a horizontal breach of intima, media and adventitia at the level of the ligature. The damaged arterial wall was resected, and a reconstructive vascular surgery in the neck was performed. But postoperative arteriogram showed an unsatisfactory result. Pathogenesis of traumatic involvements of the internal carotid artery was discussed with literature. Also it was discussed that internal carotid artery occlusion was a very important factor causing death in suicidal hanging.
