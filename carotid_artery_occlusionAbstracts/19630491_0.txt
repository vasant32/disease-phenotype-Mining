The authors report the case of an acute left middle cerebral artery distribution stroke caused by a terminal internal carotid artery occlusion in a patient who underwent endovascular mechanical embolectomy. Histopathological analysis of embolic material obtained from the mechanical retriever device was diagnostic of a high-grade phyllodes breast tumor. This case represents the first instance, to our knowledge, of tumor embolus extraction via mechanical retrieval during acute ischemic stroke intervention.
