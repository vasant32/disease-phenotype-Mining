 OBJECTIVE: Comprehension of the pathophysiologic characteristics of atherosclerosis has focused its attention on the study of dynamic and metabolic processes involving the vessel wall as possible causes of stroke. When compared with conventional radiologic techniques, sonography has the main advantage of being a real-time imaging modality. We report 2 acute stroke cases in which carotid sonography showed some dynamic features that could not be identified with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). METHODS: Carotid sonography with high-resolution probes (9-14 MHz) was compared with CT and MRA findings showing carotid axis occlusion in 2 patients with acute stroke. RESULTS: In case 1, the internal carotid artery occlusion observed on CT and MRA was interpreted as a dissection on a clinical basis, but sonography showed a mobile embolus originating from the heart in the internal carotid artery. In case 2, the occlusion of the whole carotid axis observed on CT and MRA was instead related to a heart-originating embolus floating in the common carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of dynamic aspects of atherosclerosis is fundamental to understanding the pathophysiologic characteristics of stroke. Sonography is fundamental in carotid artery imaging for its possibility of showing dynamic processes that could be misdiagnosed with "static" imaging. The correct identification of the pathophysiologic characteristics of stroke in these cases could have led to different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms.
