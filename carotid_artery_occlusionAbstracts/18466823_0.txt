Most patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion have a single minor or major hemispheric stroke. A minority of patients have ipsilateral retinal ischemia, recurrent strokes, or transient ischemic attacks. Whereas spontaneous carotid recanalization is rare, acute surgical recanalization has been attempted, with mixed results. Recently, acute endovascular recanalization has been performed and described as feasible and relatively safe. We describe a patient with symptom recurrence related to hemodynamic factors after occlusion of the carotid artery who was successfully treated 14 days after symptom onset.
