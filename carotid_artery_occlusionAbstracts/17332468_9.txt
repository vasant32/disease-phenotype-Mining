BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamic compromise due to occlusive cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increased stroke risk. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been suggested to stimulate collateral blood vessel growth in various models of hemodynamic compromise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of GM-CSF on cerebral hemodynamics and vessel growth in a rat model of chronically impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sequential bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCO) and were treated with GM-CSF or saline for 6 weeks. Sham-occluded animals served as a control group. Baseline CBF was measured by iodo[(14)C]antipyrine autoradiography, and cerebrovascular reserve capacity was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry after application of 20 mg/kg body weight acetazolamide. The capillary density and arterioles immunopositive for alpha-smooth muscle actin were counted on brain sections. The cerebral angioarchitecture was visualized with a latex perfusion technique. RESULTS: Baseline CBF as measured by iodo[(14)C]antipyrine autoradiography was not affected by BCO. The cerebrovascular reserve capacity, however, was significantly impaired 1 week after BCO. CBF and cerebrovascular reserve capacity recovered completely in GM-CSF-treated animals but not in solvent-treated animals. Histologic analysis of the hippocampus revealed integrity of the hypoxia-vulnerable neurons in all animals. The capillary density showed a very mild increase in GM-CSF-treated animals. However, the number of intraparenchymal and leptomeningeal arterioles was significantly higher in GM-CSF-treated animals than in both other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term GM-CSF treatment in a BCO model in rats leads to restoration of impaired cerebral hemodynamics and accompanies structural changes in the resistance-vessel network.
