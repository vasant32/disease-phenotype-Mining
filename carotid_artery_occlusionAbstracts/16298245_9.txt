Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to determine region-specific metabolic changes in young and aged animals subjected to a long-term hypoxic-ischemic injury. Focal ischemia, which was studied as an experimental stroke model, was induced in 3- and 24-month-old rats by unilateral common carotid artery occlusion associated with 24 h of hypoxia. Eight metabolites were quantified from extracts in three different brain regions (hippocampus, frontoparietal and occipital cortices) from both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Our findings showed significant differences in lactate and myo-inositol concentration values in the hippocampus of the aged rats as compared to the same area of the young adult group under normoxic conditions. After hypoxia-ischemia (HI), the most relevant changes in metabolite concentrations were found in the hippocampal region of both young and aged groups as compared to their age-matched controls. Of the three brain areas under investigation, the hippocampus proved to be particularly susceptible to the prolonged hypoxia-ischemia perturbation. The effects were more evident in the aged animals.
