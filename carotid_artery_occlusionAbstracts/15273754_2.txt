The ratio of low-activity and high-activity rats differed in autumn, winter, and spring litters. Initially more intensive cerebral blood flow in low-active rats and its more pronounced decrease after common carotid artery occlusion determined their higher sensitivity to cerebral ischemia (compared to high-activity animals). After 18-h immobilization stress cerebral blood flow decreased by 10-15%, which abolished the difference in the individual resistance to cerebral ischemia. Independently on emotional resistance, cerebral ischemia was not accompanied by the development of collateral blood flow in the acute period and caused death of 90% rats.
