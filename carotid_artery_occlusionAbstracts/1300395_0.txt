The internal carotid artery occlusion causing an insufficiency of the cerebral circulation manifests itself--besides the neurological symptoms--by disorders of the visual organ. One can distinguish among them early, functional symptoms in the form of transient unilateral hemianopia on the side opposite to the occluded carotid artery and the attacks of transient amblyopia. Signs of fixed ischaemia of the eye ball appear afterwards in the form of oculomotor and pupillary disturbances, neovascularization of the iris, disturbances of the IOP, central retinal artery occlusion, ischaemic optic atrophy. The authors emphasize the value of Doppler's diagnostic ultrasonography, a fast and non-invasive method of direct evaluation of the blood flow in the internal carotid artery system.
