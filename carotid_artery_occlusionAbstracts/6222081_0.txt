Partial or complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery is a familiar consequence of severe atherosclerosis seen in the elderly. Complete obstruction of both internal carotids is rare, particularly in the young or middle-aged. The rapid onset of bilateral internal carotid occlusion would be expected to produce devastating neurological sequelae and probably not be compatible with survival. We present a case of a young man with complete obstruction of both internal carotid arteries whose presenting symptoms were those of a visual field cut. The history suggests that the carotid occlusion occurred as a result of blunt trauma. The patient had no known predisposition to vascular abnormalities (no history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, signs of systematic arteriosclerosis or vasculitis, and an unremarkable family history for vascular abnormalities). Computerized tomography revealed an infarct in his right parietal lobe. Angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of both internal carotid arteries and the right posterior communicating artery and failed to disclose the development of extensive collatorals, adding further evidence to the acuteness of the occlusion. The patient was followed by noninvasive studies and in the subsequent year showed marked neurological and ophthalmological improvement.
