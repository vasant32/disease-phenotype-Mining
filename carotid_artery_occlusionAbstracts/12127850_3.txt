OBJECTIVE: to evaluate early and mid-term term results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patient with and without contralateral carotid occlusion. METHODS: between 1996 and 1999, 1324 CEAs were performed. In 82 patients contralateral carotid artery occlusion was present (group I); 1242 patients had patent contralateral carotid (group II). All patients were operated under general anaesthesia, and selective shunting was based on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Ultrasonographic follow-up was performed at 1, 6 and 12 months and then once a year. Early results and follow-up data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: in group I there was a significantly higher incidence of SEPs reduction and shunt insertion; however, there were no differences in terms of perioperative complications. The cumulative stroke and death rate at 30 days in group 1 and group 2 were 2.4% vs 1.4% (p=n.s.), respectively. At a mean follow-up of 15 months there were no differences between the two groups in terms of cumulative symptom-free survival. CONCLUSIONS:the presence of contralateral carotid occlusion caused an increased use of shunt, but not in early complications rates.
