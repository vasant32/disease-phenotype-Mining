We evaluated the effect of brovincamine on the circulatory and metabolic state in the brain ischemia with internal carotid artery occlusion accompanying the 'misery perfusion syndrome'. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured by PET before and after intravenous loading of brovincamine. Brovincamine increased CBF and decreased OEF significantly on the occluded side of the hemisphere. CMRO2 did not show any remarkable changes upon brovincamine administration. It was concluded that brovincamine might be useful for increasing the hemodynamic reserve, but did not affect the metabolic state immediately after its administration.
