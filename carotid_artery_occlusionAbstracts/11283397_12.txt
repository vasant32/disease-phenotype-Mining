BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Age-dependent changes in T2-weighted MR images have been reported in cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. However, the biophysical mechanisms responsible for the image changes remain poorly defined. We investigated whether cerebral hypoxia-ischemia-induced T2 changes correlate with alterations in either water content or protein extravasation. METHODS:One- and 4-week-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion plus hypoxia in 8% oxygen. T2 images were acquired before, during, and 1 or 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia. Blood-brain barrier disruption and brain edema were evaluated by immunohistological detection of IgG extravasation and measurement of water content by dry-wet weight and specific gravity methods. RESULTS: In 1-week-old rats, T2 values, areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere increased during hypoxia-ischemia, recovered at 1 hour after hypoxia-ischemia, and increased again at 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia. Extravasation of IgG occurred during hypoxia-ischemia and remained detectable 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia. In 4-week-old rats, an increase in T2 or extravasation of IgG did not occur until 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia despite a comparable elevation in water content during and soon after hypoxia-ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: T2 imaging appears reliable for detecting edema associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier but not necessarily an increase in cerebral water or plasma proteins alone. The different hypoxic-ischemic changes in T2 in immature and older brain are associated with differences in alterations in water content plus extravasation of protein, consistent with age-dependent differences in hypoxic-ischemic alterations in vascular permeability.
