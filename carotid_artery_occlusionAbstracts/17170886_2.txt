Precise angiographic evaluation of the cerebrovascular system and radiographically controlled balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery have considerably changed the risk involved with carotid surgery at the skull base. Preoperative permanent balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery was used in three patients with infiltrative carotid body tumors. Embolization and definitive preoperative control of the carotid artery provided ideal conditions for focusing the surgeon's attention on radical removal of tumor with maximal functional preservation of the adjacent cranial nerves.
