Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery has been considered a relatively rare cause of carotid artery occlusion. It is postulated this condition may not be uncommon and that some cases are not recognised. The condition is characterised by typical clinical and radiological features which should suggest the diagnosis. Despite these suggestive features it appears that recognition of this condition is not widespread and the diagnosis may not be made. Three cases of spontaneous dissection are reported. The clinical and radiological features will be emphasised and pathogenesis and treatment discussed.
