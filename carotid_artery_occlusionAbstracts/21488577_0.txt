 OBJECTIVES: We report a case of an eustachian tube melanoma treated by a double surgical approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 56-year-old man consulted for a recurrent left serous otitis media. RESULTS: CT-scan and MRI showed a lesion filling completely the middle ear, extending along the Eustachian tube up to the nasopharynx, with enhancement after injection. The biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. After left internal carotid artery occlusion, the removal of the lesion was performed by a double surgical approach: combination of an endoscopic transnasal and a retroauricular approach. Radiotherapy was adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: Eustachian tube melanoma is a rare occurrence. Surgical treatment must be radical, what represents a challenge considering the localization; it can be obtained with the double surgical approach proposed in our case report.
