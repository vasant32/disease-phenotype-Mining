Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (15 min.) followed by two hours of recirculation reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, and increased susceptibility of mitochondrial membranes to in vitro lipid peroxidation in brain regions (i.e., cortex, striatum and hippocampus) of Mongolian gerbil. Intraperitoneal bolus injection (2 mg/kg b.w.) of liposome-entrapped CuZn superoxide dismutase (1-SOD) increased the endogenous SOD activity in normal brain tissue and, when given at the end of ischemia, counteracted both the ischemic reduction of endogenous SOD and the increased peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes. 1-SOD treatment was ineffective in reducing brain swelling, suggesting that superoxide radicals are not a main participant in the process of (post)ischemic brain edema formation.
