The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of prostaglandins in the changes in myocardial function and peripheral and coronary vascular resistance which accompany a generalized increase in sympathetic tone caused by carotid baroreflex unloading in the anesthetized dog. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCO) with heart rate held constant by electrical pacing (150 beats/min) resulted in increases in systolic, (33%) diastolic (40%), and mean (35%) arterial pressures, LV systolic pressure (33%) and left ventricular (LV) dP/dt (37%). After blockade of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin (N = 11) or meclofenamate (N = 6) the increases in systolic (41%), diastolic (45%), and mean (41%) arterial pressures, LV systolic pressure (39%), LV dP/dt (52%), and cardiac work caused by BCO were significantly greater, in spite of the initially higher baseline values (11-18%) following the administration of the drugs. In contrast, the changes in circumflex coronary blood flow and coronary vascular resistance to BCO were essentially the same before and after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Systemic prostaglandin synthesis may, therefore, play a significant role in the control of systemic arterial pressure and myocardial function, most probably by modulating the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve terminals, without adversely affecting coronary blood flow regulation.
