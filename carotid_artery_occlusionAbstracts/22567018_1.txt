The external carotid artery (ECA) is one of the most important extracranial-to-intracranial sources of collateral circulation, contributing significantly to the cerebral blood flow especially when perfusion through the internal carotid artery (ICA) is compromised. Most of the endovascular studies so far have been dedicated to ICA, with little focus on the ECA. Limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are a relatively rare manifestation of carotid artery disease that may present with repetitive shaking movements of the affected limbs. We report a case of an 80-year-old male with bilateral internal and contralateral external carotid artery occlusion who developed limb-shaking TIAs as a result of significant stenosis of the right ECA. Percutaneous revascularization of the ECA was performed by angioplasty and stenting. At the follow-up 12 months later, the patient remained neurologically intact with complete resolution of his symptoms. Stenting of the ECA should be considered as a reasonable alternative to conventional open repair especially in patients with contralateral carotid stenosis, insufficient circle of Willis, and significant comorbidities.
