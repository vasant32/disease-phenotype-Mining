BACKGROUND: The aim of this article was to analyze the perioperative mortality and stroke risk rates and late benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CE) contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA), on the basis of our surgical experience from July 1990 to June 1996. METHODS: In 57 (14.7%) of 336 patients undergoing 388 CEs, the contralateral ICA was occluded (group I). All operations were performed under general anesthesia with selective shunting based on electroencephalographic criteria. Shunting was used in 36 (63.1%) of 57 revascularizations in group I and 47 (14.2%) of 331 operations performed on the remaining 279 patients with patent contralateral ICAs (group II) (p < 0.001). RESULTS: Perioperative strokes occurred in two patients (3.5%) in group I and three patients (1%) in group II (difference not significant). The only perioperative death, which occurred in one patient (1.7%) in group I, was the result of a perioperative stroke; two patients (0.7%) in group II died within 30 days of operation (difference not significant). Life-table cumulative stroke-free rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95%, 95%, 95% in group I and 98.8%, 98.2%, and 98.2% in group II, respectively (p = 0.272). Life-table cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.5%, 94.2%, and 78.1% in group I and 99.2%, 94.8%, and 71.7% in group II, respectively (p = 0.306). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that CE contralateral to an occluded ICA can be performed with acceptable perioperative mortality and stroke risk rates and late stroke-free and survival rates comparable to those seen in patients without contralateral ICA occlusion who have undergone operation. Nevertheless, we think it is misleading to imply that the risks of operating on the two groups are the same. Moreover, because no late stroke-related death occurred in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion, it would appear that superior late stroke-free rates did not translate into a prolonged survival advantage.
