The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of water protons and the cross-relaxation time (TIS) between irradiated protein protons and observed water protons were measured in order to study water-macromolecular interactions in ischemic rat brain tissues. Tissues were obtained by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Water, Na, and K contents were measured in ischemic brain tissue at the same time. Water and Na content increased while the TIS value and K content decreased following ischemic insults. The T1 value did not change until 180 min after ischemia had been induced. Changes in the TIS value occurred earlier than changes observed for the T1 value, water, and electrolyte contents. Results indicate that the value of TIS may be useful for detecting cerebral ischemia and that the physical structure of water-macromolecular interaction may be altered soon after ischemic onset in brain tissue.
