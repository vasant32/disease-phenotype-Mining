BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus may impair endothelium-dependent responses in cerebral arterioles. The basilar artery dilates in response to increases in blood flow. The goal of this study was to examine effects of diabetes mellitus on "flow-mediated" and endothelium-dependent dilatation of the basilar artery. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in rats with 50 mg/kg streptozotocin. Six months later, vessel diameter and velocity of blood flow through the basilar artery were measured using a cranial window in anesthetized rats under baseline conditions and during occlusion of the carotid arteries. Changes in vessel diameter were also measured during topical application of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. RESULTS: With aortic pressure maintained at baseline levels, blood flow velocity through the basilar artery increased similarly in control and diabetic rats during unilateral common carotid artery occlusion and during bilateral occlusion. In control and diabetic rats, diameter of the basilar artery increased by 10 +/- 2% and 10 +/- 4% during unilateral occlusion and by 27 +/- 5% and 31 +/- 4% during bilateral occlusion, respectively. Thus, diabetes did not impair flow-mediated dilatation of the basilar artery. In contrast, dilatation in response to 10(-5) M topical acetylcholine was less in diabetic rats (13 +/- 2%) than in control rats (45 +/- 8%) (p less than 0.05). Dilator responses to nitroprusside were not impaired by diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that diabetes produces impairment of endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine, but not flow-mediated dilatation, in the basilar artery.
