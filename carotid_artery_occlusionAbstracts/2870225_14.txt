In patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease the rise in middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood-flow velocity in response to hypercapnia, recorded with a pulsed transcranial doppler velocimeter, was significantly less in MCAs above a totally occluded carotid artery than in MCAs above a patent carotid. These findings support the existence of compensatory cerebral vasodilatation above a carotid occlusion and suggest that transient ischaemic attacks in patients with carotid occlusion may be flow-related rather than embolic phenomena. These patients may therefore benefit from extracranial-intracranial surgical revascularisation. The method presented is non-invasive and therefore ideally suited for use as a screening test or in follow-up studies.
