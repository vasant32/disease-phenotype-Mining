We elucidate the amplification phenomenon of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) induced in cats by cerebral ischemia and also analyse the relationship between such amplification and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Transient focal cerebral ischemia was carried out by inducing only middle cerebral artery occlusion or jointly with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Various SEP alteration patterns were observed with CBF changes; with our overall results suggesting for the first time that the SEP amplification phenomenon occurs only under relatively mild cerebral ischemia.
