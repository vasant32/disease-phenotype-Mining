A 69-year-old man experienced left hemiparesis and confusion of sudden onset, followed by complete spontaneous recovery after about 20 minutes. When carotid ultrasound was performed in the neurovascular unit 12 hours later, an occluded right internal carotid artery was found. Transcranial ultrasound showed normal flow in the right middle and anterior cerebral arteries. How should he be treated?
