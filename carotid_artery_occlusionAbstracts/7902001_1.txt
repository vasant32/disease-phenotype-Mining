In this study, we determined if aerobic exercise training alters adrenergic or pressure-dependent vascular regulation in the rat hindlimb or intestine. Pressor responses to bilateral carotid artery occlusion and systemic phenylephrine (PE) infusion were not altered by training. During occlusion, peak and steady-state changes in hindlimb vascular resistance (HLR) were significantly greater in trained (24 and 13%) than in sedentary (8 and -3%) rats; a similar trend existed for intestinal vascular resistance (IR). The pressure-dependent contribution was consistent between groups (HLR: peak 55-85%, steady state 25-45%; IR: peak and steady state 40-65%). During PE infusion, increases in IR and HLR were similar between groups. The increase in HLR was substantially pressure dependent in both groups (approximately 50% at highest dose) as was the change in IR in trained rats. However, the IR response to PE was not pressure dependent in sedentary rats. The direct effects of PE were similar between sedentary and trained rats in the hindlimb but were suppressed in the intestine of trained rats compared with sedentary rats. Therefore, aerobic exercise training altered adrenergic and pressure-dependent vasoregulatory mechanisms in both skeletal muscle and intestinal tissues.
