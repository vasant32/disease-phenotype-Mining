The resting heart rate was monitored in 50 urethane-anaesthetized (387 +/- 54 beats/min) and 4 conscious (341 +/- 39 beats/min) ferrets. The arterial blood pressure in the anaesthetized animals was 140/110 +/- 35/31 mmHg. The circulatory responses to vagal stimulation, carotid artery occlusion and a variety of humoral agents were examined. The vagal innervation of the heart and of the distribution of the great vessels are described.
