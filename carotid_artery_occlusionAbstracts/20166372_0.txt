Visual loss is a devastating complication of non-ophthalmic surgery. It is documented following cardiac, spinal, and transplant surgery. Patients with carotid artery occlusion are at increased risk for ocular ischaemia. Pre-operative assessment as well as early diagnosis and treatment is essential in cases of high-risk patients.
