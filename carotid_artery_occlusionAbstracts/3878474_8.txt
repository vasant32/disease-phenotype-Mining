This paper reviews the advances provided by positron emission tomography in the understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemic disorders in humans. The main focuses are on the evaluation of tissue integrity in recent stroke, distant metabolic effects of circumscribed vascular lesions, and hemodynamic consequences of internal carotid artery occlusion.
