OBJECTIVE: Acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) can lead the massive cerebral hemispheric infarction and cause massive cerebral edema and may result in tentorial herniation and death. The mortality rate is estimated at 80% with maximum conservative medical treatment. We have performed external decompression associated with anterior and medial temporal lobectomy (AMTL) as internal decompression for lifesaving. This study evaluated our surgical results and gives an analysis of the prognostic factors. METHODS: Twenty one consecutive patients with massive cerebral infarction caused by internal carotid artery occlusion who underwent external decompression associated with AMTL for lifesaving between June 2000 and December 2005 were included in this retrospective analysis. Survivors were divided into two functional groups at three months after surgery: good (Barthel index; BI> or =50) and poor (B1<50). The characteristics of the two groups were compared using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 11 males and 10 females aged from 28 to 81 years with a mean age of 65.0+/-11.6 years. Eight patients had an infarction restricted to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, others had additional anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarctions. The mean time between stroke onset and operation was 43.5+/-30 hours and ranged from 7 to 148 hours. Two patients died, so the mortality was 9.5%. Elderly patients (> or =60 years) (P=0.038), high preoperative Japan coma scale (> or =3 digit) (P=0.013), low preoperative Glasgow coma scale (GCS<8) (P=0.044), and multiple arterial territory (MCA+ACA or PCA) infarction (P=0.045) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. CONCLUSION: External decompression associated with AMTL can immediately relieve peduncle compression and could be effective in preserving life as effectively as "early" external decompression.
