The threshold of the relation between regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral protein synthesis was investigated in gerbils submitted to a 1-hour occlusion of the left common carotid artery. Blood flow was measured with [131I]iodoantipyrine and protein synthesis with [14C]leucine using double-tracer autoradiography and trichloroacetic acid wash-incubation for removal of nonincorporated tracer radioactivity. Specific activity of blood and brain leucine and [14C]leucine incorporation into brain proteins was also measured by conventional high-performance liquid chromatography to validate the autoradiographic approach. In control gerbils, gray matter blood flow ranged between 180 and 220 ml/100 g/min and fractional amino acid incorporation was approximately 80%. Unilateral carotid artery occlusion resulted in graded ischemia with blood flow between 10 and 100 ml/100 g/min. Regional cerebral protein synthesis gradually declined at blood flows of less than 100 ml/100 g/min and approached 0 at a blood flow of 40 ml/100 g/min. This threshold for complete suppression of protein synthesis is much higher than that for maintenance of tissue energy state and suggests that the size of an infarct after focal ischemia is determined by the suppression of protein synthesis rather than by the breakdown of energy metabolism.
