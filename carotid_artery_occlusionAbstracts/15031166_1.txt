AIM: To evaluate the risk factors for rubeosis iridis by colour Doppler imaging (CDI) in patients with complete internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO). METHODS: 34 eyes of 32 consecutive patients with complete ICAO were enrolled. Using CDI, blood flow direction (forward, reverse, undetectable) in the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA), and short posterior ciliary artery (SPCA) were determined. Arterial mean blood velocity (Vmean) and resistive index (RI) were calculated and correlations between the rubeosis iridis incidence and CDI parameters analysed. RESULTS: The eyes were classified into four types according to blood flow direction: forward flow in OA, CRA, and SPCA (type 1; n = 11); reverse OA and forward CRA and SPCA flow (type 2a; n = 12); reverse OA and undetectable CRA and SPCA flow (type 2b; n = 8); undetectable flow in all three arteries (type 3; n = 3). Rubeosis iridis was seen only in type 2b and 3 eyes. Type 2b showed significantly (p<0.01) higher Vmean and lower RI values in the OA, indicating more rapid reverse flow than in type 2a eyes. Although in type 1 and 2a eyes OA flow was in opposite directions, they manifested no rubeosis iridis and no difference in the Vmean and RI values of the CRA and SPCA. CONCLUSIONS: The classification of eyes from patients with ICAO into four types by CDI may facilitate the identification of the eyes at high risk for rubeosis iridis. Markedly diminished flow in both the CRA and SPCA may result in rubeosis iridis, regardless of OA flow direction.
