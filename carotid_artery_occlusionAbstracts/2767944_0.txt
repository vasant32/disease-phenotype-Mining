We studied 7 patients with internal carotid occlusion following spontaneous arterial dissection. All presented strokes, in one associated with Horner's syndrome. The doppler examination showed carotid occlusion, but only angiography established the diagnosis of vascular disease. Spontaneous recanalization was observed in 6 cases, treated only by antiplatelet drugs.
