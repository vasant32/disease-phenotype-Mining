Vascular reconstruction was attempted in 109 patients with carotid artery occlusion or stenosis. The follow-up on those with restored or improved flow was as long as nine years (average: two and one-half years).Arteriographic demonstration of lesions is mandatory. Complications were reduced by pre-arteriographic administration of anticoagulants and retrograde brachial arteriographic techniques.Although patients with stenosis are the best candidates, an attempt to restore flow in occluded vessels is warranted in all patients, except those with advanced disease or those who are drowsy and hemiplegic. Flow was restored in two-thirds of those who underwent early operation (under three days) and in one-quarter of those undergoing late operation. Even late operation restored flow in five of nine patients who presented with transient ischemic attacks.IN COMPLETED STROKES, OPERATION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO PATIENTS WITH: (1) minor strokes, (2) extensive strokes of short duration, and (3) extensive strokes of longer duration but with a worth-while outlook.When flow was restored or improved, symptoms were arrested in 93% of patients with transient ischemia, and at follow-up this result was maintained in 86%. Symptoms were arrested in 83% of those with strokes in evolution, and this was maintained at follow-up.Reconstruction combined with anticoagulant therapy of limited duration appears to be the optimal method of treatment.
