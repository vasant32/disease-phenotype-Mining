Acute ischemic stroke attributable to cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is frequently associated with severe disability or death and is usually caused by atherosclerosis. By contrast, the cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion is rare, and feasibility of urgent recanalization remains unclear. We present the first study in the literature that focuses on urgent open embolectomy for the treatment of cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion. A retrospective review of the charts for patients undergoing open embolectomy was performed. Between April 2006 and September 2007, 640 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke were treated. Of them, three patients (0.47%) with the acute complete cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion underwent urgent open embolectomy. All patients presented with profound neurological deficits and atrial fibrillation. The urgent open embolectomy achieved complete recanalization in all patients without any complications. All emboli in three patients were very large and fibrinous in histological findings. Two of three patients showed rapid improvement in neurological functions after surgical treatments. The cardioembolic occlusion of the cervical ICA is rare, but its possibility should be considered in patients with acute ischemic stroke suffering profound neurological deficits and atrial fibrillation. Urgent open embolectomy may be a treatment option to obtain successful recanalization for cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion and is recommended because it is technically easier and similar to carotid endarterectomy.
