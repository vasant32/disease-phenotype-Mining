INTRODUCTION: Since 1966 when Levine and Payan observed that the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) was unusually susceptible to cerebral infarction following occlusion of one or both common carotid arteries, the model has been used for the experimental study of cerebral ischemia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of anterior-posterior arterial communication in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 26 animals were used and divided in the following groups: 1. Bilateral carotid ligation (n = 10); 2. Unilateral left carotid ligation (n = 5); 3. Unilateral carotid right carotid ligation (n = 5); and 4. Control group without carotid ligation (n = 6). RESULTS: Postmortem intra-aortic dye injection demonstrated communication between anterior and posterior cerebral arteries in 30% of gerbils that previously were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. A number of vessels, between 8.95-11.35 microns in diameter, were linking the basilar artery with the posterior cerebral artery. In the remaining animals, the absence of communication was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Communicating carotid-basilar in lower number of cases and anastomosis the smallest diameter to give the gerbil advantage on others species as model of experimental regional ischemia.
