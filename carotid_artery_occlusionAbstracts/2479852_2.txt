Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with 133xenon inhalation and single photon emission computed tomography in 33 cases of internal carotid artery occlusion, in the resting state and 25 minutes after acetazolamide (Diamox) administration. The patient population consisted of 24 males and nine females with a mean age of 57 years, who presented with transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, and CBF increases as a result of dilatation of cerebral arteries due to CO2 accumulation. The mean CBF was 46 ml/100/g/min on the affected hemisphere and 56 ml/100/g/min on the unaffected hemisphere. The mean CBF value obtained by the same method in 10 normal volunteers was 55 ml/100/g/min. Thus, in the patients, CBF decreased on the affected side. The average increase in CBF after acetazolamide administration was 9% on the affected side and 17% on the unaffected side. The average increase in 10 normal volunteers was 32%. The reduced cerebral arterial reactivity to acetazolamide administration was bilateral in the patient group, which suggests that the cerebral arteries were dilated in order to maintain normal CBF. Extra-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery was performed in nine patients. Preoperatively, the mean CBF was 48 ml/100 g/min on the affected side and 57 ml/100 g/min on the unaffected side; the postoperative CBF was 48 ml/100 g/min on the affected side and 56 ml/100 g/min on the unaffected side. Thus, there was no notable change in CBF on either side after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
