The effects of hypothermia on production of nitric oxide (NO) in ischemic brain were investigated by using in vivo microdialysis. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups; saline-treated normothermic group (37 degreesC, n=6), 30 mg/kg N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester(l-NAME)-treated normothermic group (n=6), and saline-treated hypothermic group (30 degreesC, n=6). Transient forebrain ischemia was produced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion combined with hypotension (MABP=50 mmHg). Saline-treated normothermic animals resulted in a reduction of LCBF to 9% of baseline. Saline-treated hypothermic rats revealed the similar changes of LCBF. In contrast, l-NAME administration reduced the basal CBF to 85% of saline-treated group and to 8% after ischemia. NO products were decreased during ischemia and transiently increased after reperfusion in saline-treated groups. However, the increase of NO products after reperfusion was less significant in the hypothermia. l-NAME-treated group showed a constant reduction of NO production during ischemia and after reperfusion.
