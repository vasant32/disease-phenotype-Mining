The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, MK-801, has been reported to prevent or attenuate ischemic brain damage in various animal models. In halothane-anesthetized gerbils it was found that an optimal dose of MK-801 (3.0 mg/kg) for providing cerebral protection also produced hypothermia (31.1 +/- 0.62 degrees C) relative to control animals (34.2 +/- 0.77 degrees C, P less than 0.01). This degree of hypothermia alone was sufficient to provide complete histological and functional protection (spatial memory) against 5 min of carotid artery occlusion. In gerbils made ischemic, but maintained at normal body temperature, a dose of 3.0 mg/kg of MK-801 provided no protection against hippocampal cell loss or spatial memory impairment. These data suggest that the protective actions of MK-801 may be due entirely to drug-induced hypothermia.
