13 patients under 40 years of age had cerebral infarction and angiographic evidence of arterial stenosis or occlusion. None of them had cardiac disorders prone to cerebral embolism. Five patients had occlusion at the origin of the internal carotid artery, one had occlusion of the common carotid artery and one each had stenosis at the origin of the internal carotid and common carotid arteries, respectively. Two patients had unilateral occlusion of the supraclinoid portion of the carotid artery with basal collaterals that had some resemblance to the Moyamoya disease. Three patients demonstrated stenosis or occlusion of the middle and/or anterior cerebral arteries. Three patients had hypercholesterolemia, one of whom was hypertensive. None had confirmed diabetes mellitus. One female, who died, had taken oral contraceptives for 3 years. A male, with internal carotid artery occlusion, had serological evidence for syphilis.
