A delayed or secondary energy failure occurs during recovery from perinatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. The question remains as to whether the energy failure causes or accentuates the ultimate brain damage or is a consequence of cell death. To resolve the issue, 7-day postnatal rats underwent unilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed thereafter by systemic hypoxia with 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours. During recovery, the brains were quick frozen and individually processed for histology and the measurements of 1) high-energy phosphate reserves and 2) neuronal (MAP-2, SNAP-25) and glial (GFAP) proteins. Phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP, initially depleted during hypoxia-ischemia, were partially restored during the first 18 hours of recovery, with secondary depletions at 24 and 48 hours. During the initial recovery phase (6 to 18 hours), there was a significant correlation between PCr and the histology score (0 to 3), but not for ATP. During the late recovery phase, there was a highly significant correlation between all measured metabolites and the damage score. Significant correlation also exhibited between the neuronal protein markers, MAP-2 and SNAP-25, and PCr as well as the sum of PCr and Cr at both phases of recovery. No correlation existed between the high-energy reserves and the glial protein marker, GFAP. The close correspondence of PCr to histologic brain damage and the loss of MAP-2 and SNAP-25 during both the early and late recovery intervals suggest evolving cellular destruction as the primary event, which precedes and leads to the secondary energy failure.
