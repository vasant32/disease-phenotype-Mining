BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Production of nitric oxide is thought to play an important role in neuroinflammation. Previously, we have shown that combined inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) can reduce hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain injury in 12-day-old rats. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in expression of nNOS, iNOS and endothelial NOS (eNOS), and nitrotyrosine (NT) formation in proteins in neonatal rats up to 48 h after cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. METHODS: Twelve-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia, resulting in unilateral cerebral damage. NOS and nitrotyrosine expression were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis at 30 min-48 h after hypoxia-ischemia. RESULTS: nNOS was increased in both hemispheres from 30 min to 3 h after hypoxia-ischemia. In the contralateral hemisphere, eNOS was decreased 1-3 h after hypoxia-ischemia. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, eNOS was decreased at 0.5 h after hypoxia-ischemia, normalized at 1-3 h and was increased 6-12 h after hypoxia-ischemia. At 24 and 48 h after hypoxia-ischemia, eNOS levels normalized. Surprisingly, iNOS expression did not change from 30 min up to 48 h after hypoxia-ischemia in the ipsi- or contralateral hemisphere. In addition, the regional expression of iNOS in the brain as determined by immunohistochemistry did not change after hypoxia-ischemia. Expression of nitrotyrosine was slightly increased in both hemispheres only at 30 min after hypoxia-ischemia. CONCLUSION: In 12-day-old rat pups, cerebral hypoxia-ischemia induced a transient increase in nNOS, eNOS, and nitrotyrosine in proteins, but no change in iNOS expression up to 48 h after the insult.
