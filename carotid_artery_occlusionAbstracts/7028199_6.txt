1 The generation of prostanoids in the hearts of anaesthetized dogs was studied by irrigating in situ the epicardial surface with Krebs solution. Prostanoids were measured by direct bioassay on smooth muscles and by radioimmunoassay of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the epicardial irrigation fluid. 2 The epicardial irrigation fluid contained a prostacyclin-like substance, as indicated by the bioassay tissues, and immunoreactive 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha; PGE2-like materials were also detected. By both methods the output of the prostacyclin-like substance, which decreased with time of epicardial irrigation, was increased by manipulating the heart and by adding arachidonic acid (3 microgram/ml), and decreased by adding indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) to the irrigation fluid. 3 Bioassayed prostacyclin and immunoreactive 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha in the epicardial irrigation fluid increased by about 3-5 ng/ml during and after infusion of isoprenaline (0.1 microgram kg-1 min-1). The substance was not released by isoprenaline when indomethacin was added to the irrigation fluid, or when propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) was given intravenously. 4 Aortic constriction, bilateral carotid artery occlusion and intravenous angiotensin infusion all increased output of the prostacyclin-like substance into the epicardial irrigation fluid. The output was abolished by treating the heart with indomethacin (10 mg/kg intravenously or 1 microgram/ml epicardially). 5 The prostacyclin-like substance was also released by all of the above stimuli after the parietal pericardium had been removed and replaced by a plastic sheet. 6 It is concluded that prostacyclin is continually released from tissues close to the epicardial surface and from the pericardium, and that prostacyclin generation increases when cardiac workload increases. Prostacyclin of epicardial or pericardial origin might therefore contribute to metabolic regulation of coronary blood flow.
