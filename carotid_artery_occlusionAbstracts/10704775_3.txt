The effect of the respiratory stimulant, doxapram, on white matter damage was investigated in neonatal rats under cerebral ischemia. Five-day-old rats underwent bilateral carotid artery occlusion with or without 50 mg/kg i.p. of doxapram. Their brains were neuropathologically examined 48 h later. Doxapram induced about a 20% decrease of PCO(2) for 90 min, but did not cause any neuropathological abnormalities. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion resulted in mild cerebrocortical lesions in 67% of pups, and white matter lesions in the internal capsule in 44%. Doxapram, in addition to bilateral carotid artery occlusion, produced more severe white matter injury in the internal capsule (injury score; 0.67+/-0.87 vs. 1.70+/-0.48, P<0.05) and in the subcortical white matter (0.33+/-0. 67 vs. 1.10+/-0.54, P<0.05). These results demonstrated that the use of doxapram under an ischemic condition accentuates white matter damage in neonatal rats.
