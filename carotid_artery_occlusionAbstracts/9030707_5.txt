We have studied the beneficial effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) tosylate on blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and neuronal survival after transient cerebral ischemia in gerbils. BBB breakdown experiments were performed in pentobarbital anesthetized gerbils subjected to 10 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and 6 h of reperfusion. For BBB breakdown measurements, SAM (120 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to gerbils just after occlusion and thereafter every hour up to 5 h. Fluorometric measurements quantified the blood-brain permeability tracer, Evans blue (EB). SAM treatment significantly reduced the BBB breakdown as indicated by reduced levels of EB fluorescence. Neuronal count experiments were conducted in gerbils subjected to transient ischemia and 7 days of reperfusion. For neuronal count experiments SAM (15-120 mg/kg) was administered at 6 and 12 h after reperfusion, and twice each day thereafter for 7 days. SAM dose dependently protected the hippocampal CA1 neurons assessed by histopathological methods. SAM has a beneficial effect on the outcome of ischemic injury by reducing the BBB breakdown and neuronal death.
