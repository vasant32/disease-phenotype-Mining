BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and reliability of the mechanical detachment system of a new platinum coil, Detach-18, when used as a vascular occlusive device for neurovascular disease. METHODS: Forty-one patients (nine male and 32 female patients; age range, 26-75 years; mean age, 54.4 years) underwent treatment at seven centers. Twenty-two patients had dural arteriovenous fistulae of the transverse sinus treated by a transvenous route. Fourteen patients underwent internal carotid artery occlusion in the treatment of aneurysms, meningioma, facial tumor, or carotid injury. One patient underwent occlusion of the basilar artery and one patient underwent occlusion of the vertebral artery for treatment of aneurysms. In two patients, coils were used as part of the treatment of their arteriovenous malformations. In all cases, the Detach-18 coils were delivered through a microcatheter with two distal markers. Two types of coils, a 0.015-inch-diameter "regular" coil and a 0.014-inch-diameter "soft" coil, were used. RESULTS: A total of 569 coils were used, 541 of which were detached. The number of coils in ranged from four to 53 (average number of coils, 14). The coils passed easily through the microcatheter. The detachment maneuver occurred within 10 to 25 s with 20 turns of the introducing wire. No premature coil detachment occurred. Complete occlusion of the vessel lumen was achieved in 35 cases. In three cases, 80% to 90% occlusion was achieved. In two cases, 70% to 80% occlusion was achieved. There were no device-related complications. CONCLUSION: The detachment system was safe, reliable, consistent, and fast. This is a useful system for coil embolization in neurovascular applications.
