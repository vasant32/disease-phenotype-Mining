The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of unilateral carotid artery occlusion on the blood flow of submandibular gland in anesthetized rats and identify the role of nitric oxide (NO) in blood flow changes after the artery occlusion. L-NAME (N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester; 10 mg/kg/day, per os) dissolved in tap water was used to block nitric oxide synthase. Glandular blood flow was measured using Sapirstein's indicator (86Rb) distribution technique. In the control animals the blood flow of left (ligated side) submandibular gland was lower than in the right (unligated side) one (right: 76.4+/-15.4 ml/min/100 g, 64.1+/-13.4 ml/min/100 g, p<0.01). The blood flow of submandibular glands decreased in NOS blocked group versus control. The vascular resistance after L-NAME treatment was elevated (control: 11+/-2.3 R/kg, L-NAME: 17.5+/-4.1 R/kg, p<0.001). In L-NAME group the difference between blood flow value of the left and right submandibular gland was significantly lower than in the control group (control: -16%, NAME: -8%, p<0.01). Conclusion: The maintenance of the blood flow in the left submandibular gland during ligation of the left common carotid artery could be due to the good vascular anastomotic system at these regions and adaptation of the submandibular vessels to the decreased perfusion pressure. Nitric oxide may have a role in the regulation of blood flow tinder this condition.
