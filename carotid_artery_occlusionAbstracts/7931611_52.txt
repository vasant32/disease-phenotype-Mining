Hunterian proximal artery occlusion was used in the treatment of 160 of 335 patients harboring giant aneurysms of the anterior circulation. One hundred and thirty-three of these aneurysms arose from the internal carotid arteries, 20 from the middle cerebral arteries, and seven from the anterior cerebral arteries. Ninety percent of the patients had satisfactory outcomes. The safety of internal carotid artery occlusion has been greatly enhanced by preoperative flow studies and by test occlusion with an intracarotid balloon to identify those patients who require preliminary extracranial-to-intracranial bypass, which was used in all of the middle cerebral occlusions. The anterior cerebral artery had magnificent leptomeningeal collateral flow that prevented infarction even without cross flow. Obliteration of the aneurysm by thrombosis was complete, or nearly so, in all but four patients whose treatment was completed. Analysis of poor outcome in 16 patients revealed that hemodynamic ischemic infarction was known to occur after only two of the carotid occlusions.
