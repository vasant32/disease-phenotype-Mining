A 42-year-old patient with a bilateral extracranial internal carotid occlusion which was associated with a midline intracerebral tumour of the genu of the corpus callosum, is reported. This rare association is discussed in the light of the pathogenetic theories referred to in the literature in similar cases. It is felt that, such cases, although rarely encountered, should stimulate the adoption of more accurate neuroradiological investigations, in patients harbouring brain tumours, in order carefully to plan the anaesthetic and surgical procedures.
