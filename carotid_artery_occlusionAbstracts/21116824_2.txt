In internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO), a spontaneous increase of cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) may occur over time. Statins are known to increase CVR. We analyzed the influence of statin treatment and other cofactors on CVR improvement in patients with ICAO. Sixty-six patients with ICAO were reexamined after 15 Â± 6 months. CVR in both middle cerebral arteries was assessed by transcranial Doppler and inhalation of 7% CO(2). Pre-defined cut-off values were used to define exhausted CVR. Cofactors analyzed were: age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, statin treatment, degree of contralateral stenosis, quality of intracranial collateral flow, duration of ICAO. Mean CVR did not differ between the two studies. Twenty patients had exhausted CVR at baseline, 11 of them improved above the cut-off at follow-up (55%). Factors significantly associated with this improvement were good collateral pattern at baseline (p = 0.0065) and statin treatment (p = 0.0179). Odds ratios for improving CVR were 36.0 [95% CI 2.7-476.3] for good collateral flow and 20.0 [95% CI 1.7-238.6] for statin treatment. In conclusion, exhausted CVR frequently improves during the course of ICAO. Good collateral function and statin treatment are significantly associated with improving CVR.
