In patients with severe carotid stenosis or total occlusion, episodic contralateral motor dysfunction is more likely related to cerebral hypoperfusion than epileptogenic activity. A man with orthostatic-mediated right-sided limb shaking was found to have total left internal carotid artery occlusion. There was prominent reduction of cerebrovascular reserve seen on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed with and without acetazolomide. During assumption of an upright position transcranial Doppler (TCD) revealed a marked attenuation of the left middle cerebral artery flow pattern not associated with changes during electroencephalographic monitoring, even after administration of acetazolomide. In this man, limb shaking episodes were attributed to hypoperfusion of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, and not to epileptogenic activity.
