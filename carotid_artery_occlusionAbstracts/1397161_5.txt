The alterations of second-messenger ligand binding and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated in the gerbil brain after 2-h unilateral common carotid artery occlusion. [3H]Forskolin (FK) and [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) were used as specific ligands for adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity estimation, respectively. CBF was determined at the end of the experiment by the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. A quantitative autoradiographic method permitted simultaneous measurement of the three parameters in the same brain. The levels in the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, and hippocampus were analyzed. The animals were divided into three groups: Group 1 with severe ischemia (CBF in the lateral nuclei of the thalamus (CBFt) less than 50 ml/100 g/min), Group 2 with mild ischemia (CBFt greater than or equal to 50 ml/100 g/min), and the Sham Group. The PDBu binding revealed a statistically significant increase in the caudate-putamen, lateral nuclei of the thalamus and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus) on the ischemic side in Group 1 as compared to that in Group 2 and the Sham Group. In contrast, the FK binding did not show any significant changes in any of the regions. These data and our previous findings for 6-h ischemia suggest that (1) PKC translocation to the cell membrane may occur at the early ischemic phase in particular regions including the caudate-putamen, lateral nuclei of the thalamus and hippocampus, with the translocated PKC gradually diminishing during the subsequent ischemic period; and (2) the suppression of the AC system observed in 6-h ischemia may not appear in the early ischemic phase.
