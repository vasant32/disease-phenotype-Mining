Acetazolamide has been used for a long time for the evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics. Severe side effects as a result of acetazolamide infusion are uncommon. Two patients with unilatral internal carotid artery occlusion presented with enlargement of cerebral infarction after SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) with acetazolamide challenge. A 60-year-old man and a 72-year-old man suffered from stroke caused by unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Both patients underwent SPECT under acetazolamide challenge nine days later and nineteen days later respectively. Neurological symptoms did not change immediately after acetazolamide infusion in either case, but were impaired the next day and two days later respectively. CT and MRI revealed enlargement of the infarction. Both patients had lassitude and loss of appetite after acetazolamide administration, and it was possible that dehydration induced enlargement of the cerebral infarction.
