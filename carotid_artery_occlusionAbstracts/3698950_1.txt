One of the major obstacles to successful intranasal surgery in the horse is haemorrhage, even minor interferences causing profuse bleeding. Conventional techniques for haemostasis are ineffective or inhibit the progress of the surgery. Temporary bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery resulted in a substantial reduction in haemorrhage during intranasal surgery in five horses, with much improved visibility and facility of operation. The large contribution to the circle of Willis by the ventral spinal artery is believed to prevent cerebral ischaemia during this procedure. This paper describes the technique of temporary bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery and emphasises the importance of ancillary techniques such as packing of the nasal cavity and general postoperative management.
