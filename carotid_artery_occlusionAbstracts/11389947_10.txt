Although many kinds of rat and gerbil cerebral ischemic preconditioning models are available, only a focal ischemic preconditioning model in mice has been reported. As most genetic alterations have been performed in mice, it is urgent to develop mouse ischemic preconditioning models for investigating the molecular mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning in transgenic mice. In the present study, we developed a forebrain ischemic preconditioning model in C57Black/Crj6 (C57BL/6) mice. Forebrain ischemia was induced in C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 18 min. The conditioning ischemic insult lasting for 6 min was carried out 48 h before the 18-min BCCAO. On the seventh day after BCCAO, neuronal damage was visualized by microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry and quantified by cresyl violet staining. Terminal deoxytransferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed 72 h after reperfusion to detect DNA fragmentation. Ischemia for 18 min resulted in injury to the striatum, cortex and hippocampus. In comparison to the hippocampus, striatal neuronal injury was more severe and reproducible. Although the conditioning ischemia itself caused neither noticeable striatal neuronal damage nor DNA fragmentation, it significantly reduced striatal neuronal damage and DNA fragmentation caused by the subsequent 18-min ischemia. These results indicate that striatal neuronal injury after transient BCCAO can be strongly reduced by a sublethal ischemic episode in C57BL/6 mice. As many kinds of gene-altered C57BL/6 mice are available, this preconditioning model may be useful for investigating the molecular mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning in transgenic mice.
