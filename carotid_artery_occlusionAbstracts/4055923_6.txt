Levels of energy metabolites were measured in forebrain regions in fasted rats subjected to 4-h recirculation after 1 h of either incomplete or complete ischemia. Both models of ischemia were produced by a procedure combining bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, systemic hypotension, and CSF pressure elevation; the degree of intracranial hypertension was varied to produce incomplete and complete ischemia. Levels of brain lactate at the end of ischemia ranged from 16 to 19 mmol/kg in incomplete ischemia and from 11 to 13 mmol/kg in complete ischemia. Energy metabolism recovered evenly in the neocortical and subcortical regions with recirculation after incomplete ischemia. The metabolic recovery in the cerebral cortex after complete ischemia was similar to that observed after incomplete ischemia; however, recovery in the subcortical regions after complete ischemia was less extensive, NADH fluorescence remained high, and there was a fall in total creatine. Intracellular pH in the dorsal thalamus was more alkalotic after complete than incomplete ischemia. Thus, in the absence of profound tissue lactic acidosis, residual CBF during prolonged ischemia helps postischemic restitution of brain energy metabolism in subcortical regions. The pattern of poor recovery in these regions after complete ischemia suggests inadequate reperfusion. The decreased total creatine and the severe tissue alkalosis may be biochemical markers of advanced tissue injury during reflow.
