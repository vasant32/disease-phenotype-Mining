AIM: Previous studies demonstrated that mexiletine has some important features in the prevention of ischemic brain injury such as sodium and calcium canal blockage and free radical occurrence. Our aim was to investigate the effects of mexiletine on ischemic brain injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experiments were performed on 30 adult male Sprague- Dawley rats (285-425 g). Left middle cerebral artery occlusion following microcraniectomy and simultaneous bilateral carotid artery occlusion were performed. Three different treatments were included in this study: (a) "na√Øve" control group (no drug applied; n = 10); (b) "sham surgery" control group (only saline was applied; n = 10); and a (c) "treatment group (n = 10) where mexiletine was applied. After 24 h from ischemic insult, all rats were decapitated and prepared for immunocytochemical and histopathological analyses. Cerebral infarct volumes were calculated and compared using ANOVA and a Post- Hoc Bonferroni test in each group statistically. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences between the treatment (81.98 +/- 12.58 mm?), control (121.57 +/- 11.41 mm?) and sham (116.08 +/- 12.36 mm?) groups (p < 0,0001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Mexiletine should be considered as an alternative medication for prevention and treatment of ischemic brain injury due to its multipotent effects.
