Temporal arteritis is a rare systemic autoimmune disease and the arteritic process in this case of temporal arteritis involved large and medium-size arteries. Temporal arteritis with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is very rare. We report a case of temporal arteritis with ICA occlusion following superficial temporal artery (STA) -middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis, together with steroid therapy. A 73-year-old female presented with a headache, visual disturbance of left side, and suppression of activity. Left STA was inflammatory and overswelling. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and angiography revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) at the cervical portion and lowering of vascular reserve on PAO SPECT. Diagnosis as temporal arteritis was conclusive due to the clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and left temporal artery biopsy, so steroid pulse therapy was initiated. Inflammation of left STA disappeared after steroid therapy, but left ICA occlusion on angiography and lowering of vascular reserve on SPECT remained for 3 months afterwards. Because of this, STA-MCA anastomosis was performed. There were no complications after the operation and the donor artery has been patent for two years. Temporal arteritis with ICA occlusion that requires extracranial-intracranial bypass (EC-IC bypass) is very rare. STA-MCA anastomosis with steroid therapy is effective for the prevention of cerebral infarction.
