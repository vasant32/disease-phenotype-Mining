We investigated the effects of an L-type and N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, cilnidipine, on neurally mediated chronotropic responses to clarify the anti-autonomic profile of cilnidipine in anesthetized dogs. Pretreatment with cilnidipine (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 microg/kg, i.v.), which decreased mean blood pressure by 5 to 31 mm Hg, inhibited the changes in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine concentration induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion, whereas it had no effect on vagal nerve stimulation-induced bradycardia. These results suggest that antihypertensive and antisympathetic doses of cilnidipine fail to influence chronotropic responses mediated by parasympathetic nerve activation in the in vivo canine heart.
