The authors report a case of traumatic bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion following blunt neck trauma in order to point out the significance of repeated angiography at a time when CT scanning has become the primary method for cervico-cranial traumas. Here angiography yields 1. a precise diagnosis and 2. evidence of a possible spontaneous recanalisation.
