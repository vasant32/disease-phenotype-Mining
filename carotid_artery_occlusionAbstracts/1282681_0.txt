A 20-year-old male was admitted comatose immediately after a motorcycle accident. Initial computed tomography demonstrated traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the diagnosis of traumatic internal carotid artery occlusion was established by angiography. Conservative management improved his symptoms, but eventually he died from delayed traumatic apoplexy. Traumatic internal carotid artery occlusion is relatively rare, but is serious and requires early diagnosis and treatment. For patients with severe head trauma and vascular occlusion, anticoagulants are contraindicated, and frequent follow-up angiography is recommended.
