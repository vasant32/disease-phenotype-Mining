Mannitol has a beneficial effect on ischemic injury following a short-duration forebrain ischemic insult in rats. Using the same animal model, we attempted to show that this effect of mannitol could be traced (via an improvement in cerebral blood flow) to a tempering of the collapse in the high-energy phosphates that occurs during the insult. A 10 min ischemic insult was induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by a reduction of the blood pressure to 50 mmHg through removal of blood via a tail catheter. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor the energy state and the pH prior to, during, and after the insult. The studies show that mannitol administered in doses of 0.25 g kg-1 or 1.0 g kg-1 prior to the insult has no significant effect on the high-energy phosphate levels or on the cerebral pH during ischemia, or on their post-ischemia recovery.
