Little is known about the natural course of internal carotid artery occlusion and its possible recanalization. We present here a case of spontaneous recanalization of an acutely occluded internal carotid artery, angiographically reported, which later allowed the patient to benefit from surgical treatment. These and other similar cases raise the possibility of a more frequent recanalization of this artery than previously considered. We suggest routine follow-up of these patients to detect this eventuality, which could influence clinical outcome and secondary prophylaxis strategies.
