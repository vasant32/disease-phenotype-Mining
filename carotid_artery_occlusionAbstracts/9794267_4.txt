A 10-year prospective experience with routine non-shunting, even in the presence of a contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion, is reviewed. METHOD AND RESULTS: Carotid endarterectomy was performed without a shunt in 654 consecutive patients: group 1, 513 patients with contralateral stenosis of less than 79%: group 11, 74 patients with a greater than 80% contralateral stenosis; and group 111, 67 patients with a contralateral occlusion. Average cross-clamp time was 23 min. Neurological complications occurred within 30 days in 20 (3.0%) patients (10 strokes, seven transient ischemic attacks in group I, one transient ischemic attack in group II, and one stroke and one transient ischemic attack in group III). Immediate postoperative strokes, i.e. those five cases that could be implicated as caused by lack of a shunt, were rare (0.76%). There were five perioperative deaths (0.76%). CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy may be performed safely without a shunt even in the presence of a contralateral occlusion. Age, sex, preoperative indication, anesthetic agent and contralateral stenosis were not associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurological deficit.
