The aim of this study was to determine whether alaternin exhibits neuroprotective activity after transient cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Mice were subjected to BCCAO, and circulation was restored after 20 min. Alaternin (10 mg/kg, p.o) treatment significantly prevented nitrotyrosine and lipid peroxidation, as well as BCCAO induced-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Alaternin also significantly reduced microglial activation (a marker of inflammation). The number of viable neurons detected by Nissl staining increased with alaternin (10 mg/kg, p.o) treatment at 7 days post-BCCAO. In the passive avoidance task, alaternin significantly ameliorated BCCAO-induced cognitive impairments (P<0.05). These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of alaternin are mediated by its anti-inflammatory and radical scavenging activities.
