The present study has been designed to investigate the potential role of ubiquitin proteasome system and other proteases in acute as well as delayed aspects of ischemic preconditioning induced reversal of ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse brain. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion of 17 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h was employed in present study to produce ischemia and reperfusion induced cerebral injury in mice. Cerebral infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Memory was evaluated using elevated plus-maze test. Rota rod test was employed to assess motor incoordination. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion produced cerebral infarction and impaired memory and motor co-ordination. Three preceding episodes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 1 min and reperfusion of 1 min (ischemic preconditioning) both immediately before (for acute preconditioning) and 24 h before (for delayed preconditioning) global cerebral ischemia prevented markedly ischemia-reperfusion-induced cerebral injury as measured in terms of infarct size, loss of memory and motor coordination. Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), an inhibitor of ubiquitin proteasome system and other proteases attenuated the neuroprotective effect of both the acute as well as delayed ischemic preconditioning. It is concluded that the neuroprotective effect of both the acute as well as delayed phases of ischemic preconditioning may be due to the activation of ubiquitin proteasome system and other proteases.
