OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Treatment of symptomatic chronic totally occluded carotid artery has been limited to medical management. An ongoing clinical trial is examining the role of extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery in select patients with impaired cerebrovascular reserve based on PET imaging parameters. We describe a case utilizing stenting and angioplasty to treat a chronic total carotid occlusion as a potential alternative therapy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old woman presented with a right hemispheric ischemic stroke in the setting due to a right internal carotid artery total occlusion. INTERVENTION: She was treated medically with antiplatelet therapy and oral vasopressor agents. She returned with new symptoms 1 month later and was successfully treated with stenting and angioplasty. At the 9-month follow-up, she remains neurologically intact. CONCLUSION: Stenting and angioplasty may be a therapeutic option in select patients with chronic total carotid occlusion. Further study is required to determine the safety profile of this treatment modality.
