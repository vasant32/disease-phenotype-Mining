A surgical procedure has been developed to study the effects of cerebral ischemia in the unanesthetized Mongolian gerbil. The methodology is based upon the surgical isolation and instrumentation of both common carotid arteries. A loop of dental floss is placed around each carotid artery and passed through double lumen catheter material; this allows for later occlusion of the carotid arteries and their release in unanesthetized subjects. Functional changes following transient carotid artery occlusion are readily demonstrated by the occurrence of altered spontaneous locomotor activity at various times postischemia. This model should be useful in the evaluation of potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
