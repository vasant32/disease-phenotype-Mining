Two cases of dolichoectatic basilar artery with a mass effect to the brainstem structure were treated by reducing hemodynamic stress. In one case, angiograms showed the dolichoectatic basilar artery creating a turbulent flow in the vertebrobasilar junction, and unilateral vertebral artery clipping in addition to posterior fossa decompression was performed. The other case, a combination with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion, underwent bilateral superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomoses. The possible surgical treatments of dolichoectasia are discussed.
