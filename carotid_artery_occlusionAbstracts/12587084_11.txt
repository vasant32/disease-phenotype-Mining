BACKGROUND: The occurrence of severe carotid artery disease in more than 12 % of patients requiring CABG results in a discrepancy concerning the best treatment for both diseases. We reviewed the early outcome of patients with CABG and/or valve replacement and simultaneous carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: We evaluated retrospectively 244 patients operated simultaneously between 7/94 and 10/2001. 209 patients received CABG; 35 patients CABG and/or valve replacement. Mean age was 68 years. 188 patients were male. We analyzed risk factors, morbidity, incidence of neurological complications and 30 day mortality. RESULTS: Perioperative stroke with hemiplegia occurred in 3.3 % (8 patients). 4 of these patients showed contralateral carotid artery occlusion, 2 contralateral severe stenosis. 2 patients (0.8 %) experienced prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit (PRIND), 4 patients (1.6 %) transient ischemic attack (TIA). 30-day lethality was 4.5 %. 3 patients died due to low cardiac output, 6 patients due to extracardial reasons, 2 patients (0.8 %) developed a cerebral death. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous CEA and cardiac surgery can be performed with an acceptable risk for neurological complications and mortality. Occlusion of contralateral carotid artery could be identified as an evident predictor for increased neurological complications. Compared to two-stage procedures, combined operations yield a reduction of hospital costs.
