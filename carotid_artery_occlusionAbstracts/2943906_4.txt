The treatment of choice for various aneurysms of the common and internal carotid arteries may involve carotid artery occlusion rather than a reconstructive approach. Carotid occlusion may be accomplished either surgically or via an endovascular method. We present two cases of patients with cervical carotid artery aneurysms in which the endovascular method was used for carotid occlusion, describe our rationale for using this approach rather than surgical intervention, and discuss the role of this method of treatment for this condition.
