 OBJECTIVE: To discuss the efficiency and safety of carotid angioplasty stenting (CAS) in patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion. METHODS: From January 2001 to January 2010, 56 carotid artery stenosis patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion were performed CAS and the feature and results of these cases were analyzed retrospectively. All the cases were confirmed to be carotid artery stenosis with contralateral carotid artery occlusion by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The diameter stenosis rate was 72% ± 15%. CAS were performed with distal protection device in 56 cases. RESULTS: The technique success rate of CAS were 100% in all the 56 patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion and post-procedure stenosis rate descended to 13% ± 8%, and the symptoms of cerebral ischemia were all improved. Only 1 case occurred remote hemorrhage in the position of previous cerebral infarction in the side of CAS after the procedure, and recovered with light neurological deficit after the craniotomy to remove the hematoma. No ischemic complications or death occurred. During the following up of 6 months to 3 years, no cerebral ischemic symptoms reoccurred. The rechecking results of color Doppler of 47 cases and DSA of 2 cases showed no restenosis in-stent. CONCLUSIONS: CAS is safe and effective for the patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion. Critical election of the case, operation of skilled doctors and scrupulous postprocedure general management can decrease the rate of complication.
