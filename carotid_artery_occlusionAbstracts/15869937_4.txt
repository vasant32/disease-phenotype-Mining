Cyclin G1 (CG1) was identified as a p53-transactivated target gene, and yet its physiological and pathological roles have been unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CG1 is translocated from cytoplasm to the nuclei of neurons in response to variety of injuries. In the normal matured rodent brain, CG1 immunoreactivity was hardly observed; however, some brain injuries exhibited intense CG1 immunoreactivity in the nuclei of the damaged neurons. Transient common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) in the gerbil showed strong CG1-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 neurons, and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the mouse showed strong CG1-like immunoreactivity in the nuclei of neurons located in the ischemic brain regions. TUNEL staining did not exactly overlap with the CG1-positive cells, but overlapped highly with Fluoro-Jade B staining, a degeneration marker. Brain trauma caused by knife cut, cold injury, and kinate injection also showed CG1 accumulation in the neuronal nuclei located near the injury site. These observations were obtained in p53-deficient mice as well, suggesting that the accumulation of CG1 in the injured neurons is p53-independent. A similar nuclear translocation of endogenous CG1 was confirmed in a primary culture of cortical neurons when a toxic level of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was applied. These results demonstrate that nuclear translocation of CG1 from cytoplasmic region occurs in damaged and degenerating neurons in a p53-independent manner, and the CG1 nuclear staining could be a good marker for the neurons received fatal damages.
