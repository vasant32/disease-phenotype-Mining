Two patients with left painful ophthalmoplegia, caused by infiltrating lesion in left superior orbital fissure and/or cavernous sinus, subsequently developed left cerebral infarction associated with occlusion of the proximal portion of left internal carotid artery demonstrated by CT and angiogram. It thus is worthy to remind that painful ophthalmoplegia may have the possibility of resulting in cerebral infarction associated with carotid occlusion.
