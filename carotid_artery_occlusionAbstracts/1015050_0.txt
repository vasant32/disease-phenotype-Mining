An attempt has been made by the authors to find correlations between the collateral circulation and clinical condition in thirty-three patients suffering from occlusions of the internal and common carotid arteries. It has been found that the course of disease will be less severe when a collateral circulation is developed; also, this results in late consequences being much less severe in character. The age and general condition of the patient were found to be of major importance to the course of disease. Patients of advanced age usually do not show any appreciable improvement even in those cases where a collateral circulation has developed. Anatomical examinations showed that there existed a large number of collateral circulations between the external carotid artery and the branches of the ophthalmic artery. Playing the most important role among these branches of the external carotid artery are the maxillary and facial arteries. This has also been confirmed by the results of angiographic examinations made in vivo. Also described in this paper are rare cases of development of collateral circulations which were reported in the literature and which may be considered as contributing to the compensation of conditions characterized by the occlusion of the internal carotid artery.
