Sixty-three patients with internal carotid artery occlusion manifesting as transient ischemic attack or minor stroke received superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery and medical treatment (n = 27) or medical treatment only (n = 36). Long-term follow-up showed that there was no significant difference in the outcomes. However, positron emission tomography studies suggested that patients with misery perfusion in the chronic stage benefited from extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery.
