Pressure transients resulting from square-wave changes in abdominal aortic blood flow rate were used to derive effective arterial compliance and peripheral resistance of the hind-limb circulation of anaesthetized rabbits. The model for deriving these parameters proved applicable if step changes in flow were kept less than 35% of mean flow. Under resting conditions, the effective hind-limb arterial compliance of normal rabbits averaged 3.46 X 10(-3) mL/mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa). Hind-limb arterial compliance decreased with increasing pressure at low arterial pressures, but unlike compliance of isolated arterial segments, compliance did not vary at and above normal resting pressures. Baroreflex destimulation (bilateral carotid artery occlusion) caused an increase in effective hind-limb vascular resistance at 48.4% and a decrease of arterial compliance of 50.7%, so that the constant for flow-induced arterial pressure changes (resistance times compliance) was largely unchanged. Similarly, the arterial time constant for rabbits with chronic hypertension was similar to that for controls because threefold increases in hind-limb vascular resistance were offset by decreases in compliance. Reflex-induced decreases in arterial compliance are probably mediated by sympathetic nerves, whereas decreases associated with hypertension are related to wall hypertrophy in conjunction with increased vasomotor tone. Arterial compliance decreased with increasing pressure in hypertensive animals, but this effect was less pronounced than in normotensive rabbits.
