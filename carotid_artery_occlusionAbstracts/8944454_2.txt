A total of 700 patients who had carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the UK and Ireland during a 6-month interval between March and August 1994 were studied prospectively. Some 108 patients (15.4 per cent) had a contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Previous reports have shown an associated stroke rate of about 10 per cent in these patients. This study assessed complications and outcome for patients undergoing CEA with contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion compared with those without. The indications for surgery were comparable between the two groups although the patients with occlusion had a slightly higher incidence of arrhythmia and stroke. Intraoperative shunts were used in a significantly higher proportion of those with occlusion (83.3 versus 64.7 per cent, P = 0.0001). The combined death and stroke rate for patients with occlusion was 5.6 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent for the remainder (P not significant). On the basis of the present data, CEA with a contralateral carotid artery occlusion carries only a slight increase in the rate of postoperative stroke and death. This increase was not statistically significant and is lower than that reported previously.
