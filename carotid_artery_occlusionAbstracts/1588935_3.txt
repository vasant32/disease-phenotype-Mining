Rats were subjected to bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for varying time periods. The concentration of reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were determined in whole brain after varying periods of reperfusion. Lipid peroxidation was also assessed by determining the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain. Reperfusion for 1 hr following bilateral carotid artery occlusion resulted in significant decrease in total glutathione (GSH) concentration along with small but significant increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels. After 4 hr of reperfusion, GSH levels recovered, although GSSG levels remained elevated up to 12 hr of reperfusion. Increase in malondialdehyde levels was also detected in the brain up to 12 hr of reperfusion. Glutathione reductase activity remained significantly low up to 144 hr of reperfusion, while glutathione peroxidase activity remained unaffected. These results demonstrate that oxidative stress is generated in the brain during reperfusion following partial ischemia due to bilateral carotid artery occlusion.
