We investigated the distribution of neuronal damage following brief cerebral transient ischemia and repeated ischemia at 1-h intervals in the gerbil, using light microscopy and 45Ca autoradiography as a marker for detection of ischemic damage. The animals were allowed to survive for 7 days after ischemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Following 2-min ischemia, neuronal damage determined by abnormal calcium accumulation was not observed in the forebrain regions. Following 3-min ischemia, however, abnormal calcium accumulation was recognized only in the hippocampal CA1 sector and part of the striatum. Two 2-min ischemic insults caused extensive abnormal calcium accumulation in the dorsolateral part of striatum, the hippocampal CA1 sector, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the inferior colliculus. The ischemic insults were more severe than that of a single 3-min ischemia. However, three 1-min ischemic insults caused abnormal calcium accumulation only in the striatum. On the other hand, three 2-min ischemic insults caused severe abnormal calcium accumulation in the brain. The abnormal calcium accumulation was found in the dorsolateral part of striatum, the hippocampal CA1 sector, the thalamus, the medial geniculate body, the substantia nigra and the inferior colliculus. Gerbils subjected to three 3-min ischemic insults revealed most severe abnormal calcium accumulation. Marked calcium accumulation was seen not only in the above sites, but also spread in the neocortex, the septum and the hippocampal CA3 sector. Morphological study after transient or repeated ischemia indicated that the distribution and frequency of the neuronal damage was found in the sites corresponding to most of the regions of abnormal calcium accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
