The neuroprotective action by water-soluble form of quercetin was examined in gerbils after transient forebrain ischemia. The animals were exposed to 7 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Hippocampal CA 1 area was examined 7 days after ischemia-reperfusion. The average density of CA1 pyramidal neurons and GFAP-positive glial cells were counted in sham operated group, in ischemic group and in the groups treated with water-soluble form of quercetin. It was shown that quercetin revealed protective effect by decreasing of delayed neuronal death and reducing reactive astrogliosis after ischemia-reperfusion.
