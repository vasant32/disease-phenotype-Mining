A quantitative technique utilising [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid as a tracer was used to study cerebrovascular permeability in 22 Mongolian gerbils. Seven other animals were used to measure cerebral blood volumes. Global cerebral ischaemia was produced by temporary bilateral carotid artery occlusion (60 min) in 16 gerbils that were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 h following reperfusion. The blood-to-brain transfer constant was significantly increased after 2 h of reperfusion in the ischaemic zones and also in structures, like the cerebellum, not supplied by the carotid artery and not ischaemic during the vessel occlusion. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations were coincident with the onset of ischaemia--induced seizures that were accompanied by sudden "spikes" of systemic blood pressure. Epilepsy may play an important role in the development of BBB damage in this ischaemic model, and this factor must be considered in the interpretation of BBB damage data in gerbils.
