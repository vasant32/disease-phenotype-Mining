 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), a thrombin receptor, mediates neuronal injury in experimental cerebral ischemia. The present study investigated whether PAR-1 plays a role in brain injury after global cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Adult male wild-type or PAR-1 knockout mice underwent a 20-minute bilateral common carotid artery occlusion or a sham operation. Behavior tests were performed before ischemia and 1, 2, and 3 days after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Mice were euthanized at different time points for thrombin activity, brain edema, Western blot analysis, and brain histology. RESULTS: Thrombin activity and PAR-1 expression were increased in the brain after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Compared with wild-type mice, PAR-1 knockout mice had less brain edema formation, neuronal death, and behavior impairment after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. In addition, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases was absent in PAR-1 knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: PAR-1 contributes to the brain injury induced by global cerebral ischemia, which may be related to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
