Two cases of overlooked, traumatic unilateral occlusion of the carotid artery are reported. Postmortem revealed occlusion of the internal carotid artery in one case and that of the common carotid artery in another. The progression of the morbid state, along with the management with emphasis on the significance of the carotid angiogram and follow-up repeated computed tomography are mentioned. Although traumatic occlusion of the common carotid artery is not as common as that of the internal carotid artery, both entities are well known to produce morbidity and mortality.
