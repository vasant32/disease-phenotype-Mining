Numerous reports describe the relative effectiveness of external carotid artery (ECA) revascularization in patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Most, however, suffer from small numbers of patients or lack of detailed follow-up data. In addition, controversy persists regarding the safety with which this procedure can be performed. Twenty-two patients underwent a total of 27 ECA revascularizations. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. During a mean follow-up period of 46 months, no strokes occurred and only two patients suffered transient ischemic attacks. Revascularization of the ECA is an effective means of treating the patient with ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and may be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality.
