On admission to hospital during the acute phase of a stroke presumed due to ischaemic infarction in one cerebral hemisphere 93 patients were examined to determine the factors associated with a poor prognosis for immediate survival. The patients particularly at risk were those who were overtly unconscious and those with any combination of impaired consciousness, dense hemiplegia, and failure of conjugate ocular gaze towards the side of the limb weakness. Necropsy evidence suggested that these signs usually indicate infarction of the whole of one middle cerebral artery territory which is often secondary to internal carotid artery occlusion and commonly produces fatal cerebral oedema.
