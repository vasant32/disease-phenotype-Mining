Cerebrovascular deseases , cerebral vessels deseases, represents one of the greatest problems of humankind. The reasons are not just the high incidence and relatively high prevalence of letal outcomes in the acute faze of the desease, but also high level of disfunctionality caused by this disease in numerous patients who survived cerebrovascular insult and haemorraghe The onset, course and outcome of cerebrovascular diseases depends among other things on the possibility o f colateral brain circulation establishment. Willis ring onthe base of the brain is the most important anastomosis between circulation in both carotid arteries and basilar artery. First precondition for Willis ring t o function as valvular mechanisam is its intact configuration. But, it is found in almost half of th e subjectsincluded in the study that certain anatomical abnormalities in the Willis ring structure exist. Presence of these abnormalities favors onset of vascular diseases since they unables colateral circulation establishment. Studies till now have shown that all components of Willis ring do not contribute equally in colateral function among obstructive diseases.
