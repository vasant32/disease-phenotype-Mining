The behavioral and biochemical effects of a new dipeptide mimetic of the GK-2 nerve growth factor (NGF) have been studied on a model of chronic cerebral ischemia induced by permanent common carotid artery occlusion in rats. It is established that subchronic intraperitoneal injections of GK-2 (0.5 mg/kg) 4 h after surgery, followed by seven more injections made every 24 h, fully prevent the death of operated animals and reduces the development of habitation deficit (open-field test) and decrease in exploratory activity (novel object examination) two weeks after surgery, as well as fully restores the viability of cerebral cortex cells and decreases the hyperexpression of HSP70 in cerebral cortex.
