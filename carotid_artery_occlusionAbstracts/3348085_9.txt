Three transient episodes of 5 min ischemia spaced at 1-h intervals were produced in Mongolian gerbils by bilateral carotid artery occlusion with an implanted vascular occlusion device. The interval of 1 h was chosen to allow for the development of post-ischemic hypoperfusion between the ischemic episodes. Three minutes and 1 h after each ischemic episode, and 6 and 24 h after the third occlusion, Evan's blue (EB) was injected intravenously to trace circulating blood, and the number of perfused capillaries was determined in various brain regions by fluorescence microscopy. Brain edema was evaluated by measuring specific gravity in tissue samples taken from adjacent areas. Repetitive ischemia caused progressively increasing brain edema and a progressive reduction of the number of perfused capillaries. Immediately after each ischemic episode, transient recruitment of capillaries occurred, thus excluding no-reflow as a main pathogenetic factor of microcirculatory disturbances. The pattern of microcirculation 6 and 24 h after the last occlusion revealed a redistribution of circulating blood, characterized by a reduction in the number of EB-filled capillaries associated with a noticeable dilatation of the larger vascular channels. Our studies suggest a close interrelationship between post-ischemic microcirculatory hypoperfusion and the development of brain edema, the degree and extent of which progresses with the repetition of ischemic episodes when they are carried out during the periods of hypoperfusion.
