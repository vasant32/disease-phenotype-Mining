Possible effect of an ethanolic root extract of Pongamia pinnata (L) Pierre (P. pinnata) on oxidant-antioxidant status and histopathological changes in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat forebrain have been investigated. Further, its effect was also assessed on long-term cerebral hypoperfusion-induced changes in anxiety, cognitive and histopathological parameters. Cerebral post-ischemic reperfusion is known to be associated with generation of free radicals. In the present study, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 30 min followed by 45 min reperfusion produced increases in lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a fall in the total tissue sulfhydryl (T-SH) levels. The ethanolic extract of roots of P. pinnata (50 mg kg(-1), po for 5 days) attenuated the ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in lipid peroxidation, SOD activity and a fall in T-SH levels. The extract also ameliorated histopathological changes and inflammatory cell infiltration in the frontoparietal region of the rat brain. The extract (50 mg kg(-1), po for 15 days) was also found to alleviate the long-term hypoperfusion-induced anxiety and listlessness (open field paradigm). There was an improvement of learning and memory deficits (Morris' water maze testing). It also attenuated reactive changes in forebrain histology like gliosis, lymphocytic infiltration, astrocytosis and cellular edema. Results suggest protective role of P. pinnata in ischemia-reperfusion injury and cerebrovascular insufficiency states.
