Transient brain ischemia results in a selective destruction of cell bodies within the hippocampus and cortex. This cellular destruction appears to be mediated through a release of endogenous exictatory amino acids following the ischemic episode, since the neurotoxic effects of ischemia can be attenuated by compounds that have antagonist activity at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In the present study, the protective effects of a novel NMDA receptor antagonist, CGS 19755, were further evaluated by using quantitative autoradiography to characterize adenosine A1, NMDA, PCP, and benzodiazepine receptors in ischemic gerbil brain. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (20 minutes) resulted in marked decreases (30-60%) in adenosine A1, NMDA, and PCP, but not benzodiazepine, receptors in gerbil forebrain. Postischemic treatment with CGS 19755 was found to completely block the ischemia-induced decreases in brain adenosine and NMDA receptors. [3H]TCP binding in ischemic gerbil brain was also elevated by CGS 19755 treatment; significant differences remained, however, between the CGS 19755-treated and control gerbils. These results indicate that transient brain ischemia produces significant and selective alterations in gerbil forebrain receptor systems. The observed decreases in radioligand binding are probably reflective of an ischemia-induced destruction of forebrain structures. However, there is some evidence that transient ischemia can also cause long-term changes in the affinity of some receptor systems. The postischemic efficacy of CGS 19755 appears to be due to its ability to block the neurotoxic effects of transient ischemia.
