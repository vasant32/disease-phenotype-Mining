Thirty-one patients with cerebral transient ischemic, attacks and ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion without contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion or stenosis were treated with a surgical anastomosis between a superficial temporal artery and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery of the symptomatic hemisphere. The anastomosis was successful in 28 patients. Recurrent transient ischemic attacks were abolished in 23 patients and reduced in three. Two patients, one with a patent anastomosis, had strokes during the follow-up period. Of seven patients who refused the operation, two had strokes, two noted a reduction of transient ischemic attacks, two noted no change, and one became asymptomatic.
