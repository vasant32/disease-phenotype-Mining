The purpose of these experiments were to study the interactions of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) with baroreceptor reflexes induced by transient carotid clamping. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion resulted in a reversible and reproducible hypertension in the vagotomized animals. This hypertensive reaction was blocked by intraventricular injection of NMDA antagonists, such as 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptaneoate (AP-7) and phencyclidine (PCP). We also found that blood pressure-sensitive neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) could be classified into two groups, on the basis of their responses to norepinephrine given intravenously. Using pressure microejection and single unit recording, we observed that clamping of the common carotids resulted in excitation of type I neurons. This evoked excitation, similar to that induced by NMDA, was blocked by locally applied AP-7. However, the carotid occlusion-induced responses of type II neurons were not blocked by AP-7. In conclusion, the present data suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in hypertensive responses during carotid occlusion, perhaps involving a site in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.
