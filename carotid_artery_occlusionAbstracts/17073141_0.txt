Deltaran decreased the amplitude of EEG slow waves and restored neuronal reactivity after carotid artery occlusion in Wistar rats sensitive to cerebral ischemia. Deltaran had no effect on local cerebral blood flow. This drug increased blood supply to a unit of neuronal activity in the brain of intact animals during the acute stage of cerebral ischemia, provided 100% survival rate of rats with cerebral ischemia, and prevented the development of neurological symptoms in survivors. Animal experiments proved the possibility of correcting cerebral ischemia with antistress drug Deltaran.
