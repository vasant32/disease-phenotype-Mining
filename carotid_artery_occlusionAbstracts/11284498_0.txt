PURPOSE: The ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) is sometimes a complication of common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion causing complete interruption of blood flow through both the internal and external carotid arteries we investigated a single case of an isolated OIS that remained undiagnosed for two years, because the underlying CCA pathology caused no cerebral involvement. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man presented with subacute painful visual loss in the right eye in a setting of hypertension, smoking and coronary artery disease. RESULTS. Neurological examination, a brain CT and MRI scan were all normal. Extensive laboratory work-up excluded small artery disease, inflammatory arteritis or cardiac causes of retinal embolism. Ophthalmologic evaluation and fluorescein angiography gave findings consistent with OIS, while vascular ultrasound evaluation and aortic arch angiography verified right CCA occlusion accompanied by an extensive collateral network. CONCLUSIONS: Had this patient been referred sooner for a simple carotid artery work-up, both the CCA occlusion and the OIS could probably had been prevented.
