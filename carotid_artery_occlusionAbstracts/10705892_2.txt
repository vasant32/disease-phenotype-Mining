OBJECTIVE: To describe neurological complications occurring after roller-coaster rides. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 6 cases of complications occurring after roller-coaster rides and analyze published data. RESULTS: Complications seen our patients included 5 cervicoencephalic arterial dissections, one with brainstem dysfunction due to extending syringobulbia. Reported data include one cervicoencephalic arterial dissection, one case of carotid artery occlusion, 3 cases of subdural hematoma, one with subarachnoid hemorrhage, one with cerebrospinal fluid leak, and one with Brown-Séquard syndrome secondary to an enterogenous cyst of the spinal cord. In all patients, pain was the first symptom experienced. In 71.4% of cases, it occurred immediately after the trauma. Marfanís syndrome may be the only risk factor identifiable prior to exposure. The mechanisms of most complications are poorly understood but are likely to involve sudden head and neck flexion-extension movements. CONCLUSION: Neurological complications occurring after roller-coaster rides are highly uncommon, but may leave invalidating sequelae or be fatal. Clinicians should be aware of these complications so these patients can be given proper care early, particularly at the stage when pain is the only sign. Early management could help limit the consequences of these complications.
