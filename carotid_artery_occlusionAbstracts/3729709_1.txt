Conjunctival oxygen tension (PcjO2) was measured continuously during carotid endarterectomy in 15 patients to evaluate its sensitivity in patients receiving shunts. These studies suggest that PcjO2 tracks brain perfusion during periods of carotid artery occlusion. Reduced PcjO2 was clearly demonstrated with systemic hypotension, carotid artery clamping, and carotid shunt obstruction and clamping. Monitoring of PcjO2 is noninvasive, easy to perform, offers no danger to the patient, and allows real-time assessment of the local tissue perfusion. It provides valuable information on the effectiveness of carotid oxygen transport and, in conjunction with arterial blood gas values, expresses carotid artery perfusion relative to systemic oxygen transport. Further investigations using the PcjO2 sensor may define criteria for intraoperative carotid arterial shunting in patients with tenuous cerebral perfusion, and for prompt intervention in patients with deteriorating perfusion prior to the onset of life-threatening cerebral ischemia.
