N omega-nitro-L-arginine (0.3-10 mg/kg), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, was administered i.p. to gerbils subjected to 10 min of carotid artery occlusion seven times at 5 min, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after recirculation. Histopathological examination of the brains obtained 6 days after reflow disclosed that N omega-nitro-L-arginine possesses an ability to mitigate neuronal necrosis in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus with an optimal dosage of 3 mg/kg. These results strongly suggest that NO synthase activation is at least partly involved in the pathogenetic cellular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal necrosis following cerebral ischemia.
