A case with spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula treated by balloon catheter technique combined with a extra-intracranial by-pass using a saphenous vein graft between the common carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery is reported. A 72-year-old female was admitted with complaints of recurrent symptoms of carotid-cavernous fistula 4 months after spontaneous remission. Angiograms showed the presence left internal carotid-cavernous sinus fistula. Poor cross-filling from the right internal carotid artery to the territory of the left internal carotid artery via the hypoplastic right A1 and left posterior communicating artery was also observed. Symptoms such as chemosis, exophthalmos and visual disturbance gradually progressed during the hospitalization. A common carotid-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed with a saphenous vein graft and the carotid cavernous fistula was occluded directly with a balloon catheter. The blood flow via the graft, cortical blood flow, cortical tissue O2 and CO2 were continuously measured during the operation. After the internal carotid artery occlusion, sufficient blood flow via the graft and no significant changes of the cortical blood flow, cortical tissue O2 and CO2 were observed. The postoperative angiogram showed that the by-pass was patent and all branches of the left internal carotid artery were filled via the by-pass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the progressive symptoms improved except for visual disturbance on the left. She is in good condition one year after the operation. The usefulness of this surgical procedure with monitoring of cerebral blood flow and metabolism during operation is also discussed.
