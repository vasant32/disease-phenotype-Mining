There is evidence that systemic hyperglycaemia influences the evolution of cerebral ischaemia adversely, through enhancement of brain lactic acidosis. A potential protective regimen based on induction of mild hypoglycaemia with insulin was therefore studied. Respiratory control in brain mitochondria prepared from the ischaemic hemisphere of rats subjected to unilateral common carotid artery occlusion for one hour was abolished, but was partially preserved in insulin-treated rats (p = 0.01).
