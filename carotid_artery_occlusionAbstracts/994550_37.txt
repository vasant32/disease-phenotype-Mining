A series of 58 operations on 56 patients, in whom a branch of the superficial temporal artery was anastomosed to a branch of the middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA bypass or Yasargil procedure), is reviewed. These operations were performed chiefly for occlussions or for inaccessible stenotic lesions of the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries. Patency in eight patients operated on from April 1971 through November 1973 was low (25%). Patency in patients operated on since July 1974 has been high (95%). There have been no deaths and no major ischemic strokes attributable to the surgery. The rationale for this procedure is considered in relationship to the anatomy and physiology of the cerebral circulation and the pathogenesis of syndromes of cerebral ischemia. The operation appears to have a low morbidity in good-risk patients. The role of this operation in managing common manifestations of cerebral vascular disease such as focal transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIAs) and amaurosis fugax, although not fully established, appears encouraging. The procedure seems useful for orthostatic cerebral ischemia caused by multiple occlusions of major extracranial (and intracranial) vessels and, occasionally, for progressing strokes related to internal carotid artery occlusion, both of which are relatively uncommon manifestations of cerebral vascular occlusive disease. It may have application in the rare "slow stroke." The procedure is probably of limited value, if any, in the management of large completed infarcts but may be indicated in selected patients with small infarctions who have preserved most of their cerebral function and who have had evidence of subsequent focal ischemic events. The procedure is useful for bypassing giant aneurysms or basofrontal tumors invading major vessels. It may have a role in the management of fibromuscular disease of the internal carotid artery.
