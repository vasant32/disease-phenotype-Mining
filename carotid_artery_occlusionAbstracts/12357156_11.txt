BACKGROUND: Preconditioning to ischemia is a phenomenon whereby a brief episode of sublethal ischemia and other nonlethal stressors produce protection against a subsequent detrimental ischemic insult. As mitochondrial dysfunction is related to necrotic and apoptotic neuronal death after cerebral ischemia, the authors examined if ischemic preconditioning is capable of inducing mitochondrial tolerance. METHODS: Forebrain ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with simultaneous hypotension for 8 min in Wistar rats (275-300 g). A 3-min ischemic episode performed 48 h before the 8-min ischemia was used for preconditioning. The extents of hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage were evaluated 7 days after reperfusion by neuro-specific nuclear protein immunostaining. Brain mitochondria were isolated 48 h after animals were subjected to the sham operation or the 3-min conditioning ischemia. Loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria after cerebral ischemia in vivo and after exposure of brain mitochondria to calcium in vitro was used as an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction. RESULTS: Results showed that ischemic preconditioning induced by a 3-min ischemic episode dramatically reduced the loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons resulting from a subsequent 8-min ischemia 7 days after reperfusion, and this protection was associated with a preservation of mitochondrial cytochrome c as examined after early reperfusion. Exposure of isolated brain mitochondria to calcium produced a dose-dependent increase in cytochrome c release either at 30 degrees C or at 37 degrees C. Compared with those animals receiving only sham operation, cytochrome c release caused by 100 microm calcium was significantly reduced in conditioned animals. CONCLUSION: Regarding the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in mediating ischemic neuronal death, the above results indicate that mitochondria may serve as end-effecting organelles to ischemic preconditioning.
