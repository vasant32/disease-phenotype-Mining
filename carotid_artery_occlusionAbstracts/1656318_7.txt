Recent studies in the rat have suggested that hippocampal norepinephrine can regulate the amount of damage seen after transient forebrain ischemia. We used the gerbil to study the role of norepinephrine in ischemic damage. Using tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry and chemical measurements of norepinephrine, we determined that the gerbil hippocampus has a similar but topographically different norepinephrine innervation than the rat. Brains from gerbils treated with 100 mg/kg of N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-methyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) had 60% less norepinephrine than saline-treated controls, similar to the effect of the drug in rats. We administered DSP4 to gerbils two weeks before exposing them to 5 min of bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Animals treated with DSP4 and subjected to ischemia had worse pyramidal cell loss in the CA3 and CA4 regions than saline-treated ischemic controls. CA1 pyramidal cell loss (about 90%) was severe in both the saline- and DSP4-treated animals. These data provide further evidence that norepinephrine can regulate the neuronal death in the hippocampal formation after transient forebrain ischemia. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration of that regulation in the gerbil and suggests that noradrenergic input to the hippocampus may be important in ischemia in other species besides the rat.
