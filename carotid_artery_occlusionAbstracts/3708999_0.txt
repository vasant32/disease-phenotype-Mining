The difference in mean hemispheric CBF was compared in two groups of patients suffering from one-sided cerebral ischemia. One group without significant arteriographic abnormalities and a group with a one-sided internal carotid artery occlusion. The Xenon inhalation method (ISI) was used. It seems to be difficult to draw any conclusions from the differences between mean hemispheric ISI values, especially for patients with fairly severe clinical symptoms. In far the most patients without significant arteriographic abnormalities, no significant difference was found. A great difference (high ISI ratio) for patients with no or only slight symptoms may indicate a disturbed blood flow to the hemisphere with the lower ISI. Such high ratios were only found in patients suffering from a one-sided occlusion of the internal carotid artery. This rather simple and harmless method of blood flow measurement may prove to be a valuable contribution toward insight into the pathophysiology of blood flow in patients, especially those suffering from one-sided internal carotid artery occlusion.
