Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an acute fulminant opportunistic fungal infection usually seen in diabetic or immunocompromised patients. The fungi that cause mucormycosis inoculate the nasal mucosa and may spread to the paranasal sinuses, orbit, and brain. Our patient initially presented with mild ethmoid sinusitis. At that time, brain MRI and contrast-enhanced MR angiography were grossly normal. However, aggravation of sinusitis with extension to the right orbit and anterior cranial fossa rapidly developed within two months. Moreover, an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery was combined. We report a case of a pathologically-proven rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis with serial follow-up imaging for over one year.
