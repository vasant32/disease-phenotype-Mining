A 12-year-old girl with serologically-proved Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection developed right-sided hemiparalysis 10 days after the onset of the disease. Cerebral infarction was documented by cranial computed tomography; cerebral angiography revealed left carotid artery occlusion. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal. Cerebral infarction is a rare central nervous system complication of M. pneumoniae infection; however, occlusion of the internal carotid artery near the bifurcation has never been demonstrated; therefore, this patient with central nervous system complication of M. pneumoniae infection is unique.
