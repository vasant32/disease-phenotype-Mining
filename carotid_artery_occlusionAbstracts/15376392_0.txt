OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of "Huang Lian Jie Du Tang" active fraction (HLJDTAF) on experimental cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was used to observe the protective effect of HLJDTAF on ischemia stroke. Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) rat was used to analyse the effect of HLJDTAF on blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Common carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion repeatedly (CCAORR) in mice were used to test effect of HLJDTAF on gasp time, brain exponential and water content of brain. RESULTS: HLJDTAF could improve the abnormal behavior of MCAO rats and decrease the infarction area (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). HLJDTAF could also significantly prolong the shorten gasp time of CCAORR mice, reduce the brain exponential and decrease the water content in brain (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: HLJDTAF can protect the brain ischemia injury.
