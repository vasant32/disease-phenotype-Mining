We report on two patients with head and neck injuries, who remained asymptomatic after the earthquake for 1 and 2 years, respectively. They developed late transient ischemic neurological signs and eventually presented with complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery. They made a good recovery with medical treatment. Focal cerebral ischemic symptoms may develop months or even years after the head or neck trauma, and internal carotid artery occlusion should be considered in differential diagnosis as a late complication.
