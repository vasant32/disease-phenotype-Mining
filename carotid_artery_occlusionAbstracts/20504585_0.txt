A morphological and functional characterization of the four-vessel occlusion model of transient (30 min) forebrain ischemia has been carried out. The rats were classified as fully ischemic when an isoelectric pattern of electroencephalographic activity was present within 5 min of the occlusion of carotid arteries. Otherwise they were considered as partially ischemic rats. The modifications of cerebral blood content during and after the ischemic insult were assessed by a histochemical method which visualizes red blood cells in cerebral vessels. The periods of increase and decrease of red blood cell content were found to correspond to previous reports of post-ischemic hyper- and hypoperfusion. Neuronal damage was assessed by a quantitative analysis of Nissl stained preparations of cingulate cortex, dorsal hippocampus and striatum. The signs of morphological damage were quantified by means of computer-assisted image analysis of Nissl preparations. The highest vulnerability to the ischemic insult was demonstrated in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampal CA1 field and in the lateral striatum. Arterial blood pressure measurements were performed during the ischemic and post-ischemic periods, demonstrating a peak increase of arterial blood pressure within 2 min after carotid artery occlusion, followed by a slow decrease towards basal levels during the ischemic period and a full recovery within 15 min of reperfusion. Ischemic rats were tested in a neurological test battery and in a passive avoidance task. While a full recovery of the relatively simple tasks of the neurological test battery was attained within 14 days of reperfusion, a highly significant impairment of passive avoidance behavior was still present 15 days after the ischemic insult. Finally, a discriminant analysis was applied to separate, on the basis of non-invasive techniques (neurological tests and hot plate), the group of completely ischemic rats from that of partially ischemic rats.
