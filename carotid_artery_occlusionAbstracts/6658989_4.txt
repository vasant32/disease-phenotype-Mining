The present study was designed to clarify the relationship of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the ischemic brains with or without recirculation, which were produced by clipping of both common carotid arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats. CBF was measured by the hydrogen clearance method and BBB function was evaluated by the permeability of 131I-albumin and Evans blue dye. Cortical CBF was reduced from 48.8 +/- 9.5 to 4.0 +/- 1.2 ml/100 gm/min during 1 hr ischemia and further to 2.6 +/- 0.3 ml/100 gm/min during 3 hrs ischemia, while thalamic CBF was reduced much less from 50.0 +/- 3.6 to 17.9 +/- 6.5 ml/100 gm/min and to 17.5 +/- 11.0 ml/100 gm/min, respectively. There was no increase in permeability to protein tracers observed in such 1 hr or 3 hrs ischemic brain. Both cortical and thalamic CBF were markedly increased 2.5 to 6 fold of resting values at 5 min after recirculation in the 1 hr ischemic brain. In the 3 hrs ischemic brain, however, both CBF were only slightly increased but never restored to the resting level even at 30 min after recirculation. In such reperfused brains, exudation to Evans blue dye was observed in none of 16 animals with 1 hr ischemia, but in 18 of 23 with 3 hrs ischemia. Disruption of BBB was twice more frequent in the cortex (77.8%) than in either thalamus (33.3%) or hippocampus (33.3%). Permeability index of 131I-albumin (brain albumin/blood albumin) was significantly higher in the ischemic areas stained with blue dye (2.07 +/- 0.45%) than in non-ischemic control brain (0.10 +/- 0.01%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
