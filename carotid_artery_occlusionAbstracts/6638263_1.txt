In summary, internal carotid artery occlusion can be reliably diagnosed by noninvasive techniques, particularly when complementary studies such as B-mode imaging, oculopneumoplethysmography and Doppler frequency spectral analysis are used in combination. Our data suggest that it may also be possible to distinguish acute thrombosis from chronic occlusion by real-time ultrasonography, although further evaluation is necessary. Additional clinically important information about the ipsilateral external carotid artery and the contralateral internal carotid artery is also obtained with this combination of noninvasive studies. Finally, although internal carotid artery occlusion remains a therapeutic challenge to the clinician, its noninvasive diagnosis may be of great help in planning early therapy and in determining arteriographic needs.
