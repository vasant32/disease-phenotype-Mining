The Japanese authors first described encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, a new treatment for moya-moya disease, 17 years ago. The other authors used this method (EDAS, indirect anastomosis) in surgical treatment of patients suffered cerebral transient ischaemic attack and cerebral ischaemia. In our department this method was applied in 5 patients with cerebral ischaemia. All patients had internal carotid artery occlusion. After angiography, to localize carotid artery occlusion, acetazolamid (Diamox) test was performed. The patients with negative Diamox test were treated surgically (EDAS). The authors used the intraoperative microdoppler device to monitor blood flow velocity of the prepared vessel (temporal superficial artery) at every stage of surgery. The device was also useful in controlling the patency of encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis percutaneously after the surgery. The proximal and the distal part of the non-bypass anastomosis was examined in the follow up during 5-8 months before angiography.
