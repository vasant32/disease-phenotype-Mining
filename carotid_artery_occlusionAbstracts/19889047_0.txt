 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: acute ischemic stroke (AIS) may occur both in the acute and chronic internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAo). Thus, it is important to assess the ICAo character when considering the recanalization method. The aim was to assess the agreement between the ultrasonographic (US) and perioperative macroscopic (PM) finding in AIS patients with acute ICAo, undergoing an emergent carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: in a retrospective, hospital-based study, the set consisted of 47 patients (36 males; age 49-79, mean 63.7 ± 8.5 years). ICAo character was classified as an acute thromboembolus either isolated or in combination with atherosclerotic plaque using the US (B-mode) and the PM evaluation. Cohen's Kappa and AC(1) coefficient were applied to assess the methods agreement. RESULTS: an acute ICAo character diagnosed by US was confirmed by the PM evaluation in all cases. US and PM findings were consistent in 41 cases. The agreement between both methods in the classification of acute ICAo was 87.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 77.7-96.8%], κ= .589 (95% CI: .293-.885) (P < .0001), AC(1) = .815. CONCLUSIONS: US is a reliable method in the diagnostics of the acute character of ICAo and it has a good agreement with PM finding regarding a differentiation of atherosclerotic plaque and fresh thromboembolus.
