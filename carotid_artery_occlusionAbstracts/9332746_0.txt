Although temporary occlusion of the carotid arteries is commonly done to reduce blood loss during nasal surgery in the dog, data supporting its use are mostly anecdotal and subjective. Twelve dogs were placed under general inhalation anesthesia and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnea and an end-tidal halothane concentration equivalent to 1.3 times the minimum alveolar concentration. Tourniquets were placed around both carotid arteries of each dog. Both lingual arteries were cannulated in each dog and their heart rate and blood pressure were measured bilaterally. During unilateral carotid artery occlusion, the blood pressures in the ipsilateral lingual artery were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the preocclusion control pressures and pressures recorded in the contralateral vessel. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion resulted in a further significant (P < 0.05) fall in all lingual arterial pressures. The recorded heart rates only varied significantly from preocclusion control values when they increased during bilateral carotid occlusion (P < 0.05). The results of this study confirm that carotid artery occlusion has the potential to reduce intraoperative blood loss during oronasal surgery in the dog.
