Distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-positive neurons of cingulate areas and its changes following bilateral common carotid artery occlusion were investigated with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate diaphoras (NADPH-d) reaction. Positively stained NOS-neurons were observed in the areas 24, 32, and 25 of the anterior cingulate cortex, and in the areas 23 and 29 of the posterior cingulate cortex. After bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, the results showed that the NOS-positive neurons increased markedly in the areas 24, 32, 25, 23 and 29 of the cingulate cortex (P < 0.01).
