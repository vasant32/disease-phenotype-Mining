The uptake of labelled uridine is reduced in the whole ischaemic hemispheres of gerbils subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion. Following circulatory restoration, brain structures that had an ischaemic insult of moderate intensity exhibit a progressively increased uptake. However, during reperfusion there is a tendency towards a clear cut definition of dead zones. This progression of the lesions seems to be related to a maturation phenomenon occurring in areas with an irreversible damage at the end of the ischaemic period.
