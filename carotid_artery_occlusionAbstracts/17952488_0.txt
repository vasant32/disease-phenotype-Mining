BACKGROUND: An occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) is considered a "safe artery" as it causes few symptoms. However, it has recently been suggested that spontaneous recanalisation of ICA occlusions may occur. AIM: To determine the incidence of ICA recanalisation among patients with a previously documented occluded ICA. METHODS: Patients with a documented ICA occlusion between September 2001 and January 2003 were identified. Patients who consented to participate had carotid duplex scans performed. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analyses were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: The total number of carotid duplex scans performed during the original study period was 719. An occluded ICA was identified in 30 (4.2%) patients. Of 19 patients who were rescanned two (11%) had recanalised a previously occluded ICA. CONCLUSIONS: Recanalisation occurs in a small number of patients who may need long-term surveillance.
