The CBF measurements (Xenon-133, inhalation technique) and quantified EEG (qEEG) recordings of 20 patients with cerebrovascular disturbances due to an unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion were evaluated. One of the advantages of the inhalation method is the possibility of the simultaneous CBF measurement of both hemispheres. Special attention is paid to the difference in flow between the two hemispheres. The results of this investigation are compared with the findings of the qEEG studies. Furthermore the relationship between these results and the clinical state of the patient was studied. Although computer analysis revealed EEG abnormalities in 80% of the cases no correlation could be found between the grade of EEG abnormalities and the clinical data of the patient and/or the CBF parameters. A correlation was found between the asymmetry as well as the absolute values of the hemispheric flow and the clinical state. The question whether CBF measurements can provide a better insight into the pathophysiology of the blood flow pattern in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery occlusions was considered as well.
