Subclavian-cortical middle cerebral artery bypass by saphenous vein interposition is an uncommon recent revascularization technique used for immediate volume flow to the brain or when donor arteries are unavailable or inadequate. We used this technique in four cases of symptomatic common carotid artery occlusion. In the last two cases, severe, reversible neurological complications occurred. We think that these complications are due to this particular technique, and more cautious indications than for traditional extra-intracranial arterial bypass are recommended.
