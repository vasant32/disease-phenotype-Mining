Although the association between elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level and long-term outcome after ischemic stroke is well known, the association between CRP and early neurologic deterioration (END) has not yet been thoroughly studied. We investigated the impact of CRP on END in patients with acute ischemic stroke. From a prospectively collected, multicenter stroke registry, 428 patients with acute ischemic stroke diagnosed within 24 hours of onset were enrolled in the study. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and thrombolysis were excluded. END was defined as a >2-point increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score within a 72-hour period. Data considered potentially associated with CRP level and the END were collected. END was observed in 47 patients. CRP level, time before arrival at the hospital, age, female sex, hematocrit, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, hemoglobin A(1c) level, and internal carotid artery occlusion were significantly associated with END. On logistic regression analysis, CRP level, internal carotid artery occlusion, and HDL cholesterol proved to be independent variables. Our data suggest that CRP level at admission is significantly associated with END in acute ischemic stroke. HDL cholesterol and internal carotid artery occlusion are also associated with END.
