In the presence of internal carotid artery occlusion, external carotid artery disease can produce neurological symptoms either by reducing flow in the collateral vessels to the circle of Willis, or by acting as a source for embolic disease. Five cases are described to illustrate the clinical presentations possible in this situation, and to demonstrate the symptomatic relief afforded by correctly selected external carotid endarterectomy.
