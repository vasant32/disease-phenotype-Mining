We report the case of a 54-year-old man with acute stroke caused by left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion secondary to pleural mesothelioma, discovered later. The cranial computed tomography scan revealed a left hemisphere ischemic lesion. At neurological examination, the modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) score was 9. The carotid duplex scan (DS) showed a complete thrombotic occlusion of the left ICA. The patient underwent emergency carotid thrombectomy. The screening tests revealed thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia, increased C-reactive protein values, and multiple left pleural mesothelioma nodularity confirmed at the immunohistochemical investigation. After surgery, the patient's neurological symptoms improved, with an mNIHSS score of 3. At 30 and 120 days, the DS follow-up showed regular patency of the ICA.
