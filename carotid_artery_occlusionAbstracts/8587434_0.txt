The role of endogenous endothelins (ETs) in mediating postischemic hypoperfusion after transient global ischemia was investigated in halothane-anesthetized rats. Pretreatment with the broad spectrum ETA and ETB antagonist bosentan (17 mumol/kg) had minimal effect on postischemic hypoperfusion, as measured by hydrogen clearance, in the caudate nucleus and the parietal cortex during 3 h after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with concomitant hemorrhagic hypotension (transient global ischemia). In cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 90 min after carotid occlusion with concomitant hemorrhagic hypotension, bosentan treatment failed to alter CBF in any of the cerebral cortical regions examined. No changes in CBF, as measured by hydrogen clearance, were observed after transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. [14C]Iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 90 min post occlusion failed to demonstrate any increases in cerebral blood flow after transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in any of the 35 brain regions examined in anesthetized rats.
