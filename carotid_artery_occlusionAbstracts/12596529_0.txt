The tests on rats with common carotid artery occlusion showed that bilobil increases the cerebral blood flow and decreases brain edema, thus decreasing the loss of experimental animals. The drug also increases the blood circulation and improves the excretory function of kidneys. Under clinical conditions, bilobil increases the cerebral blood flow, normalizes the metal ligand homeostasis, and improves the antioxidant status in children with early forms of cerebrovascular disease (neurocirculate distonia) and attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome.
