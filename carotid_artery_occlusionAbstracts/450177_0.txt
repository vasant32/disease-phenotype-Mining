The rheoencephalographic method was applied for evaluating the common carotid artery compression test in 87 cases, including 49 patients with ischaemic strokes and 38 healthy subjects. In all 174 tests were done. No complications were observed. The investigation confirmed the usefulness of the test for the diagnosis of carotid artery occlusion. The test should be used routinely in rheoencephalographic investigations in patients with ischaemic cerebral strokes.
