BACKGROUND: Sudden internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive vasospasm is a serious complication of intracranial aneurysm embolization. Conventional spasmolysis with papaverine yields a generally poor outcome. We believe that arterial infusion of lidocaine may offer a better outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of patients treated with either papaverine or lidocaine infusion for vasospasm during embolization. RESULTS: 14 patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm embolization had a ICA occlusive vasospasm. Among the 8 patients who received conventional treatment with papaverine the vasospasm improved partially in 5. In 3 cases, treatment was ineffective. 6 of the patients died within 3 days. 2 patients developed hemispheric infarction and underwent a decompressive craniectomy and subtotal resection of the infarct; 1 of these 2 patients died after 4 months and the other was severely disabled. In the 6 patients treated with lidocaine, spasmolysis and subsequent aneurysm treatment was succesful in 5. In 1 patient who had preoperative stenosis of the carotid artery proximal to the aneurysm spasmolysis failed. CONCLUSIONS: ICA occlusive spasm is an extremely serious and often lethal complication in embolization of intracranial aneurysms. Conventional treatment with papaverine has a poor outcome, whereas arterial infusion of lidocaine may achieve better results.
