Ocular ischemic syndrome is a chronic ischemic eye disease including a series of ischemic ocular and brain syndromes caused by carotid artery occlusion or stenosis. Because of the different degrees of ischemia, clinical manifestations of ocular ischemic syndrome are diverse, and it is difficult to diagnose in the initial stage. The main strategy to treat ocular ischemic syndrome is elimination of carotid stenosis. We presented a patient who recovered dramatically after carotid artery stenting. The pre-stenting arm-retinal circulation time of the patientâ€™s left eye was prolonged, and a large amount of microaneurysm appeared at the posterior polar and mid-peripheral aspects of the left retina. The post-stenting arm-retinal circulation time of the left eye decreased to 16.3 seconds, and the microaneurysm almost disappeared.
