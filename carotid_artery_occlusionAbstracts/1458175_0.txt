In rat experiments during brain ischemia (30-min carotid artery occlusion), ethomersol administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 50 mg/kg before occlusion or at the end of ischemia eliminated postischemic hypoperfusion. The effect of the drug was due to its spasmolytic and antiaggregatory activities. An analysis of the vasodilating action of ethomersol revealed its capacity to block potential-dependent calcium channels and partially intracellular calcium mobilization when the adrenergic and serotoninergic receptors were activated. The antiaggregatory activity of the drug appeared as inhibited platelet aggregation, which was induced by ADP, serotonin, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and as enhanced antiaggregatory activity of the vascular wall.
