We investigated whether postischemic brain hypothermia (30 degrees C) would permanently protect the hippocampus following global forebrain ischemia. Global ischemia was produced in anesthetized rats by bilateral carotid artery occlusion plus hypotension (50 mm Hg). In the postischemic hypothermic group, brain temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C during the 10-min ischemic insult but reduced to 30 degrees C starting 3 min into the recirculation period and maintained at 30 degrees C for 3 h. In normothermic animals, intra- and postischemic brain temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C. After recovery for 3 days, 7 days, or 2 months, the extent of CA1 hippocampal histologic injury was quantitated. At 3 days after ischemia, postischemic hypothermia significantly protected the hippocampal CA1 sector compared with normothermic animals. For example, within the medial, middle, and lateral CA1 subsectors, the numbers of normal neurons were increased 20-, 13-, and 9-fold by postischemic hypothermia (p < 0.01). At 7 days after the ischemic insult, however, the degree of postischemic hypothermic protection was significantly reduced. In this case, the numbers of normal neurons were increased an average of only threefold compared with normothermia. Ultrastructural analysis of 7-day postischemic hypothermic rats demonstrated CA1 pyramidal neurons showing variable degrees of injury surrounded by reactive astrocytes and microglial cells. At 2 months after the ischemic insult, no trend for protection was demonstrated. In contrast to postischemic hypothermia, significant protection was seen at 2 months following intraischemic hypothermia. These data indicate that intraischemic, but not postischemic, brain hypothermia provides chronic protection to the hippocampus after transient brain ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
