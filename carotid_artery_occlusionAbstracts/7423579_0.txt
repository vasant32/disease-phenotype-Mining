The angiographic appearance of the proximal end of internal carotid artery occlusion is reported in 41 patients with acute stroke in the areas of the brain supplied by the carotid artery. All patients had angiography within 6 days of stroke onset, the majority within 24--48 hours. Three angiographic configurations of internal carotid occlusion were found, in descending order of frequency: a sharp, pointed stump; virtual absence of the artery; and a rounded, blunt stump. The results suggest that the angiographic appearance of the proximal occlusion alone may not accurately predict the age of the occlusion within the first 6 days from stroke onset.
