<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 9 patients with clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> or infarction who had altered vesicourethral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the patients 6 had some preservation of bladder and lower extremity sensation, a clinical pattern consistent with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3 patients had a clinical picture more consistent with complete transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, since they had no preservation of bladder or lower extremity sensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite sensory levels well above the sacral spinal cord segments, 6 patients had detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> (4 with bethanechol supersensitivity and 4 with neuropathic changes in the perineal electromyograph) indicating longitudinal spinal cord involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> with vesicosphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo>, indicating some preservation of the sacral spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients appreciation of pinprick in the lower extremities was absent or decreased but light touch or position sense was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bladder sensation was dissociated in 4 of these 6 patients, since they had perception of bladder distention but loss of urge to void </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that bladder distention is a sensory modality probably mediated via the posterior spinal cord, while the sense of urgency is probably conveyed by the anterior spinal cord </plain></SENT>
