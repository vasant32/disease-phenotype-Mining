<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Long-term positive pressure mechanical ventilation has been the standard of care for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> caused by high cervical spine injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the phrenic nerves, and thus the diaphragm, with an implanted phrenic nerve pacemaker has provided adequate ventilation and an alternative to the standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diaphragmatic pacing, also known as electrophrenic respiration, requires an intact phrenic nerve to act as a conduit for the applied stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Propagation of the stimulus is impossible if the injury sustained has led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> in the phrenic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may be expected if the damage to the spinal cord is at the C3-C5 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the cell bodies of the motor neurons in this region have been damaged, or direct injury to the phrenic nerve has occurred, then diaphragmatic pacing is not feasible by the traditional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical repair of peripheral nerves and nerve grafting have provided the impetus for research into anastomosis of a viable intercostal nerve to a nonfunctional phrenic nerve, with subsequent reinnervation of the diaphragm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> and diaphragmatic reinnervation have occurred, the distal phrenic nerve may then be paced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case documents the first successful institution of electrophrenic respiration after intercostal to phrenic nerve anastomosis </plain></SENT>
