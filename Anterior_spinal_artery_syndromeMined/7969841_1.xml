<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old boy with a history of 2 years of flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and rectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> after two spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> was encountered in August 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through extensive physical and neuroradiological investigation, an association was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants with aortic arch interruption die within the first month of life, this older patient gave us an opportunity to study the collateral network and the effect of hemodynamic abnormality on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For treatment, we believe that surgery should be directed to the hemodynamic abnormality of the aortic arch interruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After bypass surgery from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta with an artificial vessel graft, the patient had some neurological improvement, as demonstrated by the sensation level lowering from T7 to L1 </plain></SENT>
