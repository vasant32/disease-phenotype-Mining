<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensory pathways were continuously monitored from skin incision to awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases intraoperative SEPs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the wake-up test revealed no neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients were presented with incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo>) three and ten hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Without delay, both patients underwent revision surgery, and the CD instrumentation was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after surgery, both patients' motor power in their lower extremities improved rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases with delayed ASAS after posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> correction, the removal of the instrumentation system was shown to be sufficient to regain full motor recovery caudal to the level of impairment </plain></SENT>
