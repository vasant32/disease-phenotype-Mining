<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the anatomic basis for the unusual presentation in a spinal cord injured subject of preservation of motor power in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was examined at four hours, and daily thereafter, after a motorcycle accident in which he was thrown over the handle bars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had trace ankle dorsi and plantar flexors, but light touch, pin, position, and vibratory sensation were absent below the level of C4 bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no physical evidence to differentiate whether he suffered a flexion or extension injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cervical spine films showed no evidence of fracture or dislocation, but anterior and posterior osteophytes involving C3 to C4, C4 to C5, and C5 to C6 were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of cervical cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at C3 to C4 with possible <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> at C3 to C4 and C4 to C5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient received a compression injury with resulting classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> with a decreased anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the canal, the posterior circulation was also compromised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extensive pial anastomotic network provided relative sparing of the most peripheral components of the lateral corticospinal tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case report demonstrates a unique clinical picture that cannot be anatomically classified by current American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards as central cord syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be explained by the lamination of the ascending and descending tracts in relation to the vascular supply of the cervical cord in conjunction with the narrowing of the AP diameter of the canal due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
