<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, where it is observed most frequently after resection of thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, spinal magnetic resonance imaging is considered the first-line investigation to confirm the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 3-year-old male who presented with this syndrome after palliative cardiac surgery for a complex cardiac malformation associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of anterior horn cell impairment below the L2 level was confirmed by electromyography and F-wave studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sparing of dorsal sensory tracts was documented by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> somatosensory-evoked potentials, which confirmed the anterior localization of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spinal magnetic resonance imaging performed on day 15 and day 105 after surgery was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficits, including flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, remained stable except for the reappearance of patellar reflexes on day 83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiologic conduction studies were consistent with lower motoneuron loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging was less sensitive in demonstrating spinal cord lesion than clinical neurophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory-evoked potentials failed to detect the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevention may therefore require other neurophysiologic monitoring techniques </plain></SENT>
