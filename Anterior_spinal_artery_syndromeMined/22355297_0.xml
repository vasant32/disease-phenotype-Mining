<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus following oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was characterised by loss of sensation from the spinal level T2 down to T6, together with flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> of both lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was initially thought to be secondary to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural haematoma</z:hpo> and a magnetic resonance scan was arranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggested changes consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> from D2 to D6 with no haematoma or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This severe complication was most probably caused by embolisation from an atherosclerotic plaque of the thoracic aorta, as the nature of the surgery requires aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may have consequently led to occlusion of a significant part of the spinal blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> is a well known problem in the operative management of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, this complication is extremely rare after oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
