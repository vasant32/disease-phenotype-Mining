<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical evolution and the functional outcome of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> who were treated at the Spinal Cord Injuries Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To try to determine the factors that could have influence in their functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: In a Spinal Cord Injuries Unit, regionally-based, and which forms part of a general hospital with a high level of specialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective study of the medical records of patients suffering from vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e>, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> or associated with aortic surgery or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases that were due to compressive, tumoral or inflammatory pathologies were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the neurological syndrome followed the ASIA/IMSOP criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, history and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessment of functional outcome was made regarding ambulatory ability or wheelchair use, and bladder/sphincter control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six cases were selected, the commonest group being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> due to idiopathic causes (36.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following these, there were cases associated with aortic surgery (25%), systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (19.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> deficit of perfusion (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 59.3 years, with a mortality of 22.2% during the hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding the functional outcomes at the moment of discharge, it must be pointed out that 57.1% of the patients were wheelchair users, 25% were ambulatory, using technical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e>, and 17.9% were fully ambulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The group who could perform some kind of walking was significantly younger than the group of wheelchair users (48.17 vs 61.38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it became evident that those patients who did not show voluntary muscle contraction at the time of admission (ASIA groups A and B) presented a higher risk of being wheelchair users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> syndrome has a severe prognosis with permanent and disabling sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Initial neurological assessment following ASIA/IMSOP classification proves to be the best predictor of prognosis, and the patient's advanced age constitutes a negative factor for functional recovery </plain></SENT>
