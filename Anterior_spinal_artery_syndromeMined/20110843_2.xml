<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a cement embolism in the anterior spinal artery after vertebroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is commonly performed for the management of pain associated with benign compression fractures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, vertebral metastatic lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a severe complication associated with this procedure; a similar complication has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 63-year-old woman suffered from persistent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> that radiated to both sides of the chest wall 1 week before medical consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the thoracolumbar spine revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002756'>pathologic fracture</z:hpo> in the body of the T9 and T10 vertebrae, with <z:mp ids='MP_0010323'>retropulsion</z:mp> into the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord at the T10 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed decompressive laminectomy of the T9-10 vertebrae with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy and vertebroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediately after the operation, the patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and loss of sensitivity to pain/temperature; however, deep pressure sensation and 2-point discrimination below the umbilicus (T10 level) were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans showed the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53205">PMMA</z:chebi> in T9 and T10, with opacification of the paravertebral vessels, the left intercostal artery at the T10 level, and a segment of the anterior spinal artery at the T10-11 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present the first report describing a case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a cement embolism in the anterior spinal artery after vertebroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The severity of this complication warrants that surgeons should inform patients of the same while obtaining their consent for vertebroplasty </plain></SENT>
