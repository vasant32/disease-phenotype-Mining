<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her affliction was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> because of flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010835'>dissociated sensory loss</z:hpo> below the Th4 dermatome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological study indicated a compensated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> and hepatic enzyme abnormality, while the CSF examinations showed an elevation of protein and positive myelin basic protein (MBP) elevation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sagittal T2-weighted image (T2) revealed central high intensity (HI) with longitudinal extension from Th2 through the Th11 vertebral level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On axial T2, HI was located on the gray matter at the Th3 and Th4 vertebral level, the ventral two-thirds at the Th8 vertebral level, the central ventral side at the Th9 and Th10 vertebral level, and the entire cross section at the Th12 and L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A follow-up MRI examination showed that the range of HI on the sagittal T2 had been reduced to 5 segments from Th6 through Th10 vertebral level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The T2 HI lesion on the axial aspect had become reduced so as to localize on the left ventral side at the Th8 vertebral level and on the central ventral side at Th9 and Th10 </plain></SENT>
