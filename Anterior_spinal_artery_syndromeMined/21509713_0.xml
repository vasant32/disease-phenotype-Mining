<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deep sensibility is not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 13-year-old male patient presented to our emergency department with a bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 week before, he had suffered a leg strain in a Taekwondo-fight from which he recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On physical examination our patient's legs were in flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, tone was decreased and he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010835'>dissociated sensory loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> retention of urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood count, ESR, electrolytes, serologic tests for various pathogens and CSF examination <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, tests for values of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> endothelial lesion were increased and he was a homozygous carrier of MTHFR-polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI performed on the day of admission was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but showed dramatic changes 2 days later with increased signal intensity in the ventral aspect of the spinal cord, characteristic for an ASAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment included highdose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, a suprapubic bladder catheter, sufficient anticoagulation and a rapid transfer to a rehabilitation centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We assume that a combination of the patient's prothrombotic risk factor (MTHFR-polymorphism with elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels) and his trauma in the taekwondo-fight with consecutive vessel injury caused an occlusion of the artery by late emboli or a growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
