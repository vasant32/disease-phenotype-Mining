<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Ischemic spinal cord <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is the most frequent vascular lesion, but although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> are a possible cause, it is unusual for such cases to be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as the first sign of the dissection of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 58 year old man was seen in the hospital Emergency Department complaining of lumbar pain and the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> of the legs, associated with pain in the middle of his back but with no history of previous trauma or effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only relevant personal history was of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whilst he was in the Neurology Department, the anomaly was diagnosed after dorsal, and lumbar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), when a zone of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> at T9-T10 was seen and, as a casual observation, an image compatible with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the dissection of the aorta and the neurological complications may be explained by a clear understanding of the vascular supply to the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, both the clinical findings and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> were clearly indicative of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In spite of its rarity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> should be included in the differential diagnosis of a clinical picture of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, especially when there is lumbar and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> before the appearance of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is important for this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
