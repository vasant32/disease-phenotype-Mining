<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several techniques and agents are used to control the hemodynamic response and minimize adverse effects triggered by surgical stimuli in patients undergoing cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This is a 70 years old male patient, 1.74 m, 75 kg, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> III, and NYHA II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had controlled dyslipedemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>type II diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; history of smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 20 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent revascularization with the left internal mammary artery and saphenous grafts with extracorporeal circulation with intermittent clamping of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 24 hours in the ICU, the patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e>, sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six hours after the end of the surgery, the patient was awake, hemodynamically stable, and with good respiratory dynamics, being extubated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was talkative and oriented, but immobile and negative reflexes in the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological evaluation showed: cranial nerves without changes, no complaints of pain below the hips, preserved superficial and deep sensitivity, adequate distal perfusion without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> below T8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The echocardiogram did not show any changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT scan of the lumbosacral spine was negative for compressive mass in the epidural space or adjacent to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> should be considered in procedures with manipulation of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prevention, especially in patients at risk, is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography, for the differential diagnosis, and MRI, to localize the lesion, are important </plain></SENT>
