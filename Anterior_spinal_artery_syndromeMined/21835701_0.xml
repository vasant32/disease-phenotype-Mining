<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebroplasty is commonly performed for the management of pain associated with benign compression fractures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, vertebral metastatic lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a severe complication associated with this procedure; only one previous case has been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a direct cement leakage in the arterial vessels after vertebroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 20-year-old man who has been diagnosed with multifocal Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> for 5Â months suffered from severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthralgia</z:e> in the left knee, pelvis, and the low back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imaging studies, X-ray and computed tomography scan, showed the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002756'>pathologic fractures</z:hpo> of T8 and L1 vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:mp ids='MP_0010323'>retropulsion</z:mp> of bony fragment in the vertebral canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A percutaneous vertebroplasty of T8 and L1 level was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediately after the procedure, the patient experienced a total <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature in both lower limbs; however, deep pressure sensation and two-point discrimination below the umbilicus were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans showed no leakage of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53205">polymethylmethacrylate</z:chebi> of T8 and L1 vertebral bodies, with opacification of the right intercostal artery at the L1 level and a segment of the anterior spinal artery at the T10-L1 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although percutaneous vertebroplasty has many benefits, including its simplicity and relative safety, it could lead to serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current case demonstrates the direct leakage of cement within the anterior spinal artery leading to an irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinicians should be aware of such complications to happen and explain it to their patients </plain></SENT>
