<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> with sensory dissociation was developed in this patient after surgery, despite well maintained ESPs throughout the aortic cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ESPs have been widely used as a mean of detecting early impairment of spinal neural conduction during aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, ESPs are principally mediated through posterior and lateral column pathways and they are not always a reliable monitor to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
