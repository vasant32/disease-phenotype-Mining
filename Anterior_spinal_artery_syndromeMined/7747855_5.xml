<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with compromised cardiovascular and respiratory function undergoing thoracic or major abdominal surgery can benefit significantly intra-operatively from a combination of general anaesthesia and regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The continued use of regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> into the postoperative period offers even more advantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>General anaesthesia administered before regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> may, however, mask complications related to the regional technique and delay the instigation of corrective measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood supply to the anterior part of the spinal cord, through the artery of Adamkiewicz, may be impaired intra-operatively leading to neurological sequelae known as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e>, characterised by loss of motor function with intact or partially intact sensory function </plain></SENT>
