<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In his history, he had received an aortoiliac Y-prothesis for a ruptured retroperitoneal intrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> 39 months previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostically, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed advanced degenerative changes with osseous stenoses in segments C5-6 and less pronounced on C6-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the computerized tomogram of the neurocranium were consistent with the patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The computerized tomogram of the chest and abdomen revealed a left outward bulge in the descending branch of the thoracic artery that was almost 20 mm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the differential diagnosis, this was interpreted as an aneurysmatic sacculation with wall <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or a locally circumscribed intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> upon dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic testing by conduction of magnet-evoked potentials showed no lesions of the pyramidal tract to the extremities above the lumbosacral level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lumbosacral stimulation evoked potentials on both sides whereas cortical stimulation did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the patient's history, the clinical findings and additional tests, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> was rendered although its cause could not be determined with certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The previous transitory ischemic attack and the varying course of the disease is very exceptional in the presented case </plain></SENT>
