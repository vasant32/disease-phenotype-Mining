<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mild type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> (ASAS) is characterized by motor loss with an absent or insignificant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the anterior horn of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms of cervical spondylotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> (CSA) are motor loss or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with an absent or insignificant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> or a long tract sign; however, the pathophysiology has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients who suffered from palsy of the deltoid and biceps brachii are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the intrinsic cord disease as the cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the central motor conduction time (CMCT) and the latencies of the tendon reflex (T waves) of the biceps and triceps and those of the F waves of the abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi before, 2 weeks after, and 3 months after starting intravenous injections of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(1) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In these 3 cases, restoration of muscle strength began after starting injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiologic diagnosis revealed a disturbance of the motor conduction, in the CMCT and the latencies of the T waves, in the paretic muscle, which is more severe than that in other muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The radiological diagnosis suggested damage in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the disturbance of the motor conduction and those of symptoms were parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From symptomatologic or radiological viewpoints, it is difficult to differentiate CSA from ASAS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>cervical spondylosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there have been patients with ASAS whom we have diagnosed as CSA, and we may add administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) to the treatment for the patients with CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present 3 patients showed improvement of muscle strength after starting injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although this improvement was measured by an electrophysiologic method, the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(1) require further study </plain></SENT>
