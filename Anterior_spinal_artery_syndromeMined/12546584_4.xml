<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1999 and 2001, 14 patients (12 men; mean age 60.3 years, range 39-79) with isolated type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>) underwent aortic stent-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical picture and were managed emergently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left subclavian artery was intentionally covered by the prosthesis in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies were performed at 6-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stent-graft implantation was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but incomplete sealing (endoleak) of the entry site required additional proximal stent-graft implantation in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left subclavian artery remained patent in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary conversion was required in 3 patients: 2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection resulting from injury to the aortic arch by Talent endografts and a sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (left <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another patient, a secondary intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> subsided spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> in 1 patient persisted at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No bypass was necessary for the 9 patients with the covered left subclavian arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 14 months (range 1-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-grafting is feasible in patients with type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, although it is associated with a considerable rate of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Frank reporting of these sequelae for a variety of stent-grafts is of paramount importance to clarifying the limitations of the method </plain></SENT>
