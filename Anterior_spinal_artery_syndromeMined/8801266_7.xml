<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate history taking revealed micturitional symptoms in 95 patients, including irritative symptoms in 61 and obstructive symptoms in 71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>Urinary incontinence</z:hpo> was noted in 25 and residual urine of over 100 ml or retention was found in 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed disturbed deep sensation in 55, disturbed superficial sensation in 63 and pyramidal signs (<z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> of legs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo>) in 96 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urodynamic studies revealed uninhibited contraction in 61 and detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bladder capacity was smaller in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) and in patients with uninhibited contraction (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uninhibited contraction was more frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of the above-mentioned pyramidal signs (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> was more frequent in patients with disturbed deep sensation (P &lt; 0.05) and pyramidal signs (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From above results and our previous findings in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039223" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tabes dorsalis</z:e>, it is concluded that the pathway subserving detrusor function seems to be located mainly in the lateral column of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The descending pathway subserving coordination of bladder and urethral sphincter seems to be located mainly in the lateral column, and its ascending pathway seems to be located in the dorsal column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The path subserving urinary sensation seems to be located mainly in the dorsal column of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
