<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have investigated the hypothesis that loss of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adventitial exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was studied angiographically by injecting purified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> solution or autologous whole blood into the cisterna magna of anesthetized pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both interventions induced intra- but not extracerebral vasoconstriction, which persisted for 2 and 7 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP) levels were measured in isolated buffer-perfused pig intrathecal arteries to quantify inhibition of basal EDRF activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adventitial exposure was less effective than intimal exposure, 10 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> applied adventitially for 30 minutes having an effect equivalent to that of 1 microM applied intraluminally for 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of cGMP levels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was reversible and equivalent to the effect of endothelial denudation or incubation with NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, so that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> can be attributed to a specific action on EDRF rather than interaction with a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-like substance produced by vascular smooth muscle or adventitial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> levels in isolated arteries were unchanged after in vivo exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> for either 2 or 7 days or to whole blood for 2 days, and were reduced by intraluminal perfusion with 1 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after 7 days of in vivo exposure to whole blood, cGMP levels were already depressed, and not further reduced by intraluminal perfusion with 1 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings support the view that adventitially applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> can inhibit basal EDRF activity and that in vivo adventitial exposure to whole blood leads to a reduction in basal cGMP levels in association with vasoconstriction of intrathecal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both mechanisms could contribute to the clinical syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
