<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most potent vasoconstrictor known, endothelin-1, is currently considered to mediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), which can cause delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we performed clinical and in vitro experiments to investigate the origin and the mechanisms of the secretion of endothelin-1 in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelin-1 and markers of inflammatory host response (interleukin [IL]-1ss, IL-6, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha) were comparatively quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SAH patients and control subjects, and concentrations were related to clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mononuclear leukocytes isolated from the CSF of SAH patients and control subjects were analyzed regarding their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of endothelin-1 and inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, complementary in vitro experiments were performed to investigate whether coincubation of blood and CSF can trigger leukocytic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and release of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activated mononuclear leukocytes in the CSF of SAH patients synthesize and release endothelin-1 in parallel with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants (IL-1ss, IL-6, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complementary in vitro experiments not only further confirmed this leukocytic origin of endothelin-1 but also showed that aging and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of blood is sufficient to induce such endothelin-1 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration that endothelin-1 is produced by activated CSF mononuclear leukocytes suggests that subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may represent a therapeutic target to prevent vasospasm and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after SAH </plain></SENT>
