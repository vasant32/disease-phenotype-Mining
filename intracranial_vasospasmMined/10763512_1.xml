<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of ET-1 in non-muscle compaction (another aspect of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>) has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to demonstrate the effect of ET-1, as well as erythrocyte lysate and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), on fibroblast populated collagen lattice (FPCL) compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human dermal fibroblasts were used to form FPCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration-dependent effect of ET-1 was examined in the absence and presence of an <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (BQ-485), or an ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (BQ-788), or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FPCL compaction was determined by measuring reduction of areas over five days following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To compare the effect of ET-1 on lattice compaction, erythrocyte lysate and bloody CSF obtained from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> patient were also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that ET-1 increased FPCL compaction in a concentration-dependent (but not time-dependent) manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate produced the strongest compaction, however, without time-dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bloody CSF promoted FPCL compaction in a time-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compaction induced by ET-1 was inhibited by BQ-485 but not by BQ-788 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that ET-1 promotes FPCL compaction by activation of <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other components in bloody CSF or erythrocytes may also contribute to FPCL compaction </plain></SENT>
