<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no experimental or clinical study investigating the comparative effects of routine treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 35 male New Zealand White rabbits were assigned randomly to one of seven groups: Control, only SAH, SAH/oral nimodipine, SAH/IV nimodipine, SAH/IT nimodipine, SAH/IA nimodipine, SAH/angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: basilar artery vessel diameters are measured by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameters and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> sectional areas are measured in pathology slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery thicknesses were significantly higher in group 2 and 7 than the others (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> sectional areas in group 5 and 6 were significantly higher than other groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference in group 1, 5 and 6 (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basilar section areas in group 3 and 4 were significantly higher than group 2 but lower than group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: this is the first study to show the most effective drug delivery route in CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study showed that selective IA nimodipine treatment and IT nimodipine treatment must be preferred to IV and oral treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
