<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effects of intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi>/nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> complex (SPER/NO) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an experimental model of SAH were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits (2.6-3.4 kg in weight) were randomly divided into four groups (n=6), as follows: (I) control group (without SAH and drug), (II) SAH alone group (with SAH, without drug), (III) SAH placebo group (with SAH and saline), and (IV) SAH-SPER/NO group (with SAH and SPER/NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fresh autologous non-heparinized blood was injected into the cisterna magna to induce a SAH, after 24 hour SAH, the substance (saline or SPER/NO) was delivered to animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rabbits were scarified at 48-hours of induced SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery with surrounding tissue was removed from the cranium and processed for paraffin embedding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological and stereological examinations of the basilar artery were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In the SPER/NO treated group of rabbits, the histopathological changes were less severe than in the SAH-alone and SAH-placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding the intracarotid pressure, there was a statistically significant difference between SAH-alone and SAH-SPER/NO groups and also between SAH-SPER/NO and control groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean cross sectional area of basilar arteries was 0.26 mm(2) in the control, whereas in SAH alone, placebo and SAH-SPER/NO groups were 0.13, 0.15 and 0.20 mm(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: It is well known that NO is a critical substance involved in cerebral vascular dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Present results indicate that treatment of vasospasm with SPER/NO in SAH may be promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further studies should be done on this substance to clarify its effect on vasospasm before using the drug in clinical situations </plain></SENT>
