<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The paper evaluates the efficiency and safety of the developed osmotherapy protocol using controlled continuous infusion of 15% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and nine patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) syndrome of various etiologies had 15% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusion, the rate of which was determined by clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infusion rate was 50 ml/hr with midline brain structure dislocation of 8 mm or more and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of consciousness (a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS) score of less than 8) and 25 ml/hr with brain dislocation of 7-mm or less and a GCS score of 8 or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monitoring program was as follows: Block 1 comprised the clinical and instrumental data characterizing the adequacy of brain perfusion (GCS, the magnitude of focal neurological symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, mean blood pressure, computed tomographic dislocation); Block 2 involved the clinical and laboratory data identifying the extracerebral complications of osmotherapy (packed cell volume, plasma osmolarity, urine density, and renal ultrasonography); Block 3 consisted of cerebral oximetry (CO) and Neurotrend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors' early proposed integral indicators of OC, such as interhemispheric asymmetry coefficient and hemodynamic conformity index, were used to estimate the adequacy of brain perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, a Neurotrend microsensor was implanted at 3-cm depth for the direct quantitative determination of pO2, pCO2, pH, and brain temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was characterized by natural changes in the CO indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vasospasm, the mean linear blood flow velocity was 245 +/- 14 cm/sec in the basilar arteries, which was attended by low pO2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, as shown by readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optimization of artificial ventilation, stabilization of hemodynamics, and the use of postural exposures and osmo <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> normalization and central perfusion pressure optimization, which was accompanied by the disappearance of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, as suggested by Neurotrend reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusion averaged 6.6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No urinary tract complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proposed procedure of osmotherapy is effective and safe if the scope of monitoring is adequate </plain></SENT>
