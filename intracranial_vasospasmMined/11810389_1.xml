<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Selective intraarterial infusion of papaverine is used in the treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delays in instituting therapy for vasospasm can lead to irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and a devastating outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular papaverine treatment of vasospasm in the presence of low-attenuation lesions on computed tomography (CT) is controversial, because of the fear of reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in completed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Two patients with aneurysmal SAH who subsequently developed severe diffuse vasospasm were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both patients, large areas of low-attenuation change suggesting impending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were seen on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients received multiple infusions of intraarterial papaverine in an effort to treat vasospasm refractory to medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: After multiple intermittent administrations of papaverine, which initially appeared to increase the low-attenuation changes, there was dramatic reversal of the radiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also improvement in circulation time, transcranial Doppler velocities, and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that in some patients, intraarterial infusions of papaverine initiated in the earliest stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may exacerbate the radiographic appearance of low-attenuation changes, but may ultimately reverse the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
