<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission 69% of cases had a good Hunt and Hess scale (grades I to II) and 31% a poor grade (grades III to V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was determined by Fisher's grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (25%) patients were classified in grades I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of cases had pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early surgery (within the first three days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) was performed in 17% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurred in six (9.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was diagnosed in 14 (22%) cases, but only 8 (12%) had evidence of low density on the computerized tomographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> developed in 16 (25%) cases and 10 needed ventriculoperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcome was determined using the activity of daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of the patients made a good recovery and 13.8% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significant poor prognostic factors included a poor pre-operative grade of the Hunt and Hess scale, the presence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and the Fisher's SAH grade of greater than II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other factors which apparently were not related to the outcome included age, sex, timing of surgery, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intraoperative rupture, and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
