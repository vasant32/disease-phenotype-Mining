<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the possible prophylactic potential of fasudil, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, on the development of endothelial injury and neutrophil infiltration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the two haemorrhage canine model, fasudil (3 mg/kg) was infused intravenously for 30 min twice daily (days 1-7) and related histological changes were observed by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 7 characteristic features of the basilar arteries included corrugation of the elastic lamina and endothelial disruption; fasudil inhibited this endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked neutrophil infiltration into the subarachnoid space was not detected until day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 7 a large number of neutrophils was observed in the subarachnoid space around <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the basilar arteries examined; fasudil treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that: (1) endothelial injury and neutrophils play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; and (2) fasudil inhibited both endothelial damage and neutrophil infiltration, and therefore protein kinase pathways may have a role in these pathological events </plain></SENT>
