<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 10 patients (age 52-73) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were 10-50mm in size (mean: 21mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the causes and frequency of ischemic complications by analyzing postoperative magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative diffusion-imaging confirmed ischemic complications in six of the 10 patients (in two of the five ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and in four of the five unruptured) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ischemic complications that observed were infarction of the lenticulostriate artery territory in three cases, cortical infarction in two cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> that was likely to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, both cortical infarction and infarction of the lenticulostriate artery territory were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at the time of discharge indicated good recovery (GR) and moderate disability (MD) in seven cases, severe disability (SD) in two cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (D) in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests the possibility that STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastamosis in surgeries for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be performed with comparatively better safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the temporary occlusion time with this surgery is longer than that with a temporary clipping for aneurysmal surgery; thus, we believe that adequate countermeasures are required to prevent ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
