<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we adopted the confocal laser microscopy to detect the fluorescence signals arising from the individual smooth muscle cells of canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ring preparations were made, loaded with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5107">fluo-3</z:chebi> and changes in fluorescence induced by high K+ and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured by confocal laser microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some unstimulated smooth muscle cells <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves arising from discrete region of the cell propagated to the whole cell with a velocity of approximately 10 microm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High K+ (80 mmol/L) induced a rapid rise in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, the peak level being consistently reached approximately 10 s after stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the time to peak level of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by ET-1 (0.3 micromol/L) varied widely between 13 and 26 s among individual cells, an indication that the extent of nonuniform coordination of increases in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in individual cells may be partly responsible for the different time courses of tension development of vascular smooth muscle in response to the vasoactive stimulants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by ET-1 was transient but a pronounced and sustained contraction developed further in response to ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus ET-1 has a biological property as a potential candidate to elicit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser microscopy could be a useful tool to measure the changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in individual smooth muscle cells of cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
