<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid short- and long-term effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and as there is no single or optimal treatment modality employed, we have instituted a protocol for the prevention and treatment of vasospasm in patients suffering aneurysmal sub-arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then reviewed the effectiveness of this protocol in reducing the mortality and morbidity rate in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we present a retrospective analysis of 52 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between March 2004 and December 2008 52 patients were admitted to our service with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients commenced nimodipine, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> (MgSO(4)) and triple H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with significant reduction in conscious level were intubated, ventilated and sedated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was used for intubated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was induced for patients with refractory high ICP; angiography was performed for diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Balloon angioplasty was performed if considered necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using this protocol, only 13 patients (25%) developed clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten of them were given <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four out of 52 patients (7.7%) died from severe vasospasm, 3 patients (5.8%) became severely disabled, and 39 patients (75%) were discharged in a condition considered as either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near to their pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the aforementioned protocol for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is effective and can be used safely </plain></SENT>
