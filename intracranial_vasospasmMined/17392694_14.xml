<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a sustained constriction of the cerebral arteries that can be reduced by endothelin (ET) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> such as nimodipine are relatively less effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 is not increased enough after SAH to directly cause the constriction, so we sought alternate mechanisms by which ET-1 might mediate vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was created in dogs, and the smooth muscle cells were studied molecularly, electrophysiologically, and by isometric tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During vasospasm, ET-1, 10 nmol/L, induced a nonselective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> current carried by Ca(2+) in 64% of cells compared with in only 7% of control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (a specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of store-operated channels) had no effect, whereas SKF96365 (a nonspecific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of nonselective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels) decreased this current in vasospastic smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins may mediate entry of Ca(2+) through nonselective cationic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We tested their role by incubating smooth muscle cells with anti-TRPC1 or TRPC4, both of which blocked ET-1-induced currents in SAH cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-TRPC5 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-TRPC1 also inhibited ET-1 contraction of SAH arteries in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of seven TRPC isoforms found increased expression of TRPC4 and a novel splice variant of TRPC1 and increased protein expression of TRPC4 and TRPC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results support a novel mechanism whereby ET-1 significantly increases Ca(2+) influx mediated by TRPC1 and TRPC4 or their heteromers in smooth muscle cells, which promotes development of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
