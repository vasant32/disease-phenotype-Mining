<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify additional risk factors for symptomatic vasospasm, the authors performed a prospective analysis of 75 consecutively admitted patients who were treated for aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients who died before treatment or were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> postoperatively were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 70 patients, demographic (age, gender, and race) and clinical (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, illicit drug use, sentinel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade, and ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location) parameters were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression to determine factors independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with hypervolemic therapy and administration of nimodipine as prophylaxis for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was suspected in cases that exhibited (by elevation of transcranial Doppler velocities) neurological deterioration 3 to 14 days after SAH with no other explanation and was confirmed either by clinical improvement in response to induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three percent of the patients were women, 74% were white, 64% were cigarette smokers, and 46% were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of the patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, 19% from sentinel bleed, and 49% had a Fisher Grade 3 SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine percent of the patients developed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that cigarette smoking (p = 0.033; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-8.9) and Fisher Grade 3, that is, thick subarachnoid clot (p = 0.008; odds ratio 5.1, 95% CI 2-13.1), were independent predictors of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors make the novel observation that cigarette smoking increases the risk of symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH, independent of Fisher grade </plain></SENT>
