<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of clazosentan, a new selective endothelin receptor subtype A <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on cerebral perfusion and cerebral oxygenation following severe aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients treated at our institution in the context of a phase IIa, multicenter, randomized trial on clazosentan's safety and efficacy in reducing the incidence of angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were included in this substudy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phase IIa study (n = 34) consisted of two parts: a double-blind, randomized Part A (clazosentan 0.2 mg/kg/h versus placebo) and an open-label Part B (clazosentan 0.4 mg/kg/h for 12 h followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h) for patients with established vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel to the phase IIa study protocol, which included assessment of vasospasm by angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography, we determined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebrovascular resistance, and regional tissue oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral perfusion was comparable between treatment groups during the early post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> period (rCBF placebo, 22.6 +/- 3.5 ml/100 g/min versus rCBF clazosentan, 23.9 +/- 1.1 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the time of control angiography (day 8 after aSAH), rCBF decreased by 50% in the placebo group (11.3 +/- 6.7 ml/ 100 g/min) while it remained stable in the clazosentan group (23.5 +/- 12.9 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During Part B of the study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients who developed haemodynamically relevant vasospasm during placebo treatment, showed a sustained improvement in rCBF upon conversion to clazosentan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that clazosentan reduces the extent of vasospasm-associated impairment of cerebral perfusion following aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clazosentan may exert beneficial actions on overt vasospasm-associated hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
