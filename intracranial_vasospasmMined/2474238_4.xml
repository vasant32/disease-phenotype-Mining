<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> of various sizes, the present study was undertaken to determine if the barrier disruption shortly after SAH occurs equally to various sized tracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four groups were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> of differing molecular weights (MW): FD4 (MW = 4,080), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 40 (MW = 40,500), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 70 (MW = 71,400), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 150 (MW = 156,900) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group was injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP: MW = 40,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each group was further divided into two subgroups: with or without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the integrity of the blood-arterial wall barrier by transmission electron microscope, the tracers were intravenously injected prior to sacrificing the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The groups without SAH showed no permeability of tracers into the subendothelial spaces of the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with the exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 150, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 40, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> 70) were noticed in the subendothelial spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi> in the elastic lamina was similar to that of HRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that barrier disruption occurs with a wide range of molecular sizes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextrans</z:chebi>, although there seems to be some limitation to the permeation of the larger molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the mechanism of barrier disruption of the major cerebral arteries in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage following SAH may be vesicular rather than by separation of tight junctions </plain></SENT>
