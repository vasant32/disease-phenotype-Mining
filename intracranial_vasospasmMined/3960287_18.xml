<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each of 21 adult mongrel dogs (15 to 20 kg) was assigned to one of four experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received a total of 15 ml of fresh, unheparinized arterial blood via three cisterna magna injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective left vertebral arteriography was performed 1 week before and exactly 7 days after the simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> was initiated at 24 hours and continued for 7 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were based on the percentage of reduction in basilar artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On a milligram/kilogram basis, we used the manufacturer's maximal recommended daily dosages of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, whereas the dosages of nimodipine used were 3 to 7 times greater than that reported to be therapeutically effective in reducing the incidence of severe deficits from vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this laboratory trial, systemic treatment with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> did not prevent or significantly reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, spasm reduced basilar artery diameter an average of 71% +/- 11 (SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, 10 mg orally every 6 hours, vessel diameter was reduced an average of 58% +/- 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In those animals treated with nimodipine, 20 or 40 mg orally every 4 hours, the basilar artery diameter was decreased an average of 59% +/- 8 and 56% +/- 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A preliminary trial using direct intracisternal administration of these agents demonstrated increased vessel diameter within 20 minutes in four of six animals, supporting other reports that this route of administration may prove more efficacious in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
