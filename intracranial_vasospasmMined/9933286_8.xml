<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tirilazad mesylate has been used in the attempt to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), although the actual targets of this agent in vivo have thus far been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescence/high-performance liquid chromatography provided a new method for direct measurements of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (PCOOH) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (PEOOH) in vivo and showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> is the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> class most susceptible to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we measured those levels in a primate model of SAH for determination of the effects of tirilazad on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen Macaca monkeys of both sexes were randomly assigned into 2 groups: a tirilazad group receiving a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg and a placebo group receiving only the vehicle in which tirilazad was delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the induction of experimental SAH around the right middle cerebral artery on day 0, tirilazad or vehicle was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 7, the animals were killed after angiography and regional cerebral blood flow measurements were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of PCOOH and PEOOH were measured in the clots, bilateral parietal cortices, right frontal cortex contact with clots, cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral middle cerebral arteries, and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the placebo group, a significant vasospasm occurred in the cerebral arteries on both sides, but most prominently on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm in the cerebral arteries was significantly attenuated in the tirilazad group (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in regional cerebral blood flow, PCOOH, and PEOOH levels in the clots, cerebral cortices, and cerebellar hemispheres between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the levels of PCOOH in the cerebral arteries were significantly higher in the placebo group than in the tirilazad group (P&lt;0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was remarkable that the tirilazad treatments eliminated PCOOH in any vascular territory after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PCOOH in the artery wall may be an important indicator for vasospasm, and the inhibition of PCOOH may explain the efficacy of tirilazad on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
