<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Though <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has been recognized for over half a century, it remains a major complication in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with SAH, suggesting that ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction contributes to vascular constriction after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> promotes vasodilation in humans and in experimental animals, in part by decreasing the production of ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) on the production of ET-1 and cerebrovasospasm in an experimental SAH 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 30-mm Silastic tube filled with E2 in corn oil (0.3 mg/ml) was subcutaneously implanted in male rats just before SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm was determined by averaging the cross-sectional areas of basilar artery 7 days after first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples collected before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were assayed for ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of E2 in attenuating vasospasm achieved statistical significance when compared with the SAH only or SAH plus vehicle groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of ET-1 were higher in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups than in controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of ET-1 in the SAH plus E2 and E2 only groups were significantly lower than those in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between ET-1 levels in the healthy control and SAH plus E2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the cross-sectional areas of basilar artery and ET-1 levels (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of E2 in attenuating SAH-induced vasospasm may be due in part to decreasing ET-1 production after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The role of E2 in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH is promising and is worthy of further investigation </plain></SENT>
