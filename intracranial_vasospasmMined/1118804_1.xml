<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Topical application of phenoxybenzamine prevented the occurence of vasospasm without noticeable systemic alpha adrenergic blocking effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous use, however, was ineffective in the dosage with which total systemic alpha adrenergic blockade was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of intravenous administration in much larger dosage seemed to be largely due to the non-specific action of phenoxybenzamine on vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
