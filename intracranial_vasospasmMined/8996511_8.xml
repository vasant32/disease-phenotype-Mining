<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the newborn pig, opioids contribute to pial artery vasconstriction after fluid percussion injury (FPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FPI attenuates vasodilation and cGMP production by methionine enkephalin (Met) and leucine enkephalin (Leu) and reverse dynorphin (Dyn) from a dilator to a constrictor </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a purported mediator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, has been suggested to alter nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> function and cGMP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine the contribution of ET-1 to altered opioid-induced dilation after FPI and the role of <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> in such altered responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Injury of moderate severity (1.9 to 2.3 atm) was produced by the lateral FPI technique in anesthetized newborn pigs equipped with a closed cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>) reduction was determined as an index of <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FPI increased cerebrospinal fluid ET-1 from 20 +/- 2 to 93 +/- 6 pg/mL (approximately 10(-10) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Topical ET-1 (10(-10) mol/L) increased SOD-inhibitable <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction from 1 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 3 pmol/mm2, similar to previously reported <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction after FPI (14 +/- 2 pmol/mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BQ123 (10(-6) mol/L), an ET-1 antagonist, blunted the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction observed after FPI (4 +/- 1 pmol/mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Met produced pial vasodilation that was attenuated by FPI and partially restored by BQ123 pretreatment (7 +/- 1%, 11 +/- 1%, and 17 +/- 1% versus 3 +/- 1%, 6 +/- 1%, and 9 +/- 2% versus 5 +/- 1%, 9 +/- 1%, and 14 +/- 2% for 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) mol/L Met during control conditions, after FPI, and after FPI pretreated with BQ123, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Met-induced dilation was associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid cGMP, and these biochemical changes were likewise blunted by FPI and partially restored by BQ123 (357 +/- 12, 455 +/- 15, 500 +/- 19, and 632 +/- 11 versus 264 +/- 4, 267 +/- 4, 295 +/- 12, and 305 +/- 15 versus 309 +/- 19, 432 +/- 11, 529 +/- 10, and 593 +/- 4 pg/mL for resting conditions, 10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) mol/L Met during control conditions, after FPI, and after FPI pretreated with BQ123, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar partial restoration of vascular and biochemical parameters was observed for Leu and Dyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ET-1, in concentrations similar to that present in cerebrospinal fluid after FPI, increases <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data also indicate the opioid-induced vasodilation and cGMP production are partially restored after FPI by ET-1 receptor blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ET-1 contributes to altered cerebral hemodynamics after FPI, at least in part, through elevated <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
