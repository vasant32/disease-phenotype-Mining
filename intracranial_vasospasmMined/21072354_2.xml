<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CV is frequently associated with poorer outcomes in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between the ictus of SAH and its CV complication, there is a 3-7 days delay, which provides a time window to predict and possibly prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the precise pathomechanism of CV is still unclear and approaches for predicting it are inefficient, more effective ways of predicting CV need to be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a protective nourishing fluid flows through the subarachnoid space, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) closely relates to the health states of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of CSF can provide invaluable information to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> because of its relatively direct representation of events in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assume that the components in CSF and their alterations may reflect the state of aneurismal SAH and the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, three types of CSF from healthy control, and patients who suffered SAH and its complication, CV, were investigated via two-dimensional separations in combination with elemental and molecular mass spectrometry detection for the identification of elemental species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was initially used with selective metal detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) for characterizing size distribution of metal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Various molecular distribution patterns were exhibited at different metal detection points (Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further identification of possible metallopeptides and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35134">metalloprotein</z:chebi> in tryptic digested fractions from the three sample types were made via reverse phase (RP)-Chip and electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with the Spectrum Mill data base search engine accessing appropriate data bases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were generated to show suggested protein similarities or differences across the three CSF sample types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six protein families with possible protein markers were further identified, and may be considered as possible focus areas for discovering valuable biomarkers to preclude the debilitating or deadly vasospasm </plain></SENT>
