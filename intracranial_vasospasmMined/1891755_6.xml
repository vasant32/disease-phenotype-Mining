<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (E)-3-[p-(1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16069">imidazol</z:chebi>-1-ylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>]-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37080">propenoate</z:chebi>] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient (8%) developed permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (8%) died of the side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> could lead an independent life after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> late during the administration of the drug </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one of our patients </plain></SENT>
