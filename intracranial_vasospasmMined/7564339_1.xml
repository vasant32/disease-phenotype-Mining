<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the responses to intraluminally applied <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries by the stainless-steel cannula-inserting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In control vessels with intact endothelium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> produced a slight vasodilatation followed by a long-lasting vasoconstriction in the absence of induced tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">Propranolol</z:chebi>, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, had no effect on the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After endothelial removal with intraluminal saponin, the constrictor component of the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> was significantly enhanced, and the constrictions to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>) were significantly potentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exposure to extraluminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced constriction was significantly augmented, whereas the dilator component of the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 was significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enhanced constriction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> after endothelial removal was significantly blocked by OKY-046 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor) and nimodipine (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), but was slightly though not significantly suppressed by AA-861 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response to PGF2 alpha was not altered by OKY-046 or AA-861 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the potentiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced constriction after endothelial removal may be mediated in part by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>), linked with extracellular calcium entry in smooth muscle cells (SMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mechanism might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
