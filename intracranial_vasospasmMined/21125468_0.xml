<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: we reviewed 90 cases treated with intra-arterial administration of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> between August 1998 and April 2009 and investigated the clinical efficacy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: angiographic improvement of vasospasm was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight had ischemic lesion on CT at discharge in Group A, which included 39 patients who presented angiographic and symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 4 (50%) of these eight were recovered with a condition of GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients showed ischemic lesion on CT in Group B, which included 51 patients who presented angiographic vasospasm without symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two (3.3%) of 59 patients who presented angiographic vasospasm without symptoms at the initial follow-up angiography had ischemic lesion on CT at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-year follow-up showed 78.9% of GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient showed any adverse effects resulting from intra-arterial administration of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: intra-arterial administration of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was an effective and safe management technique for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
