<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were treated with intraarterial papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cases were nineteen, and asymptomatic cases were twelve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Papaverine (120 mg/saline 50 ml, 30 min) was injected superselectively to vasospastic vessels through a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of symptomatically improved cases was 63% initially, but about two thirds of those cases had recurrence within a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 63% of symptomatic cases showed infarction in spite of papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases of recurrent vasospasm after intra-arterial papaverine underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and showed good <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of vasospastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complications of our intra-arterial papaverine were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in two cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> in one case and transient disturbed consciousness in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We experienced no fatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall outcome was ADL1 (19%), ADL2 (25%), ADL3 (44%), ADL4 (0%), ADL5 (6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the effect of intra-arterial papaverine infusion is of short duration and weak, combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and papaverine may be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is recommended to use papaverine for vasospasm in distal arteries such as M2, A1, A2, and to carry out <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for proximal arteries such as ICA and M1 </plain></SENT>
