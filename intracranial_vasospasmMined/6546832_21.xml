<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nimodipine (BAY e 9736) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e>, intraventricular pressure and blood pressure (BP), when administered into the cerebral ventricles of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was produced by the injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a group of 8 dogs, 100 micrograms of nimodipine was injected into the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the drug on the basilar artery was monitored angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine always relieved spasm, and often the relaxation surpassed the resting vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a control group, the injection of placebo did not relax the spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Determinations using gas chromatography of nimodipine in CSF and blood demonstrated that a concentration of 1 microgram/ml in cisternal CSF was sufficient to reduce spasm while concomitant plasma concentrations of 0.004 micrograms/ml did not result in significant BP reduction </plain></SENT>
