<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary angioplasty has been introduced for the treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data regarding the therapeutic benefit of angioplasty in improving patient outcomes are limited, hence its utilization at hospitals remains controversial and currently is not reimbursed by Medicare or major insurance companies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>), a nationally representative dataset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> admissions in the United States from 2005 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the prevalence of angioplasty procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at the national level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality, discharge status, length of stay, and cost of hospitalization were compared between hospitals performing angioplasty with those not performing angioplasty in multivariable model, adjusted for patient's age, utilization of endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration, and disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 74,356 estimated patients with nontraumatic SAH, 47% (n = 35,172) were admitted to hospitals that perform angioplasty for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and only 1307 patients (3.8%) were treated with angioplasty for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, we found that patients admitted to hospitals performing angioplasty had higher rates of discharge to home without supervision (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in in-hospital mortality, length of stay, or cost of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the odds of a patient being discharged to home are better at hospitals performing angioplasty for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Provision of angioplasty may be used as a surrogate marker of model of care in management of patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
