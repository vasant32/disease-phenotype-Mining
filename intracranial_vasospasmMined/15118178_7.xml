<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Critical closing pressure (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>) is thought to be jointly influenced by intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> is affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 15 patients with vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> was calculated using 2 methods previously reported (ad modem Aaslid and Michel, indexed <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Aaslid) and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Michel), respectively) based on data of arterial blood pressure and flow velocity (FV) as assessed by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) during vasospasm (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Aaslid)=6.3+/-22.9 mm Hg, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Michel)=14.9+/-16.5 mm Hg, mean+/-SD) as compared with baseline (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Aaslid)=24.4+/-20.3 mm Hg, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Michel)=27.8+/-19.4 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was not attributable to ICP, which remained unaffected by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> was significantly lower on the side of vasospasm (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Aaslid)=11.9+/-24.2 mm Hg, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Michel)=18.4+/-19.6 mm Hg) as compared with the contralateral nonvasospastic side (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Aaslid)=24.7+/-22.3 mm Hg, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>(Michel)=28.2+/-18.0 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that autoregulation-related distal vasodilatation outweighs proximal vasospasm, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> should decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> might have increased during vasospasm as the tension of big vessels increase, but the turbulence occurring during vasospasm may have impaired the linear relationship between pressure and FV, thus leading to a marked underestimation of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, interpretation of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> in vasospasm is difficult and may be overshadowed by nonlinear hemodynamic effects </plain></SENT>
