<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 dogs were studied in this experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Placebo (six animals), rtPA (six animals), antisense preproET-1 oligodeoxynucleotide (ASOD; five animals), or rtPA plus ASOD (combined treatment; six animals) was injected into the cisterna magna 30 minutes after a second SAH was induced on the 2nd day of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were observed until Day 7, when they underwent follow-up angiography and then were killed; their basilar arteries were removed for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals included in this study (two animals in each group) received placebo, rtPA, ASOD, or rtPA plus ASOD without induction of SAH, or rtPA with mismatched (nonsense) preproET-1 oligodeoxynucleotide following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six additional dogs were analyzed earlier following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dogs that received placebo developed severe vasospasm (51+/-8% of baseline caliber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of ASOD alone resulted in a mild reduction in vasospasm (64+/-13% of baseline caliber) and rtPA alone resulted in a moderate reduction in vasospasm (81+/-5% of baseline caliber); however, the combined therapy of rtPA plus ASOD almost completely prevented vasospasm (95+/-6%, of baseline caliber), which was significantly different from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis of the basilar arteries yielded results similar to angiography with respect to vasospasm severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ASOD treatment combined with rtPA resulted in reduced ET-1 expression, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining of the arteries, and reduced preproET-1 levels on Day 4, as measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonsense DNA sequences had no effect on the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antisense preproET-1 oligodeoxynucleotide treatment, when combined with clot lysis caused by rtPA, reduced vasospasm in the canine model of SAH, and this effect appeared to be related to reduced ET-1 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this experiment support a causative role for ET-1 early in the course of vasospasm development in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The apparent additive therapeutic effects of antisense and fibrinolytic treatments could be due to clot lysis, which allows better delivery of oligodeoxynucleotides to arteries within the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
