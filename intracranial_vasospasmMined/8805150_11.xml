<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who are hospitalized because of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work has suggested that activation of the complement cascade contributes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further examine this hypothesis, a rabbit model of SAH was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two milliliters of autologous arterial blood was injected into the region of the perimesencephalic cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after SAH was induced, intravital perfusion-fixation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of the basilar artery was used to assess the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after pretreatment with the complement depleting agent, cobra venom factor (CVF), or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were randomized to one of four groups: 1) sham (n = 5); 2) sham + CVF (n = 4); 3) SAH (n = 10); or 4) SAH + CVF (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours before induction of SAH, the animals received either 100 units/kg CVF or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total hemolytic potential of the serum confirmed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in serum complement activity 24 hours after the administration of CVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with CVF significantly (P &lt; 0.0083) reduced the extent of vasospasm, as assessed by lumen diameter from 393.9 +/- 100.1 microns (mean +/- standard deviation) in the SAH group to 510.7 +/- 72.8 microns in the SAH + CVF group, when compared with the sham (594.5 +/- 27.9 microns) and sham + CVF (587.7 +/- 47.3 microns) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest a role for complement activation in SAH </plain></SENT>
