<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> adversely impacts the outcome of those suffering aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prediction of vasospasm could improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that preclinical vasospasm would be heralded by an increase in cerebral oxygen extractions (AVDO2) which could be detected by jugular bulb oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pilot study was conducted to address this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen consenting patients with aneurysmal SAH, undergoing early surgery, were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were withdrawn from the study secondary to failure of catheters or religious belief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of craniotomy, a jugular bulb catheter was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, arterial and jugular bulb blood samples were taken every 12 hours to calculate AVDO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As this was an observational study, no change in management occurred based on measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four of 10 patients had clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients had a significant rise in AVDO2 approximately one day prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurologic deficits (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms resolved along with a significant improvement in AVDO2 on instituting hypertensive, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="24480">hemo</z:chebi>-dilutional, and hypervolemic therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The six patients who did not exhibit clinical vasospasm did not demonstrate significant rise in AVDO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Jugular bulb oximetry is simple and cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increases in AVDO2 using this technique were predictive of clinically evident vasospasm in the subsequent hours to days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This investigation supports a larger study to assess the utility of jugular bulb oximetry in predicting vasospasm in aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
