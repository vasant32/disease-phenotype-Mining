<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on accumulating evidence of the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase (XO) in generating oxygen free radicals and causing tissue damage during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we examined the possible role of XO in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After inducing SAH in dogs by two autologous blood injections 2 days apart, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm of the basilar artery was reliably produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a 3.5-fold elevation in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA), the product of XO, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parenteral administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> (i.v., 25 mg/kg, every 6 hours), a specific blocker of XO, successfully abolished the elevation in CSF <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels due to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, angiographic vasospasm measured on Day 7, morphological changes observed by electron microscope, and elevated CSF <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> levels were not altered by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that the observed activation of the enzyme XO, which is a well-known source of oxygen free radicals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in various organs, is not playing a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this animal </plain></SENT>
