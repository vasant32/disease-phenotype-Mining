<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the vasoconstrictive effects of TNC and its mechanisms of action on cerebral arteries in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two dosages (1 and 10Î¼g) of TNC were administered intracisternally to healthy rats, and the effects were evaluated by neurobehavioral tests and India-ink angiography at 24, 48, and 72hours after the administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms on constricted cerebral arteries after 24hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (LPS-RS), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 inhibitors (SP600125 and SB203580) on TNC-induced vasoconstriction were evaluated at 24hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher dosages of TNC induced more severe cerebral arterial constriction, which continued for more than 72hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNC administration also upregulated TLR4, and activated JNK and p38 in the smooth muscle cell layer of the constricted cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LPS-RS blocked TNC-induced TLR4 upregulation, JNK and p38 activation, and vasoconstrictive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SP600125 and SB203580 abolished TNC-induced TLR4 upregulation and vasoconstrictive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNC may cause prolonged cerebral arterial constriction via TLR4 and activation of JNK and p38, which may upregulate TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that TNC causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and provides a novel therapeutic approach against it </plain></SENT>
