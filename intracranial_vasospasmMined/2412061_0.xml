<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain window was connected to a thermostat-regulated pool of Elliot's solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By air-drying (10 min) of the arachnoid mesothelium access for drugs, applied into the pool, was established to the adventitia of the leptomeningeal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) (10(-6)-10(-4) M) caused dose-dependent contractile responses (morphometry of outer vessel diameter) of both arteries and veins of three different sizes (large, 200-300 microns; medium, 50-150 microns; small, 30-50 microns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A well-reproducible contractile response was obtained at challenge with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (10(-4) M) from the various vascular beds with most pronounced effects on the arterial side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the animals were pretreated with peripheral blockade of serotonergic (5-HT2) receptors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> 0.3 mg/kg i.v.), challenge with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (10(-4) M) elicited no significant vascular responses on either the arterial or venous sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vital microscopy further visualized capillary beds after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> pretreatment that were not seen under control conditions </plain></SENT>
