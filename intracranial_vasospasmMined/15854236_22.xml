<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since October 1999, nicardipine prolonged-release implants (NPRIs) have been used to prevent vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to examine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and outcome after the application of NPRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients among 125 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who were surgically treated within 72 hours were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPRIs were applied principally to patients with thick clots (Fisher Group 3) through a frontotemporal or frontal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients, including five in Fisher Group 2, were treated with NPRIs, and 28 were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NPRIs were placed in the cisterns of thick clots where vasospasm was highly probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four (6%) of the 69 patients treated with NPRIs and 3 (11%) of the 28 patients not treated with NPRIs developed delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, clinical deterioration with infarction occurred in two patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current smoking (P = 0.0088) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> on admission computed tomographic (CT) scans (P = 0.0077) were correlated with DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT groupings on admission and postoperatively were not correlated, nor were World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was inversely correlated with DIND (P = 0.0233) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients (89%) had an independent status at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age (odds ratio [OR], 6.836; P = 0.034), World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade (OR, 23.317; P = 0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> on admission CT scans (OR, 6.332; P = 0.024), and surgical complications (OR, 32.861; P = 0.003) were independent risk factors influencing an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CT grouping on admission and DIND were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the incidence of DIND may decrease and, therefore, an unfavorable outcome may improve if NPRIs are applied for patients with thick clots (Fisher Group 3) during surgery </plain></SENT>
