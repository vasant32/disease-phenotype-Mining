<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to assess the efficacy of intra-arterial nimodipine, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium-channel blocker</z:chebi> acting mainly on cerebral vessels, in preventing delayed neurologic deficits in patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical charts of 25 consecutively treated patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multifactorial decision tree was used to determine the indication for angiography and subsequent endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine was infused intra-arterially via a diagnostic catheter in the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery at a rate of 0.1 mg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm before endovascular treatment, immediate vessel caliber modifications, and short- and long-term clinical efficacy of the procedure were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty procedures were performed in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was observed in 19 (76%), 16 of whom improved after the first endovascular procedure, two after the second intra-arterial treatment, and one after the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 19 patients, only 12 (63%) had notable vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at postprocedural angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of infused vessels occurred in only 13 (43%) of 30 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After follow-up of 3-6 months, 18 (72%) of 25 patients had a favorable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score of 1-2 and modified Rankin scale score of 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial nimodipine is effective and safe for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further prospective randomized studies of cerebral blood flow are needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
