<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of intra-arterial infusion (IAF) of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> for symptomatic vasospasm in terms of neurological improvement and the angiographic features of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 23 patients underwent IAF therapy for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm was assessed before and after the IAF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate clinical effect was assessed within 24 hours after the IAF treatment, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to evaluate late clinical outcome at 3 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IAF treatment was performed on 34 occasions for 23 patients (16 women, 7 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic improvement was observed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occasions (100%), and immediate clinical improvement was observed on 15 occasions (44.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3-month follow-up, 15 patients (65.2%) showed good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IAF therapy was effective in dilating spastic arteries, and clinical improvement was observed in approximately half of the fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that the IAF therapy was safe and effective for patients with symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
