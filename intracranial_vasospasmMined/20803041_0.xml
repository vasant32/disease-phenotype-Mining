<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many agents are experimentally and clinicaly used to protect or recover from vasospasm, an effective neurotherapeutic drug is still missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (EPO) is recently a promising candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the dose-dependent effects of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) on arterial wall in a rat femoral artery vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty two animals were divided into four groups: vasospasm without any treatment (group A), vasospasm +250 IU/kg rhEPO group (group B), vasospasm +500 IU/kg rhEPO group (group C), and control group (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rat femoral artery vasospasm model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For groups B and C, 7 days of 250 IU/kg and 500 IU/kg intraperitoneal rhEPO in 0.3 ml saline were administered respectively; and for groups A and D, 0.3 ml saline were administered intraperitoneally without any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, histological and morphometric analyses were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vasospasm alone group demonstrated the highest vessel wall thicknesses, comparing to other groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While for groups B and C, vessel wall thickness values were significantly higher than the control group (p &lt; 0.001), between these two groups, there was no significant difference achieved (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, there was no significant difference between the two rhEPO treatment groups, but rhEPO treatment was shown to be histologically and morphometrically effective in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, if dosage of EPO treatment is augmented, successful results may be achieved </plain></SENT>
