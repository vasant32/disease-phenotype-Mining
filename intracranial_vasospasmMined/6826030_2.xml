<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> was induced by repeated injections of autologous blood in a total amount of 14-33 ml into the basal cisterns of baboons to mimick <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), sagittal sinus pressure, cerebral arterial caliber from angiograms, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and after the experimental SAH to determine responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, Nimodipine, on CBF autoregulation pre- and post-SAH was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week after the blood injections were started there was about 10-20% reduction, depending on territory measured, in the arterial diameter of the carotid and vertebral systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an 18% reduction in CBF and 9% decrease in the brain metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> before and after experimental SAH the flow increased with a mean of 3.7 and 1.8 ml, respectively, for each mm Hg elevation of PaCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control animals, graded angiotensin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> did not overtly affect CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following SAH, the CBF autoregulation was impaired in 5 of 6 animals tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>I.v. infusion of Nimodipine markedly curtailed the CBF autoregulation in pre-SAH animals and, to a somewhat slighter extent, also in post-SAH animals </plain></SENT>
