<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography findings, clinical examinations, and the vasospastic index of Lindegaard were analyzed for children who fulfilled the criteria for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The significance of the presence of vasospasm and abnormal hemodynamics were statistically analyzed using the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> approximation to the binomial test method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD sonography was performed using the standard published techniques for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two patients between the ages of 5 and 17 years who had undergone at least one TCD sonographic examination were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 113 TCD sonographic examinations were performed on the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated mean blood flow velocities were found in 23 of 62 patients (37%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early vasospasm was found in 4 of 62 patients (6.5%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bruits were noted in 35 of 62 patients (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the intermigrainous period in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to elaborate on the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular behavior during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may have a significant impact on the current clinical treatment of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
