<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This probably results from a balance between the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) and the endothelium-derived constricting factor(s) (e.g., endothelin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time course of the induction and the decay of these mutually antagonizing substances differ considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is probably involved in rapid changes in vascular tone whereas endothelin may be more important in long-term modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied the vasoconstrictor properties of endothelin in human cerebral artery strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelin typically produced an intense, sustained increae in tone over a dose range similar to that seen with other vasoconstrictor substances such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (ED50 = 10(-8) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response was resistant to selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of norephinephrine, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, acetycholine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond reducing agent (dithiothreitol) inhibited the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The physiological properties of this response are similar to those of a vasoconstrictor protein found in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time course of the induction of endothelin production is consistent with the temporal sequence of vasospasm, further supporting the hypothesis that endothelin may be involved in this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
