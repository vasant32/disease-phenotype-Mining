<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although several recent studies have suggested that the incidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is lower in patients undergoing aneurysmal coiling as compared with clipping, other studies have had conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience over 8 years and assessed whether clipping, craniotomy, or coiling affects patient outcomes or the risk for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 515 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, identified prospectively from November 2000 to February 2003 (243 patients) and retrospectively from November 1995 to October 2000 (272 patients), by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified patients as follows: clipping (413 patients), coiling (79 patients), and craniotomy (436 patients, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 413 patients who underwent clipping plus 23 who underwent coiling as well as craniotomy for various reasons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied four outcome measures: total vasospasm, symptomatic vasospasm, poor outcome (modified Rankin score 3-6), and in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk of total vasospasm and symptomatic vasospasm, we performed multivariate regression analyses adjusting for age, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location (anterior versus posterior circulation), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk for poor outcome and in-hospital mortality, we adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above variables as well as for total and symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the clipping group there was 63% total vasospasm and 28% symptomatic vasospasm; in the coiling group there was 54% total vasospasm and 33% symptomatic vasospasm; and in the craniotomy group there was 64% total vasospasm and 28% symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, age &lt;50 years (P = 0.0099) and Fisher Grade 3 (P &lt; 0.00001) predicted total vasospasm, and Fisher Grade 3 (P &lt; 0.000001) and Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V (P = 0.018) predicted symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictors of poor outcome were age &gt;or=50 years (P &lt; 0.0001), Fisher Grade 3 (P = 0.0072), Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V (P &lt; 0.00001), symptomatic vasospasm (P &lt; 0.0001), and coiling (P = 0.0314 versus clipping and P = 0.045 versus craniotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of in-hospital mortality were age &gt;or= 50 years (P = 0.0030), Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V (P = 0.0001), symptomatic vasospasm (P &lt; 0.00001), and coiling (P = 0.008 versus clipping and P = 0.0013 versus craniotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in total vasospasm or symptomatic vasospasm when patients who underwent clipping or craniotomy were compared with patients who underwent coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with Hunt and Hess Grade I to III ("good grade"), clipping and craniotomy were associated with better outcome and less in-hospital mortality, but there was no difference in total vasospasm or symptomatic vasospasm versus coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V ("poor grade"), there was no difference in any outcome measure among the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a single-center, retrospective, nonrandomized study, performance of clipping and/or craniotomy had significantly better outcome and lower mortality at discharge than coiling in good-grade patients but had no effect on total vasospasm or symptomatic vasospasm in good- or poor-grade patients </plain></SENT>
