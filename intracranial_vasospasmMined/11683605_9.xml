<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, the pharmacological approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> has been hampered in part by an inability to attain sufficiently high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome this limitation of current drug therapy, we have developed a sustained-release preparation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> Fasudil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rats was induced by double-injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated rats received 0.417 mg liposome-entrapped Fasudil via the cisterna magna and control rats received drug-free liposomes in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery was assessed at 7 days after the initial blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction of the rat basilar artery was significantly reduced in group treated with liposomal Fasudil compared to the control group (treated group: 87.7 +/- 6.18%, n= 10; control group: 66.3 +/- 9.82%, n = 10; ***P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This new approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may have significant potential for use in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
