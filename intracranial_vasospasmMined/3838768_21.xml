<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have examined whether calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> given sublingually, intravenously, or orally affect an experimentally induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed primarily to determine the efficacy of nimodipine given intracisternally in reversing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> produced in dogs by the injection of 4 ml of autogenous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the vasospasm and the vascular response to nimodipine were determined arteriographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of animals was studied acutely to determine the dose and pharmacodynamic effects of intrathecal nimodipine, a second group was studied 1 to 4 days after the intrathecal injection of blood, and a third group was studied 3 to 6 days after successive injections of cisternal blood given 48 hours apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some animals were studied further 24 hours after the nimodipine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal administration of 4 ml of 10(-3) M nimodipine promptly and completely reversed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect lasted at least 4 hours but had disappeared by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intrathecal administration of nimodipine produced a transient drop in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nimodipine given sublingually (0.28 to 0.58 mg/kg) or intravenously (0.1 mg/kg) produced a persistent hypotensive effect without affecting the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results show that the presence of nimodipine in the cerebrospinal fluid will reverse the blood-induced vasospasm, and suggest that this calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> administered intrathecally would be an effective emergency treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
