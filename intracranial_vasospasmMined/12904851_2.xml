<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Thirty male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Thirty rats were assessed for an initial neurologic status as double-blinded by two different neurosurgeons using a neurologic severity score (NSS) and then underwent an initial angiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two days later, 0.3 ml of homologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna to produce a SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NSS and angiographic examination were then repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats having no spasm or a spasm under 50% (n=8) and 50% or over 50% (n=22) were grouped separately, as groups 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rats having 50% or more spasm were further divided randomly into group 2A and 2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rats in groups 1 and 2A (n=11) underwent a 60-min course of 100% oxygen at the atmospheric pressure 1 atmosphere absolute (ata), and group 2B (n=11) received 100% oxygen at 3 ata for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic assessment was repeated on the next day and 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The animals having no spasm or less than 50% spasm had a better NSS and outcome when compared with the animals having 50% or more spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But the animals with 50% or more spasm which underwent hyperbaric therapy were shown to have a better outcome compared to the animals having hyperoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen therapy seemed to accelerate the recovery of neurologic deficits secondary to experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
