<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 55 adult male New-Zealand rabbits weighing 2.0-2.5 kg were randomly divided into 2 groups: control and SAH groups(including 10 subgroups at different sacrificed time: 12 h, 24 h, 2 d, 3 d, 4 d, 5 d, 6 d, 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>8 d, 9 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rabbits were induced into cisterna magna by withdraw of 0.5 mL cerebrospinal fluid followed with administration of 2 mL saline (control group) or fresh unheparinised autologous arterial blood (SAH group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurobehavioral scores were measured every day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The middle basilar artery and hippocampus were examined by optical microscope with HE stain, measuring coefficient of corrugation (CC) and survival number of hippocampal CA1 neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological injury was assessed by injured hippocampal CA1 neurons and neurobehavioral scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe and moderate vasospasms were detected in basilar arteries of the rabbits in the SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, the CC of the rabbits of the SAH group decreased significantly at 12 h, 24 h, 2 d, 3 d, and 4 d (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recovery on day 5 was temporary and the CC plunged again from day 6 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistical significance was found in the numbers of survived hippocampal CA1 neurons between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between hippocampal CA1 survival neurons and cerebrovasospasm progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vasospasm occur from 12 h to day 4, which is followed by delayed vasospasm from day 5 to day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal CA1, histopathological measurement is not suitable for evaluating brain injury after SAH </plain></SENT>
