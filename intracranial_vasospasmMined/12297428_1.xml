<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the expression of neuropeptide Y <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cerebral tissues of rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), to shed light on the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH rat models, saline and sham-operation control groups were respectively established, in which the relative abundance of neuropeptide Y <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the corpus striatum, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus were subsequently measured and compared by reverse transcriptase PCR at 15 min, 30 min and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h after corresponding treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The abundance of neuropeptide Y <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> significantly elevated in the cerebral tissues after SAH, and gradually declined with the passage of time, but were still significantly higher than that of saline and sham-operation controls at any of the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuropeptide Y <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in the cerebral tissues significantly elevates after SAH, which may play an important role in inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
