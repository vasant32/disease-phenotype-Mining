<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle cells show impaired relaxation after SAH, which may be caused by a defect in the ionic mechanisms regulating smooth muscle membrane potential and Ca(2+) permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by examining changes in expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein for ion channels in the basilar arteries of dogs after SAH using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was associated with a significant reduction in basilar artery diameter to 41 +/- 8% of pre-SAH diameter (P &lt; 0.001) after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was significant downregulation of the voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel K(v) 2.2 (65% reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001; 49% reduction in protein, P &lt; 0.05) and the beta1 subunit of the large-conductance, Ca(2+) - activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (BK) channel (53% reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in BK beta1 subunit protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of K(v) 2.2 and the BK-beta1 subunit correlated with the degree of vasospasm (r(2) = 0.490 and 0.529 respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ir)) channel K(ir) 2.1 was upregulated (234% increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.001; 350% increase in protein, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of L- type Ca(2+) channels and the BK-alpha subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
