<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 is vital for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to detect the expression of TLR4 in the basilar artery in a rabbit SAH model and to clarify the potential role of TLR4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals in day 3, day 5 and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the TLR4 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on day 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevated expression of TLR4 was detected after SAH and peaked on day 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLR4 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit experimental model of SAH </plain></SENT>
