<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 10(-6) M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> somewhat inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by A23187 in rings of canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 3 X 10(-6) M, it almost completely inhibited the same response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 X 10(-6) M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> did not significantly inhibit smooth muscle relaxation mechanisms as papaverine-induced relaxation was not inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also demonstrated that pretreatment of arterial rings with CSF-SAH resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of relaxation induced by A23187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of CSF-SAH was prominent in the case in which a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was measured by spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CSF from patients without SAH did not affect endothelium-dependent relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> released from lysed erythrocytes inhibits endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine basilar arteries and may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
