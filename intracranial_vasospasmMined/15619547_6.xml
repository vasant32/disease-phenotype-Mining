<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in the CSF of patients showing vasospasm were 42.4+/-37.1 pg/ml (mean+/-S.D., n=12) on Days 0-2, 66.4+/-41.0 pg/ml (n=14) on Days 3-5, 118.5+/-89.9 pg/ml (n=15) on Days 6-8, 86.2+/-70.2 pg/ml (n=11) on Days 9-11, 48.8+/-31.8 pg/ml (n=10) on Days 12-14, 27.8+/-20.1 pg/ml (n=7) after Day 20, while the concentrations in patients not showing vasospasm were 24.8+/-12.0 pg/ml (n=18) on Days 0-2, 25.7+/-15.2 pg/ml (n=19) on Days 3-5, 47.5+/-52.3 pg/ml (n=18) on Days 6-8, 56.7+/-72.0 pg/ml (n=13) on Days 9-11, 34.2+/-53.1 pg/ml (n=15) on Days 12-14, 20.1+/-18.2 pg/ml (n=10) after Day 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF concentrations of 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> on Days 3-5 and Days 6-8 were significantly higher in patients showing vasospasm as compared to patients not showing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF levels of 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in patients showing vasospasm gradually increased in the days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH and peaked on Days 6-8 </plain></SENT>
