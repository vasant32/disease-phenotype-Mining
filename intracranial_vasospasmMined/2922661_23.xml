<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was produced by percutaneous injection of 4.5 mL of nonheparinized autologous blood into the cisterna magna of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U74006F (1 mg/kg) or placebo was injected intraperitoneally every 12 hours starting 12 hours prior to induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> for a total of six doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed by perfusion fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was removed on day 2 and processed for morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control/placebo and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>/placebo basilar artery diameters were 651.2 +/- 25.4 and 366.3 +/- 34.2 mu, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control/U74006F basilar artery diameters (669.8 +/- 21.8 mu) were not significantly different from that of the control/placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>U74006F treatment greatly minimized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced reduction in mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter (563.7 +/- 48.2 mu) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate considerable therapeutic promise for U74006F in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
