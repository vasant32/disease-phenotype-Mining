<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VSP) is a common complication after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), but has rarely been reported after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) without subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is mainly mediated by circulating <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> products within the cerebrospinal fluid, and thus patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and ventricular involvement (IVH) may also be in danger of developing VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence and role of VSP in IVH, however, have not been systematically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 115 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> with or without IVH into the study between April 2009 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received serial extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) at baseline, on days 3-5 and 7-9 to detect and monitor VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, CT scans taken on admission, after 24 h and before discharge were evaluated for the occurrence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three out of 53 patients (5.7%) with IVH showed a significant elevation of flow velocities over the examined timeframe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients developed severe VSP resulting in secondary ischemic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients without IVH showed significantly elevated flow velocities or secondary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral VSP with secondary infarction may occur in patients with spontaneous IVH, though far less frequently than in SAH; thus, systematic screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with IVH may not be warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, serial TCD should be considered in patients with secondary clinical worsening or extensive IVH </plain></SENT>
