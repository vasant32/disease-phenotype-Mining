<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging using a 0.5- or 0.22-Tesla unit was at least as accurate as computed tomography scan for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was superior to computed tomography scan for demonstrating blood in the ventricles or posterior fossa subarachnoid space, transependymal migration of the cerebrospinal fluid, and several kinds of iatrogenic intracranial pathologies in postoperative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions, particularly fresh lesions caused by delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, were much better shown on magnetic resonance imaging than on computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonferromagnetic Sugita clips caused significant artifacts, but the area of artifacts was consistently smaller, and a reasonable evaluation of structures relatively closer to the clip was possible with magnetic resonance imaging rather than computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
