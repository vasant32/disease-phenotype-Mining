<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors of recent publications have suggested that a combination of cisternal irrigation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> therapy might reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and therefore improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors undertook this prospective nonrandomized Phase II study to analyze the effect of enhanced washout by lumboventricular irrigation in combination with head motion (lateral rotational therapy) on the clot clearance (CC) rate, development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with aneurysmal SAHs of World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grades II-V (Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale Scores 13-3) and Fisher Grade 3 or 4 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study and control groups each consisted of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protocol in the study group, after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was secured and a ventricular drain inserted, included the insertion of 2 lumbar catheters for intrathecal irrigation with Ringer solution and intrathecal pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate head rotation in a kinetic system was also applied and was continued for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CC rate was monitored on daily computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasms were identified clinically with a focus on delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs), daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography studies, and analysis of infarction rate on CT and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data obtained in both groups were statistically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall CC rate did not differ significantly between the groups, but there was a trend toward accelerated resolution in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During observation, a new neurological deficit developed in 1 patient (5%) in the study group and 4 patients (20%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ischemic areas on CT scans related to vasospasm were demonstrated in 2 patients (10%) in the study group and 6 patients (30%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of angiographic vasospasm was approximately the same in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The pooled TCD flow velocities measured over a period of 14 days showed lower mean values in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.00002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome in the study group as evaluated with the modified Rankin scale was better in the study group than in the control group after 3 (p = 0.008) and 6 (p = 0.005) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that a combination of lumboventricular lavage and mechanical head motion reduces vasospasm on TCD ultrasonography, the incidence of DIND, and secondary infarctions on CT and improves clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No obvious effect could be found on the rate of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
