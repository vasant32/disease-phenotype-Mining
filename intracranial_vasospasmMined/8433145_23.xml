<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have evaluated the efficacy of postoperative intrathecal injections of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with a diffuse thick <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined 105 patients who underwent direct surgery within 48 hours of SAH and whose computerized tomography (CT) findings were classified as Fisher CT Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients showing diffuse thick subarachnoid blood clots on CT with greater than 75 Hounsfield units (HU) were included in the tPA therapy group and those with below 75 HU comprised the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical method was the same in both groups, and both groups had cisternal drainage instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the day following the operation, the tPA group was given an intrathecal injection of tPA (2 mg), and this was continued for several days until <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cisterns exhibited low density on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography showed that 26 cases (87%) in the tPA group had no vasospasm, three (10%) had moderate vasospasm, and one (3%) had severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients showing spasm on angiography were asymptomatic, and there were no cases of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were 11 cases (15%) with DIND in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the tPA group, there was one case of SAH caused by drainage catheter removal, one with a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo>, and one with subgaleal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_106'>fluid accumulation</z:mpath>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these were treated conservatively with favorable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no infectious complications related to cisternal drainage and intrathecal injection of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that multiple intrathecal injections of small doses of tPA are effective and safe in preventing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this experience, the authors conclude that injection of 2 mg of tPA daily for 5 days (a total of 10 mg) is effective in preventing the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
