<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The agent with the longest half-life, sudoxicam, clearly reduced both the incidence and the magnitude of the vasopasm, and prevented the usual behavior changes caused by the stimulated SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained with the other agent, naproxen, suggested that it was better than the administration of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These agents were studied because of reports indicating that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of the effects of SAH and because of nonsteroid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> exert pharmacological effects by reducing an excessive synthesis of these <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that some of these agents may afford an alternative treatment for the deterious consequences of SAH </plain></SENT>
