<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the rat model has not yet been fully validated, and there are number of methodological issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present an improved double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rat model for studies of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was induced at an interval of 24h using a PE-10 catheter introduced into the cisterna magna through a parieto-occipital burr hole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood volumes consisted of 0.3/0.2 ml (Group 1) or 0.2/0.1 ml (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with (14)C-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>, and compared to a sham operated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the diameter and cross-sectional area of basilar artery (BA) was measured microscopically at four different levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality in Group 1 was 40%, compared to 1.5% in Group 2 and further experiments focused on the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immediately following the second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the vessel diameter and cross-sectional area of BA were not significantly changed, but by day 5 these had decreased to 64+/-3% and 39+/-4% of control (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CBF changes were global, affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral areas to a similar degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immediately following second SAH induction, CBF diminished to 62-73% of control (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By day 1, CBF had slightly increased above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (101-120%), but there was then a second progressive reduction in flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas examined at day 5 reaching 70-85% of baseline (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBF then normalized by day 7 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present a new technique for creation of double SAH leading to delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
