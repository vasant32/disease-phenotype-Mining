<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate disturbance of perfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventeen patients with aneurysmal SAH specifically selected at high risk for CVS were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twelve patients underwent surgical (n=63) or endovascular (n=59) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For assessment of CVS, relative diameter changes of proximal and distal vessel segments on follow-up angiography at day 7+/-3 after SAH were analyzed in relation to baseline measurements, and cerebral circulation times were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure MRI was undertaken selectively at four time points: within 3 days, between days 4 and 6, day 7 to 14, and day 15 to 28 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related lesions were excluded and CVS-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Occurrence of angiographic CVS was as high as 87.5% between days 7 and 14 and 52.5% showed new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were related to severe CVS (vascular narrowing &gt;66%) and significant (P&lt;0.001) cerebral circulation times prolongation of 8.47+/-2.25 seconds (time-to-peak delay on perfusion-weighted image: 6.52+/-4.75 seconds), 16% were associated with moderate CVS (34% to 66% vascular narrowing; cerebral circulation times prolongation: 4.72+/-0.66 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides territorial (47%), lacunar (20%), and watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (26%), in 7%, band-like cortical lesions developed without evidence for severe CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CVS after SAH may involve the complete arterial system from the circle of Willis up to the distal vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Depending on the variable types of collateral flow, location of affected vessels segments as well as the degree of CVS may induce different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
