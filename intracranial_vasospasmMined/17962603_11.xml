<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is one of the major complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis still remains elusive, and effective therapeutic strategies are yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) in the hypercontractile state in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was used as a model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contractile response to thrombin and the PAR1 expression were evaluated in the isolated rings of basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombin exhibited only a minor contractile effect in the control, whereas it induced augmented contractions in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of PAR1 was upregulated in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injection of PAR1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> E5555 prevented the enhancement of the contractile responses to thrombin in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximal prevention was obtained with 2 microg/kg weight/injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> depolarization or endothelin-1 remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of PAR1 was also prevented by E5555 (2 microg/kg weight/injection) to a level similar to that seen in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo treatment with E5555 (1 micromol/L) inhibited the contraction induced by thrombin, whereas it had little effect on the contraction induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> depolarization or endothelin-1, in the basilar artery of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>E5555 also inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation induced by thrombin, but not trypsin, in cultured smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PAR1 plays a critical role in upregulating PAR1 itself, thereby enhancing the contractile response to thrombin in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PAR1 could thus be a therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the usefulness of PAR1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> remains to be investigated in vivo </plain></SENT>
