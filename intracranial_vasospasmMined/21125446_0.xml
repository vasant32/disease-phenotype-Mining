<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess and to compare the ability of intrathecal dotarizine and nimodipine to prevent and treat vasospasm in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: thirty male New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2,500-3,000 g were allocated into five groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: Control, only SAH, SAH/Dotarizine, SAH/Nimodipine, SAH/Vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after SAH injection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals underwent femoral artery catheterization procedure by open surgery under anesthesia and angiography performed for each animal in the fifth day just before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: basilar artery vessel diameters are measured by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameters and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> sectional areas are measured in pathology slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> dotarizine has marked vasodilatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine is an effect-proven agent in CVS, but dotarizine may take place of it </plain></SENT>
