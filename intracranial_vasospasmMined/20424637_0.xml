<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As proper regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone involves large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent Slo1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (BK, maxiK, K(Ca)1.1) channels, we examined whether BOXes altered functional properties of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological measurements of Slo1 channels heterologously expressed in a human cell line and of native mouse BK channels in isolated cerebral myocytes showed that BOXes markedly diminished open probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biophysically, BOXes specifically stabilized the conformations of the channel with its ion conduction gate closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of chemical amino-acid modifications and molecular mutagenesis together suggest that two specific lysine residues in the structural element linking the transmembrane ion-permeation domain to the carboxyl cytosolic domain of the Slo1 channel are critical in determining the sensitivity of the channel to BOXes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Slo1 BK channels by BOXes may contribute to the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
