<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined how autoregulation is affected by vasospasm by using transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The moving correlation coefficient between slow changes of arterial blood pressure and mean or systolic flow velocity (FV), termed "Mx" and "Sx," respectively, was used to characterize cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was declared when the mean FV increased to more than 120 cm/s and the Lindegaard ratio was more than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This occurred in 15 of 32 SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the bilateral transcranial Doppler recordings of the middle cerebral artery in vasospastic patients, Mx and Sx were calculated for baseline and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mx increased during vasospasm (0.46 +/- 0.32; mean +/- SD) and was significantly higher (P = 0.021) than at baseline (0.21 +/- 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sx was also increased (0.22 +/- 0.26 vs 0.05 +/- 0.21 at baseline; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mx correlated with mean FV (r = 0.577; P = 0.025) and the Lindegaard ratio (r = 0.672; P &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mx (P = 0.006) and Sx (P = 0.044) were higher on the vasospastic side (Mx, 0.44 +/- 0.27; Sx, 0.24 +/- 0.23) when compared with the contralateral side (Mx, 0.34 +/- 0.29; Sx, 0.16 +/- 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased Mx and Sx during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> demonstrate impaired cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mx and Sx provide additional information on changes in autoregulation in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: The moving correlation coefficients between slow changes of arterial blood pressure and mean or systolic flow velocity, termed "Mx" and "Sx," respectively, characterize cerebral autoregulation but have not been applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A study in 15 patients revealed that Mx and Sx were significantly increased, indicating impaired autoregulation during vasospasm as compared with baseline, as well as on the side of vasospasm in comparison with the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
