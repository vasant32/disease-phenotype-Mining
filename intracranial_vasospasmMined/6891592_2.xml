<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm was induced by injecting of 0.2-0.3 ml fresh autologous whole blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diameter of pial vessels was continuously measured by means of the vidicon camera system developed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of nimodipine (0.1 mg/kg) 20-30 min after SAH resulted in a complete disappearance of the spasm with the reduction of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dilatory response was more marked in the smaller arteries (less than 100 microns) than in the larger ones (greater than or equal to 100 microns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of smaller dose of nimodipine (0.01 mg/kg) also produced dilation of the pial vessels, although the effect was less remarkable in the smaller arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that nimodipine might be useful in the treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the action of nimodipine was discussed </plain></SENT>
