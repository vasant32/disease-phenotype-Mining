<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of experimental SAH on the modulatory action of endothelial and nonendothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in the contractile response of goat middle cerebral artery to 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-induced contractile responses of cerebral arteries from control goats and from goats with SAH that had been experimentally induced 3 days earlier by delivery of autologous arterial blood into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses were examined by recording the isometric tension in isolated cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the influence of endothelium, this cell layer was mechanically removed in some of the arteria, segments (rubbed arteries) from both control goats and goats with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In arteries from control goats, contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> were significantly higher in rubbed arteries than in arteries with intact endothelium; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-induced contractions were significantly enhanced by a competitive inhibitor of NO synthesis, NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine, in arteries both with and without endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arteries from goats with SAH, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> contracted cerebral arteries without showing significant differences between segments with endothelium and those that had been rubbed; in both cases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-induced contractions were significantly higher than those obtained in arteries from control goats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">Nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine significantly enhanced the contractile response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> of cerebral arteries from goats with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cerebral arteries after SAH exhibit hyperreactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> via a mechanism that involves the absence of the modulatory role of endothelial NO, that SAH does not modify the modulatory role of nonendothelial NO, and that impairment of the modulatory action of endothelial NO on vascular responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> could contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
