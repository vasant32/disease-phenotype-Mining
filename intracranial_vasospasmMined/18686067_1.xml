<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With regard to the selection of patients, 34 patients belonging to the control group (no UK injection group) underwent the treatment during the 3-year period from 2001 to 2003, while 35 patients belonging to the UK group underwent the treatment during the 3-year period from 2004 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was 5/35 with the UK group, but 12/34 with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The UK injection significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (p = 0.042, Pearson chi-square test), resulting in an improvement shown by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS; p = 0.030, Mann-Whitney U test; Table V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution on the angiographic grading scales for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> significantly shifted in a positive direction for the UK group (mild 0, moderate 5, severe 0) in comparison with the control group (mild 0, moderate 4, severe 8; p = 0.014, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that combining continuous cerebrospinal drainage and intermittent intrathecal UK injection therapy is a relatively simple and effective method for symptomatic vasospasm prophylaxis in patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
