<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In a previous randomized controlled trial, the authors demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> erythropoietin (EPO) therapy reduced severe vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficits (DIDs) following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the potential interaction of neurovascular protection by EPO with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and concurrent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical events of 80 adults older than 18 years and with &lt; 72 hours of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, who were randomized to receive 30,000 U of intravenous EPO-beta or placebo every 48 hours for a total of 3 doses, were analyzed by stratification according to age (&lt; or &gt; or = 60 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, or concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points in the trial included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and impaired autoregulation on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, DIDs, and unfavorable outcome at discharge and at 6 months measured with the modified Rankin Scale and Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed using the t-test and/or ANOVA for repeated measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Younger patients (&lt; 60 years old) or those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> obtained benefits from EPO by a reduction in vasospasm, impaired autoregulation, and unfavorable outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonseptic patients taking EPO, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> taking EPO had a lower absolute reticulocyte count (nonsepsis vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, 143.5 vs. 105.8 x 10(9)/L on Day 6; p = 0.01), suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> impaired both hematopoiesis and neurovascular protection by EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the EPO group, none of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users suffered DIDs (p = 0.078), implying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may potentiate neuroprotection by EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Erythropoietin-related neurovascular protection appears to be attenuated by old age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, an important finding for designing Phase III trials </plain></SENT>
