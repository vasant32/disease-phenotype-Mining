<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The autoregulatory mechanism, including myogenic response, so-called "Bayliss effect", is well developed in the brain circulatory area, where also, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is often encountered after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral artery smooth muscle, protein kinases, such as Rho-associated kinase, tyrosine kinase, and protein kinase C, are activated in response to mechanical stresses, including stretch, pressure and flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these kinases are also activated in due course of time after development of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myogenic response is a kind of reception and subsequent reaction to mechanical stress, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is primarily caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus both myogenic and vasospastic episodes imply a common stress-responding mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It seems possible that various kinases activated by mechanical stress act as not only a physiological signaling but also a proatherogenic/remodeling one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stiffness of vasospastic artery was enormously increased in particular in the late phase of vasospasm, indicating the augmented process of pathologic remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, "Bayliss effect" in modern sense and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can be argued in terms of a stress-reaction of cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
