<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology and prevention of CV is currently of great interest to researchers in various fields of medical science </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, the idea that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> could be playing a major role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has come into the spotlight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study focused on using newly established metallomics techniques in order to explore the proteome associated with CV and if <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> might affect the discovered proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, along with LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF were both essential in determining protein identifications in three different sample types; a control (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, healthy patient, CSF control), SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (no vasospasm, CSF C) and SAH CV patients (CSF V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study, although preliminary, indicate the current methods are applicable and warrant further application to these clinically important targets </plain></SENT>
