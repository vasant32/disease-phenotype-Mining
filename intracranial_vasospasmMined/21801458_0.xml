<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) is a common serious complication after the spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in medical and surgical treatments, the 30-day mortality rate of SAH remains high, and there is lack of especially effective clinical treatment to alleviate and improve CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study has investigated the therapeutic effect of insulin and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> on CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five days after SAH, there is obvious basilar artery spasm in SAH group, whose average vascular cross-sectional area (233,099 ± 16,750 μm²) is significantly smaller than that in control group (462,128 ± 74,756 μm²), which is also significantly different from those in SAH + insulin group (221,114 ± 43,457 μm²) and SAH + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> group (237,820 ± 21,703 μm²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH + insulin + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> group shows no evident vasospasm and maintains a vascular cross-sectional area of 425,530 ± 45,503 μm², which is significantly different from that in SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin receptor α (InRα) expression is significantly downregulated in the vascular endothelial cells of SAH, SAH + insulin, and SAH + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> groups (P &lt; 0.01) but remains unchanged in vascular endothelial cells of SAH + insulin + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five days after SAH, serum and cerebrospinal fluid NO levels in SAH, SAH + insulin, and SAH + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> groups decrease significantly (P &lt; 0.01) compared to that in control group, whereas the reduction is not evident in SAH + insulin + <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combinatorial treatment with insulin and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> has effectively relieved the CVS after SAH in rabbit, possibly through increasing the InRα expression and NO level, whereas treatment with insulin or <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> alone fails to do so </plain></SENT>
