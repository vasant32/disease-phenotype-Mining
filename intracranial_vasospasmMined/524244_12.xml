<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There exists a considerable difference in the development of sclorosis in intracranial and extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries were already stiff at birth and become stiffer with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their increase in stiffness is attributable to the marked thickening of their walls, which compensates for the decrease of their elasticity with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries constrict more than extracranial arteries, although the maximum active stress developed is essentially the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This competency of intracranial arteries for vaso-constriction may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
