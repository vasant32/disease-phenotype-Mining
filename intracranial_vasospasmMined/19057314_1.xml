<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A controlled-release system consists of an active material that is incorporated into a carrier, usually in the form of a pellet or a gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With such systems, the desired agent is delivered slowly and continuously, for long periods of time, directly to the desired site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technology makes it possible to achieve high local concentrations of therapeutic agents while minimizing systemic toxicity and circumventing the need to cross the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review describes controlled-release systems developed to date for local drug delivery in the treatment of CVS in both animal models and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A MEDLINE PubMed database search was performed for articles published from 1975 to 2007 with the following search topics: "controlled-release system/polymer," "controlled-release implants," "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>," "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>," "subarachnoid space," and "intracranial drug delivery." RESULTS: Over the past several decades, several controlled-release systems (lactic/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi> pellets, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>, liposomes, <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomers) have been developed to deliver various pharmacological agents (papaverine, nicardipine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>, calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, fasudil, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) intracranially to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in animal models (rats, rabbits, dogs, and primates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animal studies have shown promising results, and the few human studies that have been published using controlled-release systems with papaverine or nicardipine report similarly encouraging outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Controlled-release systems have evolved over the past few years and have been shown experimentally to be an effective strategy for the local delivery of drugs to treat CVS </plain></SENT>
