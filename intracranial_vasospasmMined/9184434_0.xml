<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arachnoid membrane covering the cerebral arteries in the basal cistern was dissected and fibrin glue was applied to the adventitial surface of the arteries in three groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, the arachnoid membrane was extensively dissected and fibrin glue was widely applied to the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, the dissection and coating was less extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 3 was a control group in which the arachnoid membrane was dissected but fibrin glue was not applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography 1 week later clearly demonstrated vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six dogs in Group 1 and in four of six dogs in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm did not occur in Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dogs were sacrificed and the arteries in the basal cistern were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological investigation showed typical findings of vasospasm and inertness of fibrin glue to the tissue </plain></SENT>
