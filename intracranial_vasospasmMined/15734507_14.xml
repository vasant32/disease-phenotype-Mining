<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Fisher grade (FG) is widely used to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We revisited the grading scale to determine its validity in the era of modern management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 134 patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount and distribution of subarachnoid blood on admission computed tomography (CT) scan was quantified according to the FG and compared with development of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 134 patients (median age, 54) who presented with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six (5%) were FG 1, 34 (25%) were FG 2, 25 (19%) were FG 3, and 69 (51%) were FG 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm developed in no (0%) FG 1, 8 (24%) FG 2, 7 (28 %) FG 3, and 13 (19%) FG 4 patients (28 of 134 total patients; 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development of symptomatic vasospasm was not associated with admission FG, Hunt and Hess grade, age, sex, or location of blood on presenting CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity was associated with blood in the basal cisterns (P = .0047), lateral ventricles (P = .026), or blood in any ventricle (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiograms were obtained in 57 patients; moderate to severe vasospasm was observed in 5 (15%) FG 2, 6 (24%) FG 3, and 14 (20%) FG 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (71%) with symptomatic vasospasm had moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm was associated with intraventricular blood (P = .054) but not with FG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 21% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The FG correlated with symptomatic vasospasm in only half the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A new predictive CT grading scale for vasospasm may be necessary </plain></SENT>
