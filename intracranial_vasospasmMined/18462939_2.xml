<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, activators of smooth muscle BK channels may be potential therapeutic tools to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> associated with vasoconstriction and/or impaired dilation, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> and constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16325">lithocholic acid</z:chebi> (LC) and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35519">cholane</z:chebi> derivatives activated smooth muscle BK channels and, thus, caused endothelium-independent cerebral artery dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, clinical use of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35519">cholane</z:chebi> derivatives could be limited by the actions of these steroids, such as elevation of intracellular calcium and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using LC as template, we designed and synthesized a series of hydroxy-alkynoic acids and corresponding <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>, as putative, non-steroid BK channel activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the newly synthesized compounds effectively and reversibly activated rat cerebrovascular myocyte BK channel at concentrations similar to those found effective with LC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the novel compounds tested, C-10 hydroxy-alkynoic acid <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> appears to be the most effective activator of vascular myocyte BK channels </plain></SENT>
