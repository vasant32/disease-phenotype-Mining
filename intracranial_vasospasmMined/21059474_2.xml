<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The etiology of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCV) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence supports a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of DCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We showed that CSF neutrophils predict which patients will develop DCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated a murine model of SAH to test the hypothesis that myeloid cells are required for the cerebral damage associated with DCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAH was associated with decreased middle cerebral artery caliber on day 1 which normalized at day 3 and recurred at day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, behavioral testing with a Barnes maze showed executive dysfunction that progressively worsened after the seventh day post <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test the role of innate immune responses, we administrated a myeloid cell-depleting monoclonal antibody against Ly6G/C prior to experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myeloid cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> ameliorated angiographic vasospasm measured by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vessel caliber and normalized behavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings support the role of Ly6G/C(+) cells in the development of DCV after SAH and suggest that immune modulation of neutrophils or other Ly6G/C(+) cells may be a strategy for the prevention of DCV </plain></SENT>
