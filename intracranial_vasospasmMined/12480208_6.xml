<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent and long-acting vasoconstrictive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ET-1 has been shown to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients after SAH, and substances produced during <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of subarachnoid blood clots are believed to be responsible for stimulating the production of ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of ET-1 is a multi-step process, involving the conversion of the relatively inactive precursor big ET-1 to the mature <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> by endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), a metalloprotease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, ECE inhibitors are expected to suppress the biosynthesis of ET-1 and reduce the pathologic impact resulting from overproduction of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of an ECE inhibitor, CGS 26303, on hemolysate-induced injury of cerebral vessel endothelial cells as well as the production of ET-1 from these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Different doses of CGS 26303 and hemolysate were added to the culture medium for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell injury was assessed by cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and density, while the productions of ET-1 and big ET-1 were determined by radioimmunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemolysate alone increased the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 in culture medium and caused substantial cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS 26303 inhibited the hemolysate-induced increases in the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 and reduced endothelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of CGS 26303 were modest when this inhibitor was added simultaneously with hemolysate, but were prominent and dose-dependent when the inhibitor was given 30 minutes before the addition of hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that overproduction of ET-1 contributes significantly to hemolysate-induced damage to cerebrovascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
