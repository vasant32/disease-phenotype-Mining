<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> are poorly understood, although an increase in smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphorylation has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study set out to determine if phosphatase inhibition may be involved in the pathological maintenance of tension observed during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that 1 nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi>, a type 2A protein phosphatase inhibitor, elicited an increase in rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> consumption in the porcine carotid artery similar to that by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from vasospastic patients (CSF(V), n=5) (control 0.23+/-0.03, CSF(V) 0.84+/-0.16 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> 0.85+/-0.02 micromol min(-1) g dwt(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also observed that phosphatase inhibition with 1 nM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> significantly slowed relaxation after a stretch in a similar fashion to CSF(V) haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF from vasospastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients, but not from those without vasospasm, contains an extractable substance which modulates myosin light chain phosphorylation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A phosphatase preparation obtained from the porcine carotid artery dephosphorylated 63+/-2% of the phosphorylated (MLC(20)) substrate in vitro, and non-vasospastic CSF treated enzyme dephosphorylated 60+/-2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">Okadaic acid</z:chebi> inhibited phosphatase dephosphorylated only 7.5+/-1% of the substrate where CSF(V) treated enzyme dephosphorylated 22+/-2.8% of the substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inhibition of smooth muscle phosphatase may be involved in the mechanisms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
