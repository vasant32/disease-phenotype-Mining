<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and angiographic vasospasm and the value of rCBF in predicting vasospasm and the prognosis are not fully delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the changes in extent of vasospasm-induced decreased cortical rCBF on three-dimensional (3D) displays of single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical usefulness of these assessments was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 58 cases of SAH, SPECT and digital subtraction angiography were performed on the same day, 5-9 days after SAH or within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow data were assessed by measuring the area of decreased cortical rCBF on 3D SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area of decreased cortical rCBF on the 3D images was significantly increased in cases with DIND (P &lt;.001), in cases with a large infarction due to vasospasm (P =.006), and in cases with a poor prognosis after vasospasm (P =.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These increases were also related to the type of angiographic vasospasm; the greatest decrease in cortical rCBF occurred in the combined type (combination of the peripheral and proximal types) of vasospasm, followed by cases with the peripheral type, proximal type, and no angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with DIND, patchy decreased cortical rCBF areas were seen before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined-type vasospasm leads to reductions in CBF greater than those due to isolated peripheral or proximal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional and mean-hemispheric CBF analyses are less sensitive for this change than is 3D SPECT </plain></SENT>
