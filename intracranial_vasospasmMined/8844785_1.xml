<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) or sympathectomy on vascular smooth muscle function, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved, by recording the responses to nor-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in isolated carotid arteries in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were performed before and 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> model was created in rabbits by injecting autologous arterial blood into the subarachnoid space of the rabbits via cisterna magna punction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of vasospasm following SAH <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) was given to the animals and cervical and periarterial sympathectomy was performed in the other groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In isolated carotid arteries <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/l) and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/l) produced concentration-dependent contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These contractile responses were significantly enhanced in animals 7 days after SAH compared to controls and did not return to control values in carotid arteries obtained from animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> or sympathectomy for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that SAH causes supersensitivity in the carotid as well as cerebral arteries during the first week after SAH and could contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and sympathectomy after SAH did not reduce the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> or sympathectomy during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of vasospasm after SAH did not affect the vascular responses of the extradural part of the carotid artery to vasoactive substances </plain></SENT>
