<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that TNF-alpha measured from brain interstitial fluid would correlate with the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a consecutive series of 10 aSAH patients who underwent cerebral microdialysis (MD) and evaluation of vasospasm by CT angiogram (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), TNF-alpha levels from MD were measured at 8-hour intervals from aSAH days 4-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An attending neuroradiologist blinded to the study independently evaluated each CTA and DSA and assigned a vasospasm index (VI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a VI&lt;2 and 5 patients had a VI&gt;2, where the median VI was 2 (range 0-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median log TNF-alpha area under the curve (AUC) was 1.64pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.48-1.71) for the VI&lt;2 group, and 2.11pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.95-2.47) for the VI&gt;2 group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this small series of poor-grade aSAH patients, the AUC of TNF-alpha levels from aSAH days 4-6 correlates with the severity of radiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis in a larger population is warranted based on our preliminary findings </plain></SENT>
