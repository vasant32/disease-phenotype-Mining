<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">Sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S1P) is a platelet-derived bioactive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> that exerts a variety of biological responses, including vasocontraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the involvement of S1P in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we investigated the effect of S1P on vasocontraction of the canine basilar artery in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recorded isometric tension in basilar arterial rings from dogs in vitro and estimated time-course changes in the diameter of canine basilar arteries and the S1P concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by angiography and radioreceptor assays, respectively, after administering S1P into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the supernatant S1P concentration during clot formation were monitored by using the in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> model, in which blood is mixed with CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At concentrations ranging between 100 nmol/L and 10 micromol/L, S1P induced a dose-dependent contraction of the basilar artery in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was significantly inhibited by Y-27632, a highly selective Rho-kinase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of S1P into the CSF induced a 60% to 70% decrease in the arterial diameter within 15 minutes, and vasocontraction continued for 2 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of S1P in the supernatant during clot formation in vitro reached approximately 300 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S1P induces vasocontraction in the canine basilar artery in vitro and in vivo, possibly through a mechanism involving activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, S1P might be considered as a novel spasmogenic substance involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
