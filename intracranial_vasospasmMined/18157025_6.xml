<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report adverse events that were encountered intraoperatively and in the postoperative period in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 17 patients documenting demographic data, preprocedure medical history, intraoperative, and postoperative <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> complications was conducted between January 2002 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients underwent 210 treatments under general anesthesia with a mean of 12.4+/-7.2 treatments per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>Focal seizures</z:hpo> occurred in 13% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generalized motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred in 4 treatment sessions in 2 different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was significantly higher when the internal carotid artery was used for injection, as opposed to the vertebral artery (20.8% and 6.02%, respectively, P=0.0034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>Tachycardia</z:hpo> associated with ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> occurred 9 times (4.3%) in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had significant ST segment elevation (more than 1.5 mm) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> were observed in 11.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After emergence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and obtundation occurred in 7.6% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and reversible motor deficits was 6% and 3.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our review highlights the problems that were encountered during blood brain barrier disruption under anesthesia and in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are required for comprehensive evaluation of intraprocedure and postprocedure complications that will allow development of an optimal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> plan and will improve patient outcome by preventing potential complications </plain></SENT>
