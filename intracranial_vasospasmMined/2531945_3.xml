<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible relation between neuropeptides and cerebral vasoconstriction in samples of ventricular or cisternal cerebrospinal fluid from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and pituitary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> 7B2 were present in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and 7B2 were not significantly different from those in control subjects, but that of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the mean concentration of neuropeptide Y was not significantly higher than control, consecutive determinations showed an increase 6-11 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An initially high 7B2 concentration decreased gradually, although half the patients showed a second increase greater than 10 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering the well-recognized vasoconstrictive effect of neuropeptide Y, it is possible that this increase in its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid plays a role in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that is often seen after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
