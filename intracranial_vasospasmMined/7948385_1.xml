<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the possible role of foreign-body reaction to extravasated blood in provoking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, talc (crystallized hydrous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="29241">silicate</z:chebi>) was injected as a non-biologic foreign material into the canine-cisterna cerebellomedullaris, and pathologic changes were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, this cisternal talc injection induced delayed and prolonged constriction of the basilar artery, without any evidence of so-called early phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that should occur shortly after an insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, around the spastic artery in the subarachnoid space with talc injection, the appearance of a moderate cellular migration coincided with cerebral vasoconstriction, which took place 2 days after the talc injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the spastic basilar arterial wall, marked constrictive and degenerative changes including myonecrosis and subintimal proliferation were induced by cisternal talc injection as early as on day 2, and the changes were progressive with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These pathologic changes were extremely analogous to those of the human autopsy cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> VS) but more prominent than those observed in the experimental autologous blood-induced model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that a foreign-body reaction to talc alone could induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> VS in the absence of extravasated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible to consider that inflammatory reactions to extravasated autologous blood in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may give rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> VS </plain></SENT>
