<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cranial opening was drilled, and a puncture made on the posterior branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second puncture was made in the superior sagittal sinus for additional withdrawal of subarachnoid blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> thus induced resulted in arterial spasm which was studied by using serial electrocorticograms, cerebral blood flow measurement with 133Xe, and videomicroscopy of the small pial vessels at various intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the animals, the brains were observed to identify the extention of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was indeed obvious that large amounts of subarachnoid blood clots had accumulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This investigation showed that the rabbit can be used as a new experimental model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a two-puncture method, it is possible to simulate the clinical phenomenon of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, that seems to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the latter, the accumulation of blood clots in the basal surfaces plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The three methods of observation, videomicroscopy, cerebral blood flow measurements, and electrocorticography appeared to provide useful information in the study of biphasic vasospasm in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
