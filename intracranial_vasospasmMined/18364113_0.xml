<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesized that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endothelial cells induced by p53 and its target gene em dash p53 upregulated modulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (PUMA) played an important role in development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also observed the effects of a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha), on reducing the expression of p53 and PUMA, consequently decreasing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endothelial cells and alleviating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g were randomly divided into five groups: a control group (sham surgery), a SAH group, a SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) group, a SAH + PFT-alpha (0.2 mg/kg) group and a SAH + PFT-alpha (2.0 mg/kg) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PFT-alpha was injected intraperitoneally immediately after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the levels of p53, PUMA and caspase-3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, mortality and neurological scores were assessed for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was assured by analysis of variance performed in one way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurological and mortality scores were analyzed by Dunn's method and Fisher exact test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After SAH, Western blot and immunohistochemical staining showed the levels of p53, PUMA and caspase-3 in the endothelial cells and the numbers of TdT mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labelling (TUNEL) positive endothelial cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly increased in the basilar arteries (P&lt;0.05), but significantly reduced by PFT-alpha (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by increasing diameters and declining wall thickness of basilar arteries (P&lt;0.05), as well as reduced mortality and neurological deficits of the rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PFT-alpha could protect cerebral vessels from development of vasospasm and improve neurological outcome as well as reduce the mortality via suppressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by p53 in the endothelial cells of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
