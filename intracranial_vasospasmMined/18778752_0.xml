<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial papaverine (IAP) has been used widely to increase the regional cerebral blood flow in order to reverse the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that occurs during endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IAP-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> have been reported, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> has anticonvulsive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study determined the effects of IAP on electrocorticography (ECoG) in the ketamine anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 200-250 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided randomly into four groups: three treatment groups (groups 1-3) and a control (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Groups 1, 2, and 3 were given 1, 7, and 14 mg/kg IAP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ECoG was compared across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that IAP did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and that it decreased the frequency of ketamine-induced epileptiform activity in the 14 mg/kg group </plain></SENT>
