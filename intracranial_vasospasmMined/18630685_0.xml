<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned into three groups: contrast group, experiment group and blank group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every group contained 8 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was established according to inject blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experiment group was administrated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg x d) transperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET and NO of plasma and CSF were detected by radical immunoassay at 72 h and 168 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurofunction were detected in every group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the time scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) After SAH, the level of ET in CSF increased significantly in contrast group compared with that in experiment and blank groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of ET at 168 h was higher than that at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of ET in plasma increased significantly in contrast group compared with blank and experiment groups (P&lt;0.05), and no significant contrast could be found between blank and experiment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) After SAH, the value of NO in CSF was lower in contrast group than in other groups (P&lt;0.05), and the level of NO in CSF continued to decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups on some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As time went by, no significant contrast could be found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The value of NO in plasma was lower in contrast group than in other groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between experiment and blank groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) The neuro-function score continued to be increased in contrast group, but decreased in experiment one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The neuro-function score was lower in experiment group than in contrast one at every time point (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>, the variation of ET has the continued decrease in plasma and CSF; the variation of NO shows the continued increase in plasma and CSF; neurological function gets possibly protected </plain></SENT>
