<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An investigation of the time of appearance of vasospasm as seen angiographically after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was carried out on 797 cases of intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in which operations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that vasospasm often occurs early after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, vasospasm occurred within three days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in only 4.2% of the 120 cases in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance of vasospasm was most frequently seen angiographically between ten and 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this period vasospasm was seen in 49.1% of 116 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those cases with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> one to 17 days before the last one, vasospasm within three days after the last <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was seen in 38.7% of 62 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the period between ten and 17 days after the last <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, vasospasm was seen in only 20% of 25 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which had occurred between one and 17 days before the last <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, seemed to be responsible for the high rate of vasospasm within three days after the last <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and the low rate of vasospasm in the period between ten and 17 days after the last <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
