<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the changes of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 levels in brain tissue in rat with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and the protective effect of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats were divided randomly into SAH group, nimodipine-treated group and sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diameters of basilar artery before and after operation were measured, and dynamic changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), brain nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 levels were determined within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination of hippocampus was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAH resulted in significant and persistent decrease of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diameter of basilar artery was reduced markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurons in hippocampus CA1 subfield were damaged severely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 levels in brain tissue were increased significantly from 1 h to 24 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the pathological changes of above parameters were not so severe in nimodipine-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increase of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 levels in brain tissue is probably involved in the development of ischemic brain damage caused by CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine exerts its protective effect on brain neurons by antagonizing CVS and the pathological changes of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
