<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chem., 18: 980-983, 1972) with a minor modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were serially collected every a few days for three days to four weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DBH activity in peripheral venous plasma increased markedly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, reaching the highest level within 48 hours, and thereafter declined time-dependently for about two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the plasma DBH activities on admission between patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> revealed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decline of the activity was significantly remarkable in patients with spasm compared with those without spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference was most prominent around the 7th day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> when spasm was shown most frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgery or administration of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="35" ids="35717">sedatives</z:chebi> had little effect on the changes in plasma DBH activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activity correlated with the pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (r = 0.587, P less than 0.05), when it was higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With these results we obtained following: 1) The activity of sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system increases following SAH for a week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2) The activity declines more rapidly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> than those without spasm, when it was judged from the activity of plasma DBH activity </plain></SENT>
