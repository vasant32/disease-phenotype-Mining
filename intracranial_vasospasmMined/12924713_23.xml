<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), also called CD54, appears to be a crucial step in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is increasing experimental evidence that blocking the interaction between ICAM-1, which is expressed on endothelium, and integrins such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18) and macrophage antigen-1 (complement receptor 3, CD11b/CD18), which are expressed on the surface of leukocytes,prevents not only <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of vessel walls but also <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors extend their previous work with monoclonal antibody (mAb) blockade of leukocyte migration to a nonhuman primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, posthemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Before surgery was performed, six young adult male cynomolgus monkeys underwent baseline selective biplane common carotid and vertebrobasilar artery cerebral angiography via a transfemoral route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 0, a right frontosphenotemporal craniectomy was performed with arachnoid microdissection and placement of 2 to 3 ml of clotted autologous blood in the ipsilateral basal cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were given daily intravenous infusions of 2 mg/kg of either a humanized anti-CD11/CD18 or a placebo mAb beginning 30 to 60 minutes postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The monkeys were killed on Day 7 after a repeated selective cerebral angiogram was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area of contrast-containing vessels observed in each hemisphere on anteroposterior angiographic views was calculated for the angiograms obtained on Day 7 and expressed as a percentage of the area on baseline angiograms (percent control areal fraction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Review of flow cytometry and enzyme immunoassay data confirmed the presence of the anti-CD11/CD18 antibody in the serum and bound to leukocytes in the peripheral blood of treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the groups revealed 53 +/- 4.8% control vascular areal fraction in the placebo group (two animals) and 95.8 +/- 9.4% in the anti-CD11/CD18-treated group (three animals), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.043, t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that blockade of leukocyte migration into the subarachnoid space by an anti-CD11/CD18 mAb is effective in preventing experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in nonhuman primates, despite the unaltered presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These experimental data support the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
