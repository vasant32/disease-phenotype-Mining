<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After stretching and rapid release in vitro localized constrictions promptly occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This could be prevented by prior treatment with <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> or calcium-free solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once produced, constrictions persisted for more than 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously induced constriction was not reversed by treatment for two hours with <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> or by removing calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological observation indicated that constricted areas were associated with a discrete circumferential rupture of the internal elastic lamina and disruption and thinning of the underlying media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> fluorescence at the adventitio-medial junction was unchanged in constricted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between smooth muscle cell length and resting tension of artery segments with and without constrictions was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Segments with constrictions had a shorter muscle length for any given resting tension, which confirms that constriction was not due to passive collapse of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that injury of cerebrovascular smooth muscle may result in essentially irreversible vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism could contribute to the pathogenesis of prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH or traumatic injury to the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
