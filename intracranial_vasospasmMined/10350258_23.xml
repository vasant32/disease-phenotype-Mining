<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The role of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is a well-established vasodilatory substance; however, in SAH, NO may become a major source for the production of injurious <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> species, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactive overproduction of NO to counteract vascular narrowing might potentiate the detrimental effects of NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focus of the present study is to determine the extent of reactive induction of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm was induced in male Wistar rats by an injection of autologous blood (100 microl) into the cisterna magna followed by a second injection 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group of 10 animals was treated with injections of 0.9% <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was verified by pressure-controlled angiography after retrograde cannulation of the external carotid artery 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 15 animals radiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The animals were perfusion fixed and their brains were removed for immunohistochemical assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the aid of a microscope, staining for iNOS was quantified in 40-microm floating coronal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for iNOS was markedly more intense in animals with significant angiographic evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Virtually no staining was observed in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the second experimental SAH, labeling of iNOS was found in endothelial cells, in vascular smooth-muscle cells, and, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, in adventitial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Some immunohistochemical staining of iNOS was observed in rod cells (activated microglia), in glial networks, and in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates induction of iNOS after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
