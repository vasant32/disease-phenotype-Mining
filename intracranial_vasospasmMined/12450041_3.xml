<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH may compromise CBF and increase the risks of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no effective treatment for SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct stimulation of the trigeminal nerve has been shown to dilate constricted cerebral arteries after SAH; however, a noninvasive method to activate this nerve would be preferable for human applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that stimulation of free nerve endings of trigeminal sensory fibers in the face might be as effective as direct stimulation of the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autologous blood obtained from the tail artery was injected into the cisterna magna of 10 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight and 96 hours later (five rats each) trigeminal afferents were stimulated selectively by applying transcorneal biphasic pulses (1 msec, 3 mA, and 30 Hz), and CBF enhancements were detected using laser Doppler flowmetry in the territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation-induced changes in cerebrovascular parameters were compared with similar parameters in sham-operated controls (six rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Development of vasospasm was histologically verified in every rat with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Corneal stimulation caused an increase in CBF and blood pressure and a net decrease in cerebrovascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups for these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present study demonstrate that transcorneal stimulation of trigeminal nerve endings induces vasodilation and a robust increase in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vasodilatory response of cerebral vessels to trigeminal activation is retained after SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
