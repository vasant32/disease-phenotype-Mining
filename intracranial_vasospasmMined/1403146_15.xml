<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO was obtained before and after cerebral angioplasty in 10 patients with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had clinically evident neurologic improvement after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual interpretation and an internal-reference (cerebellum), manual, semi-quantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed improvement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 9 out of 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were disagreements between the visual and ROI analysis in the two that did not improve clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10, the average increase per anterior circulation vessel dilated (n = 17) was 8.8% by comparison of the corticocerebellar ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the eight that improved, the average increase was 10.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT is valuable for evaluating delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by vasospasm after SAH and is useful to document the changes in rCBF induced by angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is possible that SPECT may be useful to detect critical reductions in perfusion before clinical deficits develop, thereby offering the potential to identify candidates for early treatment with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
