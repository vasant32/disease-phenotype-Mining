<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the early diagnostic methods and therapeutic principles of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using neuro-imaging examinations combined with case history and clinical symptoms to make the early diagnosis of 96 case with aneurysmal SAH, and Guglielmi detachable microcoil (GDC) was utilized for early intracapsular embolization in the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficient symptomatic treatment was done early after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of 96 cases were early diagnosed and successfully embolized; Among them, the aneurysmal lumen was 100% occluded in 83 cases, 95% in 8 cases, 90% in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 3 cases complicating with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> rupture during operation, 5 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case was affected by microcoil terminal escape after operation, 3 recurrent cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cured with secondary GDC embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 9 complications associated with embolization techniques and 13 cases (13.5%) occurring permanent sequelae associated with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the Glasgow prognosis score, 77 patients got grade I, 7 grade II, 6 grade III, 3 grade IV, and 3 grade V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To make early etiological diagnosis of the SAH patients, using GDC to embolize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and earlier efficient symptomatic treatment are important methods to improve the curative rate and reduce the mortality rate </plain></SENT>
