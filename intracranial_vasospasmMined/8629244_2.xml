<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The possible role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has been noted in recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, we examined the vasocontractile activity of talc, which is known to cause severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, using a canine cisternal talc injection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under general anesthesia, a <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> talc powder suspended in saline was injected into the cisterna magna of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial vertebral angiography and postmortem histologic changes of the harvested basilar artery were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphologic and pharmacologic features of talc-induced vessel spasm were compared with the usual autologous blood-induced artery spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cisternal injection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> talc powder caused no early spasm, but induced definite basilar arterial constriction 2 days after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This vascular constriction was observed to continue up to 7 days after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural study of the constricted vessel revealed several morphologic changes, such as corrugation of the elastic lamina, subintimal proliferation, migration of smooth muscle cells, detachment of endothelial cells, etc.; findings that are compatible with the changes observed in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic study showed a moderate decrease in the maximal contraction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly disturbed, while endothelium-independent relaxation was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These pharmacologic properties were also similar to those reported in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our present study indicates that the several changes of vascular properties, which had been considered to be specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, can be regarded as a nonspecific biologic defense reaction against the foreign body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the common pathway from talc and autologous blood to vasospasm may lead to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
