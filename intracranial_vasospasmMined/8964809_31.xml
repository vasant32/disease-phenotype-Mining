<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight monkeys underwent cerebral angiography and induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography was repeated 7 days later to confirm the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from right (vasospastic) and left (control) side middle cerebral arteries and surrounding cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of prepro (PP) ET-1 (ppET-1) and ppET-3 and <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">MRNAs</z:chebi> were determined using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET-1 peptide was also measured in CSF at baseline and after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> binding to <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptors in both middle cerebral arteries and in surrounding brain cortex was measured in three animals by autoradiographic binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were 3.4 +/- 2.2-fold higher in the right than in the left cerebral arteries (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of ppET-1, ppET-3, or <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were 2.6 +/ 1.1- and 2.1 +/ 1.3-fold higher, respectively, in the right than in the left cerebral cortex, while the level of ppET-3 mRNA was 2.1 +/- 1.0-fold lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in ppET-1 mRNA levels between right and left cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Binding to <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> and ETB receptors in cerebral arteries and cortex did not differ significantly between right and left sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the hypothesis that overexpression of ET-1 is principal cause of vasospasm, but rather they suggest that SAH causes complex changes in the ET system that together are responsible for the cellular response to SAH </plain></SENT>
