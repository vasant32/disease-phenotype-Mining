<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean velocity gradually decreased on the 10th postoperatively day and became a plateau at 200% of preoperative value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility index as a index of cerebral vascular resistance was low just after the operation, became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> the following day and gradually increased 10 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes seem to be recovery of cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
