<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND and PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) impairs both contraction and relaxation response in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> might be ATP-independent contraction, such as latch state, and protein synthesis might be substantially downregulated due to ATP consumption after long-lasting contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced in the canine 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and spastic basilar arteries were stabilized in Krebs-Henseleit solution, and contraction was induced by 30 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi>) in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and at 15 minutes and 1 hour after the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi>, the levels of phosphorylated 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time course of expression of contraction proteins actin and MLC20, and contraction-inhibiting proteins h-caldesmon and calponin was determined by immunoblotting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant vasospasm occurred in the basilar artery during days 4 to 21, most prominently on days 7 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the baseline levels of phosphorylated MLC20 between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and spastic basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in MLC20 phosphorylation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> was significantly attenuated in the spastic basilar artery in vitro and in vivo (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity for actin, h-caldesmon, and calponin in the spastic basilar arteries was progressively decreased until day 14 and returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, protein levels of MLC20 did not significantly change during days 0 to 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> closely resembles the latch state, and temporary deficiencies of contractile proteins may result from increased destruction and inhibition of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
