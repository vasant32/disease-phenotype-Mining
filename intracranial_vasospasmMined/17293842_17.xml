<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the potential role of NF-kappaB in regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB DNA-binding activity was measured in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with hemolysate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 80 micromol/L), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two rabbits were divided into three groups: control, SAH, and PDTC groups (n=14 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The caliber of the basilar artery was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappaB DNA-binding activity and the gene expression levels of cytokines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the basilar artery were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study was performed to assess the expression and localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was observed that NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was significantly increased by treatment with hemolysate in cultured VSCMs, but this increase was suppressed by pretreatment with PDTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm was observed in the SAH group, which was attenuated in the PDTC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> could induce increases of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and the gene expression levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, ICAM-1, and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (VCAM)-1, which were reduced in the PDTC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that the expression levels of TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and MPO were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased in the SAH group, but these increases were attenuated in the PDTC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that NF-kappaB is activated in the arterial wall after SAH, which potentially leads to vasospasm development through induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
