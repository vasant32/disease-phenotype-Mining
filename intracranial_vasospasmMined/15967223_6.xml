<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) after aneurysmal rupture and compared with levels of ET-1 in volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze the relationship between levels of ET-1 in both CSF and plasma with the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples were collected from 30 selected patients after SAH and from 10 healthy volunteers who were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were stored at -70 degrees C and the levels of ET-1 in CSF and blood were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were submitted to angiography to confirm vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 30 patients admitted at different days of SAH, 18 (60%) developed clinical CVS and 10 (33%) presented angiographic CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of ET-1 in the CSF were significantly higher (P = .0001) in patients (1.618 +/- 1.05 fmol/mL) than in controls (0.365 +/- 0.328 fmol/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was statistical difference (P &lt; .05) in CSF levels of ET-1 between each group of the Hunt-Hess scale and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma concentration of ET-1 was similar (P &gt; .05) in the control group (1.531 +/- 0.753 fmol/mL) and in patients with SAH (1.920 +/- 1.15 fmol/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a significant rise in ET-1 levels in the CSF, but not in the plasma, occurs in patients who develop CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observation suggests that ET-1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of SAH-associated CVS </plain></SENT>
