<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An increased level of endothelin (ET)-1 seems to be involved in the development of augmented cerebrovascular resistance in different pathological conditions, most notably vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, interfering with the ET synthesis or ET receptor blockade may be a promising approach in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the receptors mediating the effects of ET-1 human cerebrovasculature are well characterized, data concerning the functionally relevant ET-converting enzyme (ECE) activity are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ECE activity was determined in organ bath studies by the use of intraoperatively harvested human pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of ECE activity was analyzed by comparing the shift in the concentration effect curves obtained for ET-1 and its precursor, big ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of ECE-1alpha immunoreactivity was studied in human cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECE-1alpha immunoreactivity was found, although not consistently, in human cerebral arteries and was restricted to the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In isolated pial arterial segments, ET-1 and big ET-1 induced concentration-related contractions with mean pD(2) values of 9.25 +/- 0.34 and 7.13 +/- 0.17, respectively, yielding a 123-fold shift of big ET-1 versus mature ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with phosphoramidon (10(-4) mol/L) resulted in a small yet significant inhibition of the contraction induced by big ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate the presence of functional ECE activity and ECE-1alpha immunoreactivity in human cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data suggest the presence of ECE-like activity that differs from that of ECE-1alpha </plain></SENT>
