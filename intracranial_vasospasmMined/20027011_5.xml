<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of NSE and S100B from CSF and serum for the prognosis of outcome and the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, vasospasm and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 55 patients with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and requiring external ventricular drainage the concentrations of NSE and S100B were determined daily from the serum and the CSF from admission until day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At ICU discharge patients' outcome was assessed by the Glasgow outcome scale and occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, vasospasm and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean and peak values of each parameter for each patient were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For accuracy assessment receiver operating characteristics were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bad outcome (Glasgow outcome scale 1 to 3) was found in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e>, vasospasm, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were found in 31 (56%), 34 (62%), and 36 (65%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean and peak values of NSE CSF (P&lt;0.001), S100B CSF (P&lt;0.001), and S100B serum (P&lt;0.001) but not of NSE serum provided the ability to distinguish between patients with good and bad outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of NSE CSF and S100B CSF did not differ significantly from that of S100B serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NSE CSF (P&lt;0.001), S100B CSF (P&lt;0.001), and S100B serum (P&lt;0.001) allowed the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NSE CSF, S100B CSF, and S100B serum provide similar prognostic values for outcome, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
