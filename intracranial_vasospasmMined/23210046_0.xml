<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to verify the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) volume (not Fisher grade) and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who visited our hospital with a diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clot seen on computed tomography (CT), taken within 48 hours after SAH and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was confirmed by CT Angiogram (CTA) from March 2010 to July 2011 were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTA was checked at least twice after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm (AVS) on CTA was defined as irregularity or narrowing of intracranial vessels on follow up CTA compared with initial CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) volume (subdural, SAH, intracerebral and intraventricular) was calculated and SAH volume (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> supratentorial and infratentorial cisterns) was also calculated using the MIPAV software package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty six patients did not show AVS on CTA or clinical deterioration (non vasospasm group: NVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AVS without ischemic neurologic symptoms was observed in four patients and development of symptomatic vasospasm (SVS), defined as AVS with ischemic symptoms, was observed in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAH volume in SVS patients was statistically larger than that in NVS patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> volume in SVS patients was larger than that in NVS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicate an association of development of vasospasm with the SAH volume, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
