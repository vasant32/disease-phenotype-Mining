<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> animal model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were sacrificed from day 1 to day 8 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intimal corrugation of the basilar artery and the amount of cerebral <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase in the hypothalamus and brain stem were measured each day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospastic changes occurred in the biphasic manner following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More profound vasospastic corrugation occurred in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, followed by a slightly less intense corrugation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (between days 5 and 8 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, a clear concomitant biphasic time course developed in the form of an increased amount of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-beta-hydroxylase in the noradrenergic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of the rabbit hypothalamus and brain stem during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant correlation between basilar artery corrugation and the amount of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possible role of the central sympathetic system in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time, this study demonstrates the chronological similarity of the vasospastic development after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the animal experimental model with the human time course of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
