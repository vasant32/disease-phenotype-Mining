<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relaxant response of human middle cerebral arterial strips to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15554">PGH2</z:chebi> was also suppressed by hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dog and monkey middle cerebral arteries responded to transmural electrical stimulation and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> with transient relaxations, which were quite susceptible to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi> and hexamethonium, respectively; the relaxations were abolished almost completely by hemolysate and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the relaxant response of dog cerebral arteries to a low concentration of K+ was not influenced by hemolysate or by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, but was reversed to a contraction by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relaxations induced by substance-P and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> were markedly inhibited by hemolysate; removal of endothelium abolished the relaxation by substance-P, but did not influence the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate may interfere with the biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> in the vascular wall, thereby reversing the relaxation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15554">PGH2</z:chebi> to a contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relaxations induced by electrical and chemical stimulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nerves innervating cerebral arteries appear to be elicited by a mechanism dependent on cellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>), like that underlying the substance-P-induced and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced relaxation </plain></SENT>
