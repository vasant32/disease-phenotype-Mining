<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite intensive investigation into the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (focal ischemic deficit) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition remain high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various studies have shown levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and it is possible that these vasoactive substances play an important role in the subsequent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to elucidate this possibility, the study presented here was undertaken to investigate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels in plasma and CSF and focal ischemic deficit (FID); the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on blood vessels supplying the hypothalamus as compared with the rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on blood vessels supplying other areas of the brain; and the clinical outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> in plasma and CSF samples obtained from 21 patients who had suffered aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were determined by a radioenzymatic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> were found at the time of surgery in the CSF of patients with FID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar trend, though not statistically significant, was also observed for plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on blood vessels supplying the hypothalamus showed a tendency towards higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels in plasma and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a bad clinical outcome (i.e., those who were severely disabled or had died) had significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> in plasma than did those with a good clinical outcome (i.e., those with moderate or no disability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further detailed analysis of the interrelationships showed that, within the group of patients with FID, those with rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on blood vessels supplying the hypothalamus had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels in plasma than did those with rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on other cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the group of patients with rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on blood vessels supplying the hypothalamus, those with a bad clinical outcome had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels in plasma than did those with a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings lend support to the possibility that damage to the hypothalamus and subsequent elevations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels may be associated with FID and poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
