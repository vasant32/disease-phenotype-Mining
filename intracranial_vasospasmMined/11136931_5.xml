<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to explore the inhibitory effect of U0126, a novel MAPK inhibitor, in the contraction of the rabbit basilar artery by 3 spasmogens: hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The contraction and relaxation of rabbit basilar arteries were measured by isometric tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAPK immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Pretreatment of the rabbit basilar arteries with U0126 reduced contractions to hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, or bloody CSF applied subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) In the absence of endothelial cells, U0126 produced an inhibitory effect similar to the contractions induced by hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, or bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) U0126 relaxed the sustained contraction induced by hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, or bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) Hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and bloody CSF enhanced MAPK immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(5) U0126 reduced MAPK immunoprecipitation induced by hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(6) Hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and bloody CSF significantly increased MAPK activity in the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(7) U0126 abolished the effect of hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, or bloody CSF on MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a role of MAPK in the contraction of rabbit basilar arteries by hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAPK inhibitor U0126 may be useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
