<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation dilates the ipsilateral arteries of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dog anterior circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experiment tested whether similar stimulation would reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six dogs underwent baseline angiography followed by creation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days later, subarachnoid blood injection was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, angiography was repeated and the left sphenopalatine ganglion was exposed microsurgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was repeated 15 minutes after exposure of the ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ganglion was then stimulated electrically 3 times and angiography repeated during, and 15 and 30 minutes after stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protocol was repeated again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adequacy of stimulation was confirmed by the presence of immediate ipsilateral nasal mucus production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was associated with significant vasospasm of both middle cerebral arteries (11% +/- 4% and 18% +/- 7%, P &lt; .05, paired t tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the ganglion and sham stimulation produced no substantial changes in arterial diameters compared with the diameter before stimulation and after ganglion exposure (n = 2-6 per measurement, paired t tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ganglion stimulation produced significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ipsilateral extracranial and intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries compared with the contralateral arteries (13% +/- 6% to 32% +/- 14%, P &lt; .05, paired t tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mild to moderate vasospasm that results from SAH in dogs was reversed by sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since this method carries a potential for human application, additional studies are warranted to determine the effects on more severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
