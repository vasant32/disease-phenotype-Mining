<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> syndrome has been linked to worse outcomes in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed systemic interleukin (IL)-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, to determine whether its concentration differs between patients with non-aSAH and those with aSAH, reflecting the more benign illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daily systemic IL-6 levels were measured in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase in 11 patients with non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic SAH (pmSAH), with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> strictly located around the midbrain, and in nine patients with non-aneurysmal non-perimesencephalic (non-pmSAH), with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> extending into adjacent cisterns (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 levels were compared with those from patients suffering from aSAH with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) (group 2) and without CVS (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean IL-6 level (±standard error of the mean) was significantly lower in group 1 compared to group 2 (9.9±1.9 vs. 29.1±6.7 pg/mL, p=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in mean IL-6 level between group 1 and 3 fell short of significance (9.9±1.9 vs. 14.9±1.1 pg/mL, p=0.073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 1 had a significantly better outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4-5) compared to group 2 (p&lt;0.001) and a trend towards better outcome compared to group 3 (p=0.102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis revealed a higher mean IL-6 concentration in patients with non-pmSAH compared to patients with pm-SAH (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that systemic IL-6 concentration reflects the severity of the inflammatory stress response and course of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The more benign illness and good prognosis of patients with pmSAH or non-pmSAH in contrast to patients with aSAH is reflected by the lower concentrations of IL-6 </plain></SENT>
