<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral haemorrhages were visualised via TCCS as hyperechogenic areas, which were closely correlated in size and location to CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from the imaging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhages</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e>, TCCS permitted the identification of the angiographically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Brain tumours</z:e> were delineated in the vast majority of the patients examined </plain></SENT>
