<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy diminished vasospasm-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as assessed using daily measurements of serum S100B, a biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and computed tomography measurement of ischemic lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center study of cases and historical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neurointensive care unit in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> treated with clipping or coiling within 96 hrs of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n = 278) were included from April 2004 to October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, 40 mg/day for 21 days, was used routinely starting on December 1, 2005, in 142 patients, who were compared with the 136 patients managed earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ischemic lesion size was measured using computed tomography on the last available scan and serum S100B was assayed daily for 15 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic narrowing was semiquantitatively assessed in patients with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the overall population, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was significantly less common in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severity of vasospasm, as assessed on the most severe angiogram, was lowered with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> significantly reduced volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients with vasospasm and an uncomplicated coiling procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>S100B levels were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated patients, and the decrease was greatest among high-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated and untreated groups regarding rescue therapy intensity or 1-yr clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> reduces the incidence, the severity and the ischemic consequences of vasospasm as assessed on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In high-grade World Federation of Neurological Surgeons patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> decreases serum levels of S100B, a biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite these positive effects on biomarkers, no improvement of outcome was seen in the overall population, although there was a tendency for a better clinical outcome in high-grade patients </plain></SENT>
