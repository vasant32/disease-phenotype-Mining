<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the usefulness of three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with SAH who were suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on the basis of their clinical symptoms were examined by 3D-CTA with a spiral CT scanner after an intravenous bolus administration of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA revealed vasospastic changes of the cerebral vessels in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography was performed in six patients immediately after the 3D-CTA examination, and demonstrated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, a second 3D-CTA was performed with the same technique one week after the first 3D-CTA examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second 3D-CTA showed the cerebral vessels without vasospastic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 3D-CTA is a promising, minimally invasive strategy for the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
