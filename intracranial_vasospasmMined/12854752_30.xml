<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inspired by organ culture-induced changes in the receptor phenotype of cerebral arteries, the authors investigated possible changes in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) receptor phenotype after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental SAH was induced in rats by using an autologous prechiasmatic injection of arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days later, the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), posterior communicating artery (PCoA), and basilar artery (BA) were harvested and examined functionally with the aid of a sensitive in vitro pharmacological method molecularly by performing quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and BA the 5-HT1B receptor was upregulated, as determined through both functional and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to selective 5-HT1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> both the negative logarithm of the 50% effective concentration was increased (one log unit in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and one half unit in the BA), as was the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>'s potency (increased by 50% in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and doubled in the BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors found an approximately fourfold increase in the number of copies of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> coding for the 5-HT1B receptor as determined by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the PCoA no upregulation of the 5-HT1B receptor was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the receptor phenotype in favor of contractile receptors may well represent the end stage in a sequence of events leading from SAH to the actual development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insight into the mechanism of upregulation may provide new targets for developing specific treatment against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
