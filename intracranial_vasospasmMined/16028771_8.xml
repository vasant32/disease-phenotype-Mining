<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The disturbed balance between nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and endothelin (ET)-1 in the cerebrovasculature seems to play a major role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 represents the contractile part in this balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the prevailing ET(A) receptor-dependent contractile effect, ET-1 also has ET(B) receptor-mediated vasodilatory attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to define the actual selectivity of clazosentan, the first putative highly ET(A) receptor-selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> clinically proven to be effective in the treatment of vasospasm in the cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat basilar artery ring segments with endothelial function were used for the measurement of isometric force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentration effect curves were constructed by cumulative application of sarafotoxin S6c, ET-1, or big ET-1 in the presence or absence of clazosentan (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) after a precontraction was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition by clazosentan was estimated by the value of the affinity constant (pA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relaxation induced by sarafotoxin S6c, ET-1, and big ET-1 was inhibited in a competitive manner by clazosentan, yielding pA2 values of 7.1, 6.7, and 6.5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The selectivity to the ET(A) receptor in the cerebrovascular system was approximately two logarithmic units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation shows a competitive inhibition of ET(B) receptor-mediated relaxation in cerebral vessels by clazosentan in therapeutically relevant concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional clinical trials should be undertaken to evaluate clazosentan concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the present data may be taken to describe the pharmacological properties for an ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> specifically tailored for the treatment of pathological conditions of impaired cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
