<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing endovascular interventions through the graft in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative period following EC-IC bypass are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results, complications, and technical nuances are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen endovascular procedures were performed in 5 patients after EC-IC bypass for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 4 patients and posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, a saphenous vein graft (SVG) was used to bypass the common carotid artery (CCA) to the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent a superficial temporal artery (STA)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass, and in 2 other patients the STA stump was connected to the intracranial circulation via an interposition SVG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interval from surgery to endovascular intervention spanned 2-18 days; the indication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case involved angioplasty of the proximal anastomosis on postoperative Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other interventions entailed proximal access through the bypass conduit for intraarterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant vasospasm of the STA itself was encountered in 2 patients during endovascular manipulation, and it was treated with intraarterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of anastomotic disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular catheterization and intervention involving a recent EC-IC bypass is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main limitation in this series was catheter-induced vasospasm involving the STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A vein graft may be the more appropriate option in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who may require subsequent endovascular intervention for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
