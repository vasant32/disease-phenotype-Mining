<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> at nonbranching sites in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA), known as blood <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blister</z:mp>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (BBAs), are rare entities and differ from saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we attempt to describe our clinical experience and the outcome of treatments for BBAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirteen of 745 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) who visited our institution between March 2005 and July 2010, and were confirmed to have BBAs at nonbranching sites of the supraclinoid ICA by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or computed tomography angiography, were followed-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, several therapeutic managements were provided depending on their clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed included patient age, sex, World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons (WFNS) scale, time interval from first DSA to second DSA, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and the modified Rankin scale score at follow-up, 6 months after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Of these 13 patients, 5 underwent rapid configuration change from blood <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blister</z:mp>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to saccular-shaped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different therapeutic managements were provided, including clipping on wrapping material in 2 patients, ICA trapping without extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass in 3 patients, EC-IC bypass and ICA trapping in 3 patients, transarterial endovascular therapy in 3 patients, direct clipping in 1 patient, and external ventricular drainage in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good clinical outcome was achieved in 4 patients, whereas the other 9 patients had moderate to severe disability due to rebleeding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BBAs of the supraclinoid ICA have special neuroradiological and clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct clipping or endovascular coil embolization along may not be sufficient and sometimes have undesirable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICA trapping or ligation including the lesion segment can be considered an alternative choice if the balloon occlusion test (BOT) is successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, if the patient does not tolerate the BOT, EC-IC bypass surgery with ICA ligation or trapping is another option </plain></SENT>
