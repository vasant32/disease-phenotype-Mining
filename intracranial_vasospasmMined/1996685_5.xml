<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injections of autologous blood, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E2 and PGF2 alpha also constricted the artery to a similar extent, although the peak response was obtained much later (approximately 1 wk) with blood and was earlier (approximately 20 min) with PGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictor action of HbO2 was almost abolished by treatment for 5 h with aspirin in dogs and monkeys, whereas treatment of dogs with OKY 046, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor, did not significantly alter the action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In isolated monkey basilar arteries, HbO2 elicited a concentration-related contraction, which was suppressed by treatment with aspirin and by endothelium denudation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha with contractions comparable to those caused by elevated external K+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> in the nutrient solution bathing dog and monkey cerebral arteries were increased by HbO2; the increment was depressed by endothelium denudation and by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cerebral artery constriction caused by HbO2 in vivo and in vitro is associated mainly with the release of vasoconstrictor PGs, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelium appears to play an important role in the release of PGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> elicited by intracisternal injections of HbO2 may be a useful model for the analysis of mechanisms underlying the provocation of delayed vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
