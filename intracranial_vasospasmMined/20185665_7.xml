<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vasospasm is a potentially devastating complication after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although endovascular treatment with intraarterial nicardipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> is an accepted clinical treatment strategy, there is little information either on hemodynamic management during treatment or on outcome and consequences of the hemodynamic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) intraarterial administration of nicardipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> would require increased administration of vasoconstrictor to support arterial blood pressure at target levels; and (2) high-dose vasopressors administered to increase blood pressure in these patients would lead to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> and end-organ ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of consecutive patients with clinically symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> that failed medical management with "triple H therapy" and subsequently received intraarterial nicardipine and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> between March 2005 and July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 160 endovascular interventions in 73 patients (aged 52 +/- 10 years; 50 women), 96 received only nicardipine, 5 only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi>, and 59 both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia with muscle relaxation was performed for 93% of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During treatment, both the number and dose of vasopressors required to maintain arterial blood pressure at target levels increased; the median dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> increased from 200 (n = 121) to 325 microg/min (n = 122), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> increased from 12 (n = 60) to 24.5 microg/min (n = 87), and vasopressin infusions increased from 7 to 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, arterial blood pressure decreased 13% during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In &gt;90% of procedures, the postprocedure angiogram showed improved vessel caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single patient demonstrated troponin T increase; no patients had a decrease in renal function, bowel or peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial administration of nicardipine and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> requires use of vasopressors to maintain arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite high doses of vasoconstrictors, treatment has low mortality, minimal end-organ ischemic damage or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, and results in improved caliber of cerebral vessels affected by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
