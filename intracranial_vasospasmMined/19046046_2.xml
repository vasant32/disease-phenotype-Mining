<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) carries a severe prognosis, which is often related to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though several clinical and radiological predictors of vasospasm and functional outcome have been established, the prognostic value of histopathological findings remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histopathological findings in resected distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> walls were examined, as were the clinical and radiological factors in a series of 91 patients who had been neurosurgically treated for aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of the histological, clinical, and radiological factors on the occurrence of vasospasm and functional outcome at discharge was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathological findings frequently included lymphocytic infiltrates (60%), <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (60%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (50%) of the resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, clinical (Hunt and Hess grade) and radiological (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size) factors as well as histopathological features-namely, lymphocytic infiltrates and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall-were significantly associated with the occurrence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, lymphocytic infiltrates (OR 6.35, 95% CI 2.32-17.36, p = 0.0001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.42, p = 0.009) remained the only factors predicting the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A poor functional outcome at discharge was significantly associated with vasospasm, other clinical factors (Hunt and Hess grade, alcohol consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and elevated white blood cell count [WBC] at admission), and radiological factors (Fisher grade and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size), as well as with histopathological features (lymphocytic infiltrates [p = 0.0001] and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall [p = 0.0015]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis taking into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical, radiological, and histological factors; vasospasm (OR 9.82, 95% CI 1.83-52.82, p = 0.008), Hunt and Hess grade (OR 5.61, 95% CI 2.29-13.74, p = 0.0001), patient age (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, p = 0.0013), elevated WBC (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.64, p = 0.04), and Fisher grade (OR 4.35, 95% CI 1.25-15.07, p = 0.015) best predicted functional outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of lymphocytic infiltrates in the resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall is of independent prognostic value for the development of vasospasm in patients with neurosurgically treated aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, histopathology might complement other clinical and radiological factors in the identification of patients at risk </plain></SENT>
