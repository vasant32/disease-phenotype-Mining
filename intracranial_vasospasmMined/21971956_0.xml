<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the biology of SAH-expressing cerebrum, we employed oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize the gene expression profiles of cerebrum tissue at the early stage of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional gene expression in the cerebrum was analyzed 2 h following stage 1-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was investigated by performing microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses, and protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, 18 upregulated and 18 downregulated genes displayed at least a 1.5-fold change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five genes were verified by real-time PCR, including three upregulated genes [<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E synthase (PGES), CD14 antigen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1)] as well as two downregulated genes [KRAB-zinc finger protein-2 (KZF-2) and Î³-aminobutyric acid B receptor 1 (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> B receptor)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, there were functional implications for the three upregulated genes involved in the inflammatory SAH process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms leading to decreased KZF-2 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> B receptor expression in SAH have never been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that oligonucleotide microarrays have the potential for use as a method to identify candidate genes associated with SAH and to provide novel investigational targets, including genes involved in the immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, understanding the regulation of MMP9/TIMP1 during the early stages of SAH may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms in SAH rats </plain></SENT>
