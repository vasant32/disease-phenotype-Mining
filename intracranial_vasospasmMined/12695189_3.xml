<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We developed an experimental canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model in which one-time blood injection by means of a microcatheter into the ventral cisterna magna (CM) is performed without direct CM puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the severity and duration of the vasospasm produced in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fresh autologous blood (0.25 or 0.5 ml/kg) or saline (0.5 ml/kg) was injected into the ventral CM of dogs through a microcatheter inserted at the lumbar region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial angiograms were obtained on days 3, 7, 10, and 14, and chronologic changes in the mean diameter of the basilar artery (BA) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BA was examined histologically on day 7 after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A remarkable amount of clot was present in front of the brain stem at 24 hours after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clot was smaller in the 0.25 ml/kg SAH than in the 0.5 ml/kg SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 3, narrowing of the BA was apparent in both SAH groups compared with the control (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BA gradually returned to nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on day 14 in the 0.25 ml/kg SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing was more severe and persistent in the 0.5 ml/kg SAH than in the 0.25 ml/kg SAH group (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the BA on the 7th postinjection day confirmed narrowing of the lumen, indicative of arterial spasm, in both SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our method of SAH induction by means of a single injection of blood directly into the ventral CM through a microcatheter induced severe, prolonged spasms in the canine BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because our model facilitates the induction of different-sized clots, we could control of the severity and duration of the induced vasospasms </plain></SENT>
