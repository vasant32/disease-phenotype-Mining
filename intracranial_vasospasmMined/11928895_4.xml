<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amongst the known substances inducing vasospasm, the most potent spasmogenic effect is exerted by endothelin-1 (ET1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The constriction of cerebral arteries and obliteration of capillaries highly stimulates the secretion of growth factors by endothelial cells and induces compensatory formation of collateral circulation in response to brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the main factor responsible for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular permeability, was found to be increased in hypoxic cells (irrespective of the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) as well as in neoplastic cells in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> of endothelial cells stimulate expression of VEGF, and whether blockage of the endothelin receptor ET(A) reduces this expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SAH was induced experimentally in male Wistar rats and the ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>--BQ-123 was administered into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours the brain was removed and expression of VEGF studied immunohistochemically on paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> of endothelial cells, induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm after SAH, caused increased expression of VEGF in brain vessels and neurones of the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin receptor antagonist</z:chebi> BQ-123, no changes in VEGF expression in the brain were found </plain></SENT>
