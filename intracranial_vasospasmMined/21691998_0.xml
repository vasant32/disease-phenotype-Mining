<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many kinds of proteins can be transduced into various cells by conjugation with 10-20 amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A sequence of 11 consecutive arginine groups (11R) is one of the most efficient protein transduction domains (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the 32-kDa heat shock protein <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a therapeutic protein for experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This protein is an enzyme of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-catabolism and cleaves <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HO-1 has known vascular relaxing properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the transduction efficacy and antispastic therapeutic effect of 11R fused HO-1 protein in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 11R fused HO-1 protein was expressed purified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of 11R-HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An antispastic effect was investigated in a rat model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> by measuring basilar artery diameters 4 h after the injection of 11R-HO-1 into the cisterna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Expression and purification of 11R-HO-1 could be successfully effected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transduction into the basilar artery was also successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>11R-HO-1 protein has the positive effect of attenuating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the 11R-HO-1 protein transduction method has a potential to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
