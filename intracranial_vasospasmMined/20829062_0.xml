<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A critical event participating in such responses is the recruitment of circulating leukocytes into the inflammatory site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD34 is a key <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule responsible for recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and the attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been investigated whether, and to what degree, CD34 is induced by SAH and also the role of CD34 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the timecourse of the CD34 expression in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, we chose the maximum time point of vasospasm (day 3) and assessed the effect of monoclonal antibody against CD34 on regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, the elevated expression of CD34 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and peaked on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal administration of CD34 monoclonal antibody, the vasospasm was markedly attenuated after blood injection on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CD34 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rat experimental model of SAH and administration of the specific CD34 antibody could prevent or reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
