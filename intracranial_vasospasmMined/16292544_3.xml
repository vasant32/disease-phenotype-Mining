<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow should therefore be monitored with a simple, reliable method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial color-coded Doppler sonography (TCCS) is an accepted tool for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; however, its usefulness in evaluating patients with head injury has not been proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood-flow velocity in the middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries was measured with a 2.5 MHz probe (Aplio SSA 770A, Toshiba, Japan) in 36 subjects with moderate or severe head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of resistance index (RI), peak-systolic, end-diastolic, and mean velocity in the middle cerebral arteries were performed 2-24 h after head trauma and in the subsequent days during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after head trauma, increased RI values, and unusually decreased blood-flow velocity (mainly in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microcirculation disturbances were suspected because the end-diastolic velocity had substantially diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood-flow parameters correlated with the clinical state, and in most cases, a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some patients, blood-flow velocity increased above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference limit and this implied poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcranial color-coded Doppler sonography is a reliable, repeatable, and accessible tool that provides information about cerebral blood-flow disturbances and may hold diagnostic and prognostic importance </plain></SENT>
