<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Medical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) includes hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilution ("triple-H") therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information regarding the indications and guidance used to initiate and adjust triple-H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 43-item questionnaire was e-mailed to 375 members of the Neurocritical Care Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questions were designed to investigate the diagnostic approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and prophylactic and therapeutic administration of triple-H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 167 respondents (45% response proportion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of respondents worked in hospitals with neurointensive care units (NICUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH patients in hospitals with a NICU had longer ICU stay (P = 0.037) and had indwelling central venous catheters for longer (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Centers without dedicated NICUs were more likely to induce prophylactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven percent of respondents (n = 45) reported using prophylactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> in patients with SAH, while 100% reported inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> for severe or symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent (n = 20) of respondents reported inducing prophylactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with severe or symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Half of respondents relied on the mean arterial pressure and half on systolic blood pressure as the clinical parameter for blood pressure titration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most widely used agents to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (48%) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was little variation in the use of hemodilution therapy comparing patients with or without evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial differences in the administration of prophylactic triple-H, but there was high agreement on indication for therapeutic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was wide variability in the extent of ICU monitoring, diagnostic approach, physiologic parameters and values used as target of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NICU availability was associated with more intensive monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Lack of evidence and guidelines for triple-H therapy might largely explain these findings </plain></SENT>
