<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if CT perfusion-derived hemodynamic parameters are predictors of vasospasm severity and outcome after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAH was induced in 25 New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) were measured with CT perfusion before SAH, within 1 hour after SAH, and on days 2, 4, 7, 9, and 16 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery diameter, measured with CT angiography and neurologic scoring, was also obtained on the same days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between animals with moderate-severe delayed vasospasm (&gt;/=24% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e>) and mild delayed vasospasm (&lt;24% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e>) were investigated with repeated measures analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between CT perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), basilar artery diameter, and neurologic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> increase &lt;1 hour after SAH independently predicted mortality within 48 hours of SAH (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and neurologic deficits were significantly greater with moderate-severe than with mild vasospasm (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> on day 2, but not CBF or CBV, was a significant predictor of subsequent moderate-severe delayed vasospasm (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the rabbit model of experimental SAH, the CT-derived hemodynamic parameter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> on day 0 predicted early mortality, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> on day 2 predicted development of moderate-severe delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was also significantly correlated with arterial diameter and neurologic score </plain></SENT>
