<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e>, we used fluorescence microscopy, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and pharmacological studies in intact cerebral arteries to pinpoint the molecular effectors of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> cerebrovascular constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant concentrations of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> elevated wall intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and caused a reversible constriction of cerebral arteries (EC(50) = 27 mM; E(max) = 100 mM) that depended on voltage-gated Ca(2+) entry into myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> did not directly increase voltage-dependent Ca(2+) currents in isolated myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constriction occurred because of an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> reduction in the frequency (-53%) and amplitude (-32%) of transient Ca(2+)-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (BK) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> inhibition of BK transients was caused by a reduction in Ca(2+) spark frequency (-49%), a subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) signal that evokes the BK transients, and a direct inhibition of BK channel steady-state activity (-44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> failed to modify Ca(2+) waves, a major vasoconstrictor mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selective block of BK channels largely prevented <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> constriction in pressurized arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study pinpoints the Ca(2+) spark/BK channel negative-feedback mechanism as the primary effector of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
