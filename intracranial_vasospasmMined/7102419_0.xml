<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cisternal CSF in patients with vasospasm contained a significantly higher level of NE (0.246 +/- 0.0490 ng/ml) compared with those without vasospasm (0.075 +/- 0.001 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this increase is not considered to be high enough to constrict cerebral arteries, unless there is an increased NE-sensitivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular responses to NE in vivo were then studied after reversing blood-induced prolonged vasospasm of the rabbit's basilar artery through a transclival approach as well as a newly developed basal cisternal irrigation model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, NE in molar concentrations between 1 x 10(-10) and 10(-2) failed to produce further contraction of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the increase in NE with vasospasm might be only a secondary phenomenon, and not a causative factor of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early removal of subarachnoid blood clots seemed to prevent the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
