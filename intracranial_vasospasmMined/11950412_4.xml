<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Complementary <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> array analysis was used to determine whether vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is associated with changes in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Right SAHs were created in three monkeys, and the right and left middle cerebral arteries were collected 3, 7, or 14 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was assessed by angiography performed on Day 0 and at tissue harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complementary <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> array containing 5184 genes was used to screen for changes in gene expression by comparing the right and left middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant expression (greater than fivefold expression of messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> compared with internal standard control) of 537 genes (10%) in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-four genes (31%) did not change significantly, and 373 (69%) were differentially expressed at 3, 7, or 14 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 373 genes changed from 1.2- to 7-fold as compared with control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common pattern was a progressive increase with increased time after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functions of differentially expressed genes included the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, membrane proteins and receptors, kinases, and phosphatases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a marked increase in parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone receptor with time after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting demonstrated a significant increase in parathyroid hormone receptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of these proteins involved in vascular relaxation suggests that they may play a role in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The progressive increase in messenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">ribonucleic acids</z:chebi> involved in the functions noted suggests that the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> involves cell proliferation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and possibly smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> change </plain></SENT>
