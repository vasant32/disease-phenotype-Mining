<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the same time, free radicals are generated, and because of deficient scavenging mechanisms in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these free radicals cause <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation effect the cerebral arterial wall from the very early stage, probably infiltrating the wall through channels of the wall opening to the CSF space to exhibit inflammatory changes such as subintimal cell proliferation, myonecrosis etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation also leads to degradation of membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) and to rise in the intracellular level of diacylglycerol (DAG), an intrinsic protein kinase C (PKC) activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent release of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> from PC (and/or PE) stimulates the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> cascade which generates various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> and free radicals contributing to inflammatory changes in the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the intracellular level of DAG is increased, the PKC system is more and more activated, resulting in the development of sustained smooth muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This, together with inflammatory changes in the arterial wall, forms the full-fledged picture of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, leading to delayed ischaemic neurological deficits (DINDs) </plain></SENT>
