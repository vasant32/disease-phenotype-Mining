<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current management often requires subjective judgments concerning presumed abnormalities of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a combined intracranial pressure (ICP)-laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) fiberoptic probe that permits continuous monitoring of local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was used in the postoperative management of 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this probe, lCBF was simultaneously recorded and integrated on a real time basis with other physiological parameters, including ICP, systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulse oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined probe also provided the ability to obtain precise and detailed information concerning the presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> vascular reactivity, and allowed calculation of the cerebral vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous monitoring of lCBF in this manner complemented by transcranial Doppler and angiographic data permitted early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, helped to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and hyperemia, was useful in titrating blood pressure and fluid management, provided direct feedback about the effectiveness of instituted therapies, and determined early on when medical management was of no avail and that interventional neuroradiology was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence is presented that the presence of angiographic vasospasm and increased velocities on TCD do not always correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the microcirculation and that direct measurements of lCBF are often at variance with calculations of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) </plain></SENT>
