<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The haptoglobin 2-2 genotype likely increases the risk for developing posthemorrhagic vasospasm, but potential treatments for vasospasm have never been tested in an animal model of this genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">diethylenetriamine</z:chebi> (DETA)/NO incorporated into <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> (EVAc) polymers to evaluate the efficacy of controlled NO repletion in a haptoglobin 2-2 mouse basilar artery SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mice were randomized to 3 groups: autologous blood injection and empty polymer implantation into the subarachnoid space (n = 16); blood injection and 30% DETA/NO-EVAc implantation (n = 20); and sham operation (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after surgery, activity level was assessed on a 3-point scale, and basilar arteries were processed for morphometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte extravasation was assessed by immunohistochemistry (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with controlled release of NO from DETA/NO-EVAc polymers after SAH resulted in a significant increase in basilar artery lumen patency (73.3% +/- 4.3% versus 96.5% +/- 4.3%, mean +/- standard error of the mean; P = 0.01), a significant improvement in activity after experimental SAH (2.14 +/- 0.14 versus 2.56 +/- 0.10 points; P = 0.025), and a significant decrease in extravasated leukocytes (21 +/- 4.55 versus 6.75 +/- 3.77 leukocytes per high-power field, untreated versus treated mice; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with controlled release of NO prevented posthemorrhagic vasospasm in haptoglobin 2-2 mice, and mitigated neurological deficits, suggesting that DETA/NO-EVAc would be an effective therapy in patients with a genotype that confers higher risk for vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of leukocyte migration may contribute to the therapeutic mechanism of NO </plain></SENT>
