<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients, however, are referred to treatment several hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the course of hemodynamic parameters, cerebral blood flow, and tissue oxygenation (ptiO2) in the first 6 h after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SAH using the endovascular filament model or served as controls (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral local cortical blood flow, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and ptiO2 were followed for 6 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After induction of SAH, local cortical blood flow rapidly declined to 22% of baseline and returned to 80% after 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decline of local cortical blood flow markedly exceeded the decline of cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ptiO2 declined to 57%, recovered after 2 h, and reached &gt; or =140% of baseline after 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vasoconstriction after SAH is indicated by the marked discrepancy of cerebral perfusion pressure and local cortical blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The excess tissue oxygenation several hours after SAH suggests disturbed oxygen utilization and cerebral metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aside from the sudden increase of intracranial pressure at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasoconstriction and disturbed oxygen utilization may be additional factors contributing to secondary brain damage after SAH </plain></SENT>
