<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although mice, rats, and other small animals are commonly used for molecular biology research, their use in the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is somewhat problematic because of the correspondingly small size of their cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have already reported that the corrosion cast technique was useful for evaluating newly formed cerebral vessels in neural grafts in these small animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we applied the corrosion cast technique to the evaluation of hemolysate-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rats and performed three-dimensional analysis for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The casting was done 10 minutes after the hemolysate injection, so that only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> "vasospasm" was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After withdrawal of 0.1 mL cerebrospinal fluid, 0.2 mL hemolysate (n = 9) or saline (n = 10) was injected into the cisterna magna of male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 300 and 350 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes later, perfusion of a semipolymerized casting medium was performed at an injection pressure of 100 to 120 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were immersed and corroded in 10% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32145">NaOH</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After these procedures, the basilar artery as well as peripheral vessels was analyzed morphologically with scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional histological analysis with the use of paraffin-embedded section with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining was also performed, and the results were compared with those for the corrosion cast methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the saline-injected group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> showed that the inner surface of the basilar artery was smooth and the form of the endothelial cell was printed on the surface of the cast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the hemolysate-injected group, the basilar artery showed an apparent vasospasm over its entire length, and corrugation was observed on the inner surface of the basilar artery in a three-dimensional fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher magnification revealed that the nuclei of the endothelial cells were distorted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Local narrowing of the basilar artery and vasospasm in the arteries of the anterior circulation and in peripheral arteries were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the inner diameter of the basilar artery showed 37.8% contraction in the hemolysate-injected group compared with the saline-injected group by the corrosion cast method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This degree of vasospasm was similar to that observed by the conventional histological method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this report we show that detailed three-dimensional observation in the rat can be performed qualitatively and quantitatively with the corrosion cast technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this method derives an accurate measurement of the diameter of rat major cerebral arteries and is more reliable for analyzing vasospasm in rats than angiography and other conventional procedures </plain></SENT>
