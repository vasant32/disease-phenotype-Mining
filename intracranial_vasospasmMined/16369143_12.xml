<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that various constituents of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> may be critical in the pathogenesis of this ischemic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the C-reactive protein (CRP)/white blood cell (WBC) count and DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 88 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRP and WBC count were estimated on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated 1 year after the initial ictus according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRP levels on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 were statistically significantly higher in the group of patients developing a DIND (P &lt; 0.025, P &lt; 0.016, P &lt; 0.011, P &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WBC counts were higher in this patient group on days 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (P &lt; 0.0253, P &lt; 0.0087, P &lt; 0.00167, P &lt; 0.0026, P &lt; 0.0045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall CRP values were higher with increasing severity of the initial ictus according to the Hunt and Hess Scale and to the outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale from day 3 on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant relationship between WBCs and outcome could not be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presented data do not prove that WBCs and CRP values have a direct contribution to the pathogenesis of ischemic complications following SAH, but it supports the assertion that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may present a common pathogenic pathway in the development of such complications </plain></SENT>
