<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the therapeutic effect of human extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (ECSOD) gene transfer in the prevention of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) because it was reported ECSOD relieved early-stage vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty mongrel dogs were divided randomly into 4 groups to serve as control, SAH, SAH+adenovirus ECSOD (AdECSOD), and SAH+no transgene (AdBglII) groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH was used by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna on day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed at day 0 and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical behavior, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ECSOD activity, CSF leukocyte count, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and human ECSOD expression (RT-PCR) in the basilar arteries were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe vasospasm was obtained in SAH, SAH+AdECSOD, and SAH+AdBglII gene-transferred dogs, and the residual diameters of the basilar artery were 41+/-1%, 39+/-4%, and 49+/-4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased CSF activity of ECSOD was obtained in SAH+AdECSOD (162+/-23 U/mL) when compared with SAH (26+/-2) and SAH+AdBglII (25+/-3) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR confirmed successful gene transfer in the basilar arteries from SAH+AdECSOD dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000218'>Increased leukocyte counts</z:mp> were observed in the CSF and in the subarachnoid space, especially in SAH+AdECSOD and SAH+AdBglII dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gene transfer of human ECSOD failed to prevent delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
