<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiologic mechanism responsible for this success has not previously been delineated in controlled experimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this investigation was to delineate the effects of cardiac output and of hemodilution in a primate model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of anesthetized rhesus monkeys received extensive cardiovascular monitoring, and local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was determined in both ischemic and nonischemic brain regions by the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were subjected to unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group then underwent blood volume expansion with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> (cardiac output augmentation), and one group underwent isovolemic hemodilution with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi>, cardiac output being maintained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in lCBF occurred in ischemic regions only and occurred only in response to augmentation of cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isovolemic hemodilution failed to produce any changes in lCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This investigation indicates that ischemic brain regions are selectively vulnerable to alterations in cardiac output, these effects being independent of alterations in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood viscosity changes may play only a minor role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study strongly suggests an important role of intravascular volume expansion and cardiac output augmentation in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
