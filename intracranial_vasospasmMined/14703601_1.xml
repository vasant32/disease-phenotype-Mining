<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The roles of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in a vasospasm caused by a SAH remain to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of an intracisternal administration of alphatochopherol on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was investigated in an experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed whether the administration of alphatochopherol reduced the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By means of an intracisternal blood injection model, a SAH was induced in 30 rats, which were randomly divided into three groups, as follows: group I (G1), without a SAH and drug, group II (G2), a SAH alone, group III (G3), a SAH and alphatochopherol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fresh unheparinized arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna to induce a SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In G3, 20 U (0.4ml) alphatochopherol was intracisternally injected forty-five hours after induction of the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were sacrificed 72 hours after the induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery, with surrounding tissue, was removed from the cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional diameter of the lumen and vessel wall of the rat basilar artery was assessed from a planimetric analysis, and changes compared with G1 and G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional diameter of the vessels exposed to subarachnoid blood was found to be 29.01 % (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The group treated with alphatochopherol had a 9% reduction (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation on a vasospasm caused by SAH is well known to be critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Data from the present study indicated that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapy, with topical alphatochopherol, may be promising on a vasospasm caused by a SAH </plain></SENT>
