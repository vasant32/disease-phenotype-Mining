<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains a major complication in patients who have suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) attenuates experimental SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, E2 has been shown to reduce neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and secondary injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor (AR-A1) expression is increased following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may represent an endogenous neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of E2 in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and reducing secondary injury, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and AR-A1 expression, following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH in rats was used, and the degree of vasospasm was determined by averaging the cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery 7 days after the first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> assay was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in the protein expression of AR-A1 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus were compared with levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and E2-treated groups (subcutaneous E2, 0.3 mg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The administration of E2 prevented vasospasm (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the first SAH, DNA fragmentation and protein levels of AR-A1 were significantly increased in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The E2 treatment decreased DNA fragmentation and prevented the increase in AR-A1 expression in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in DNA fragmentation and the expression of AR-A1 after SAH in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the animals in the control and E2-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The E2 was effective in attenuating SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the dentate gyrus, and reducing the expression of AR-A1 in the dentate gyrus after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, E2 appears to effectively prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> subsequent to SAH as well as attenuate secondary injury by reducing both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and a compensatory increase in AR-A1 expression in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
