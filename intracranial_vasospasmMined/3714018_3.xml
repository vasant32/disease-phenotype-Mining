<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By computed tomographic criteria and on early cerebrospinal fluid examination, no subarachnoid blood was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal appearance of vasospasm was consistent with that typically seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> and iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> occurred contralateral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (as determined by computed tomographic scanning) may still be at risk for developing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
