<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experiments were carried out in rabbits to determine whether clentiazem (8-chlorodiltiazem), a cerebrovascular-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, administered 24 hours before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> influenced the subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by multiple injections of blood into the prepontine cisterns of 35 male New Zealand White rabbits, and clentiazem (5 mg/kg) was administered 4 times daily until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral artery diameter was assessed in vivo by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional features of basilar arteries were measured using conventional in vitro methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clentiazem reduced the angiographic narrowing seen on days 2 and 5 from 35% and 34%, respectively (sham control, 1.42 +/- 0.31 mm [n = 22]), to 8% and 11%, respectively, and prevented the narrowing (32%) that occurred on day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Narrowing in the untreated rabbits was only partly reversed by papaverine; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> narrowing in clentiazem-treated animals was papaverine sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clentiazem prevented or reduced many of the changes in the basilar artery caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of particular relevance to arterial narrowing were the increased wall stiffness, the transient spontaneous changes in wall force, and the reduction in relaxation to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the changes in wall force induced by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and by stimulation of intramural sympathetic nerves was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vascular damage associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is related to calcium entry into the smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and possibly sympathetic nerve terminals, through calcium channels sensitive to clentiazem, which suggests that clentiazem may be of value in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
