<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injection of 5 ml of platelet-rich plasma (PRP; approximately 7.5 x 10(8) platelets) induced not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (1 h) but also <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (7 days) angiographically evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic perivascular nerves on cerebral arteries showed no remarkable change following repeated injections of PRP, as the dense distribution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-fluorescence and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive nerve fibers on Day 7 was comparable to findings in the preinjection controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While there were no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-immunoreactive fibers in the cerebral arteries of control animals, numerous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-immunoreactive fibers were present in the PRP-injected animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, presumably released from extravasated platelets, may be taken up by nerve endings and act as a vasoconstrictor transmitter in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
