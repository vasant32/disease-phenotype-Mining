<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory processes seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The C-reactive protein (CRP) constitutes a highly sensitive inflammatory marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of elevated systemic CRP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary vasospasm</z:e> has been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, elevation of the serum CRP levels has been demonstrated in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the possible relationship between elevated CRP levels in the serum and CSF and the development of vasospasm in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 41 adult patients in whom aSAH was diagnosed were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their demographics, the admitting Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, CT scans, digital subtraction angiography studies, and daily neurological examinations were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial serum and CSF CRP measurements were obtained on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent either surgical or endovascular treatment within 48 hours of their admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CRP levels in serum and CSF peaked on the 3rd postadmission day, and the CRP levels in CSF were always higher than the serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower admission GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades had statistically significantly higher levels of CRP in serum and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with angiographic vasospasm had higher CRP measurements in serum and CSF, in a statistically significant fashion (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients with higher CRP levels in serum and CSF had less favorable outcome in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aSAH who had high Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades and low GCS scores showed elevated CRP levels in their CSF and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients developing angiographically proven vasospasm demonstrated significantly elevated CRP levels in serum and CSF, and increased CRP measurements were strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in this cohort </plain></SENT>
