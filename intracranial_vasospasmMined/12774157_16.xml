<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the accuracy of transcranial Doppler to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a patient population with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective blind comparison of transcranial Doppler with cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy of transcranial Doppler was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and likelihood ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using directly measured middle cerebral artery diameter as reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Intensive Care Unit of a large university teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent angiography on admission and after 8 days to diagnose vasospasm and were defined as having clinical vasospasm, angiographic vasospasm, or no vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 1.00 and 0.75 for angiographic vasospasm and both equal to 1.00 for clinical vasospasm diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler mean velocity threshold value of 100 cm/s for angiographic vasospasm and 160 cm/s for clinical vasospasm detection were chosen by ROC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A Transcranial Doppler mean velocity threshold of 160 cm/s, calculated by the ROC analysis, accurately detects clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A daily transcranial Doppler examination performed by a trained operator should be routinely used to provide early identification of patients at high risk and to orient therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
