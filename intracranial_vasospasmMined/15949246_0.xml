<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: An established rabbit single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: non-treatment, sham control, lower-D(2)O, and higher-D(2)O treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed before (day 0) and after (day 2) SAH and the CVS ratio was calculated by comparing the diameter of the basilar artery (BA) on day 2 with that on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, blood clot volume was assessed and the BA was dissected from the brain for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CVS ratio in D(2)O-treatment groups was significantly higher in comparison with that in non-treatment and sham control groups (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the volume of blood clot around the BA was reduced significantly in D(2)O-treatment groups, compared with those in both the non-treatment and the sham control groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed that the BA represented less folding of the internal elastic lumina in D(2)O-treatment groups, while a corrugation of the intima with the thickened vessel wall was seen in both the non-treatment and sham control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therapeutic administration of D(2)O into the cisterna magna exhibited an inhibitory effect on CVS after SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
