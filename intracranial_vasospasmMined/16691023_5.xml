<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that inflammatory reactions could be involved in the pathogenesis of such delayed occurring ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules with regard to these lesions following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken daily from 15 patients up to day 9 after SAH and evaluated for intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF and serum samples correlated well during nearly the whole time course (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A secondary increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the serum and CSF correlated with an increase in flow velocity in the transcranial Doppler (p &gt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.007) but not to a delayed lesion in the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We believe that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> but they might only be a part of a multifactorial pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
