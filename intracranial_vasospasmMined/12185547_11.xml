<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report quantification of vasospasm following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and the effect of a new antivasospastic free radical scavenger (AVS) in rats, using an angiographic technique developed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We acquired single-exposure angiograms with mammographic equipment, using a 0.1 mm diameter focal spot and single-emulsion mammographic films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast medium was injected through a PE50 catheter in the common carotid artery, after the external carotid artery had been ligated to divert flow towards the internal carotid artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the M1 and A1 segments and of the middle third of the basilar artery were made by projecting the angiograms directly as slides and using the endovascular catheter as an internal reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the technique on 40 male <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> Sprague-Dawley rats divided into four groups: sham-operated+saline, SAH+saline, sham-operated+AVS and SAH+AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to measure the diameter of the principal intracranial arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With our technique, which is cost-effective when compared to many of those reported recently, we could detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated rats with SAH, and confirm antivasospastic effects of AVS </plain></SENT>
