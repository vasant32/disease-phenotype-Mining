<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1, the most potent vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of the endothelin family, is synthesized initially as a large prepropeptide that requires multiple steps of post-translational processing for activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final step of this processing involves the proteolytic cleavage of a relatively inactive precursor, big endothelin-1, by the metalloprotease endothelin-converting enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous findings have demonstrated that intravenous bolus injections of an endothelin-converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> (CGS 26303) administered twice daily can prevent and reverse arterial narrowing in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, attenuation of vasospastic response was incomplete and required relatively high doses to be effective in reversing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study evaluated an alternative protocol for administration of CGS 26303 to optimize the antispastic influence of this compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous intravenous infusion of CGS 26303 at doses of 2.4, 8.0, or 24.0 mg/kg/d was initiated either 1 hour (prevention paradigm) or 24 hours (reversal paradigm) after experimental SAH in New Zealand White rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed by perfusion-fixation 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were then removed and sectioned, and their cross-sectional areas were measured by use of computer-assisted video microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Continuous intravenous infusion of CGS 26303 attenuated SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a dose-dependent manner in both the prevention and the reversal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects achieved statistical significance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses as compared with the SAH-only or SAH-plus-vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the attenuation of vasospasm after continuous infusion of CGS 26303 was more efficacious than that obtained with bolus injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings provide further support for the use of endothelin-converting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> as a therapeutic strategy for reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and they also support the effectiveness of this strategy even when initiated after arterial narrowing has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings also indicate that continuous intravenous infusion of CGS 26303 is a more effective approach for attenuation of vasospasm than bolus intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
