<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on health-related quality of life after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An additional objective was to determine how the timing of nimodipine therapy can influence health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated between 1998 and 2008 for nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> were sent a standardized questionnaire for the purposes of documenting their health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially the patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (radiologically confirmed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were then differentiated according to four types of treatment options for vasospasm: 1) nimodipine since admission (N = 179); 2) nimodipine since diagnosis of vasospasm (N = 14); 3) no nimodipine/no vasospasm (N = 34); and 4) no nimodipine despite vasospasm (N = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance was established as P≤ 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluable questionnaires were returned by 236 patients (68% women, mean age 56.35 ± 12.68 years; 32% men, mean age 54.57 ± 12.20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life generally appeared to be impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Yet with the exception of the subscale (1 of 8) of physical role (P = 0.019), there were no differences between patients with and without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variations in the different treatment options revealed significant effects in terms of the component summaries and subscales: physical role and pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, mental health, and mental component summary (P≤ 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> had little influence on health-related quality of life in our patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life cannot be used as the only argument in favor of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with nimodipine </plain></SENT>
