<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As phosphodiesterase type V (PDE V) selectively hydrolyzes cGMP, we hypothesized that PDE V may function in the initiation of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study sought to identify the altered PDE V expression and activity in the vasospastic artery in a canine SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also used this system to examine possible therapeutic strategies to prevent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a canine model of SAH, we induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the basilar artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following angiographic confirmation of vasospasm on day 7, PDE V expression was immunohistochemically identified in smooth muscle cells of the vasospastic BA but not in cells of a control artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The isolation of PDE enzymes using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> column confirmed increased PDE V activity in the vasospastic artery only through both inhibition studies, using the highly selective PDE V inhibitor, sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>, and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preliminary in vivo experiment using an oral PDE V inhibitor at 0.83 mg kg(-1) demonstrated partial relaxation of the spastic BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PDE V activity was increased from control levels within the BA seven days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PDE V expression was most prominent in smooth muscle cells following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that clinical administration of a PDE V inhibitor may be a useful therapeutic tool in the prevention of vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
