<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms were performed on 15 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours later, 1 cc/kg of autologous blood was infused into the cisterna magna of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six rabbits received no treatment, six received U-74006F starting 30 minutes after SAH, and three rabbits received the vehicle for U-74006F starting 30 minutes after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours post-SAH, a second angiogram was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiographic techniques were used to measure the diameter of and contrast material flow through the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours post-SAH, vasospasm was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated and vehicle-treated rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diameter of and the flow through the basilar artery were significantly reduced 42.3% +/- 6.6% and 46.8% +/- 5.8%, respectively, below pre-SAH levels (means +/- standard error of the means) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with U-74006F eliminated the SAH-induced vasospasm; in treated animals, both the flow through and the diameter of the basilar arteries were at pre-SAH levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that: 1) membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> changes (that is, hydrolysis with eicosanoid production and/or peroxidation) contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm resulting from SAH, and 2) U-74006F prevents the SAH-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm in this model by limiting these pathological membrane events </plain></SENT>
