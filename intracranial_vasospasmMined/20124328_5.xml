<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> can attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), its effect on the secondary pathophysiological changes after SAH has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence demonstrates that SAH-induced microthrombosis plays important roles in the pathogenesis of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no study focused on the treatment of microthrombosis in SAH models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on microthrombi formation after SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult male SD rats were divided into four groups: (1) control group (n = 6); (2) SAH group (n = 6); (3) SAH+vehicle group (n = 6) and (4) SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 ml of fresh arterial, non-heparinized blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in 20 sec with a syringe pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was administered ip at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain samples were excised after perfusion fixation at 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional areas of the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microclots were evaluated by H&amp;E staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microthrombi formation was measured by fibrin(ogen) immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results showed that administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> prevented vasospasm on day 7 following SAH (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of microthrombi was significantly increased in both cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex at 7 days after SAH (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment down-regulated the formation of microclots in this SAH model and the number of microthombi was decreased significantly in the SAH+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group compared to the SAH or SAH+vehicle groups (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> administration attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and alleviates microthrombosis in the late phase of SAH in this prechiasmatic blood injection model </plain></SENT>
