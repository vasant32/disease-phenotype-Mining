<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: since October 1999, nicardipine pellets (NP) have been used to prevent vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We started a multicenter cooperative study on Jan 1, 2007, and 136 patients in six hospitals were enrolled to this trial in 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and outcome were examined in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the patients with SAH were treated with NP during surgery after clipping of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: the study included 87 female patients, 38 over 70 years old, 34 in grades 4 and 5, and 46 of Fisher group 2 or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> were located on anterior circulation in 133, posterior in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with Fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> except for 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two to twelve pellets were implanted in the cistern where thick clots existed and vasospasm was highly likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND), angiographical vasospasm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were seen in 11 of 134 (8.2%), 32 of 130 patients (24.6%), and 16 of 129 (12.4%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complications were experienced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent rate at 3 months was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this multicenter trial is similar to that of our first trial performed in a single center </plain></SENT>
