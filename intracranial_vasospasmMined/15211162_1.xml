<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five consecutive patients scheduled for selective craniotomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> in oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radial arterial catheter was inserted for blood sampling before anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial plasma concentrations of ET and CGRP were measured with radioimmunoassay prior to induction, after dura incision, after clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 30 minutes after clipping the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of ET decreased significantly during the anesthesia and surgery compared with the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An observed decrease in mean CGRP during anesthesia and surgery was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the well-recognized vasoconstrictive effect of ET, it is possible that a decrease in its plasma concentration plays a role in the prevention of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia in patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
