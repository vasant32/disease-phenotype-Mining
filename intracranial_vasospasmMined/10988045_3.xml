<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the correlation between angiographic cerebral circulation time (CCT) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) evaluated by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after endovascular treatment for symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with unilateral vasospasm as demonstrated by catheter angiography who underwent pre- and post-treatment SPECT were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had angiographic vasospasm of unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight vessels in seven patients underwent intra-arterial papaverine infusion and three vessels underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic CCT was defined as the interval from the first image in which contrast medium was visible at the origin of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> to its disappearance from the cortical arteries in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SPECT studies, the ischaemic degree in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory was analysed by side to side comparison with calculating the asymmetry index (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pre-treatment mean CCT was 4.1 +/- 0.8 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CCT immediately after treatment was 2.7 +/- 0.5 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects (n = 15) with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, mean CCT was 3.5 +/- 0.2 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pre-treatment mean CCT was significantly prolonged compared with that in the control subjects (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post-treatment mean CCT was significantly shortened compared with that in the control subjects (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pre-treatment mean AI was 71.2 +/- 7.4%, and that immediately after treatment was 90.5 +/- 3.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AI increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> territories treated with endovascular treatment; the mean change was 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Angiographic CCT was closely correlated with AI in both pre- (r = - 0.95) and post-treatment (r = - 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of CCT is useful in evaluating cerebral haemodynamics of endovascular treatments in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
