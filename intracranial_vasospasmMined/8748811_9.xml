<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed clinically and with serial TCD investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing nimodipine to high-dose treatment led to a reduction of the abnormally elevated mean flow velocities (FV) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also a reversal of clinical signs of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, repeated computer tomographic (CT) investigations revealed a reversal of ischaemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of nimodipine from 4 to 2 mg/hr resulted in a return to abnormally elevated mean FV as well as a return of clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favourable in 82% of the patients and there was no mortality or vegetative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient deteriorated clinically due to vasospasm during treatment with high-dose nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The individual effect of nimodipine treatment can be monitored by the use of serial TCD investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD-guided high-dose nimodipine treatment appears to be an effective treatment in SAH patients developing vasospasm despite prophylactic standard dose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data give support for a direct vascular effect of nimodipine on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
