<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 release was significantly suppressed by Y-27632 and fasudil, Rho-kinase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although IkappaB inhibitor suppressed the TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 release, the Rho-kinase inhibitors did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha induced the phosphorylation of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p44/p42 MAP kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 release was suppressed by SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or SP600125, a SAPK/JNK inhibitor, but not by PD98059, a MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of both p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rho-kinase, which has been used for the clinical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e>, may be involved in other central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disorders such as traumatic injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo> and neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine that affects the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> through cytokines, such as IL-6, release from neurons, astrocytes and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the involvement of Rho-kinase in the TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 release from rat C6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that Rho-kinase regulates the TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 release at a point upstream from p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK in C6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Rho-kinase inhibitor may be considered to be a new clinical candidate for the treatment of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
