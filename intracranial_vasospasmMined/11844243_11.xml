<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endothelin (ET) has, since its discovery, increasingly been considered a key player in the pathophysiological processes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, although it remains unclear how ET is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present data that indicate an inherent capacity of human cerebral arteries to change their sensitivity to ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human cerebral arteries were obtained from patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vessels were divided into segments and subjected to organ culture for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vessels were then examined by using in vitro pharmacological methods and molecular biological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After organ culture of the cerebral arteries, both the sensitivity to and potency of ET were enhanced (maximal response, 152 +/- 9%; -log (50% effective concentration), 10.3 +/- 0.3), in comparison with data for fresh cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contractions were inhibited by both FR139317 (a specific ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> (a mixed ET(A) and ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), in a manner indicating the sole presence of contractile ET(A) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inconsistent dilative response to the selective ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> sarafotoxin 6c was observed; the response was preserved in some segments and abolished in others, and potentiation of the precontraction was observed in yet other segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No isolated contractile response to sarafotoxin 6c was observed, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays, both ET(A) and ET(B) receptor messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that human cerebral arteries are capable of enhancing the function of ET(A) receptors </plain></SENT>
