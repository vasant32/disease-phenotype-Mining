<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The early and urgent ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> microsurgery principle is being presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Bosnia, this principle was pioneered by author (KD) as a part of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this strategy was to prevent the rehemorrhage which mortality rate is up to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND RESULTS: A one-year (April 2003-April 2004) prospective study of 24 no selected patients with 33 anterior and posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were operated on early (42%) and urgently (58%) regardless of their Hunt-Hess grade, age and vasospasm, but also localization, size and number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty four ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent the clip occlusion (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 (91%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were clipped with only one intraoperative rupture (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate for anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> regardless of HH grade was 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with HH gr I and II had excellent outcome (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate of patients with HH gr III harboring anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 7.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with HH gr IV and V died in 50% of cases despite surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> increased mortality rate of operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be occluded immediately although the operative outcome of early and urgent surgery is worse than late surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Especially urgent surgery has bad outcome because it is mainly performed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But the overall outcome is the worst after utilizing the principle of late surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In one month period of time, no operated patients have 50% of chance to experience rehemorrhage (80% mortality rate), 36% of chance to develop symptomatic vasospasm with 7-15% mortality, and 20-50% possibility of occurring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>According to recent studies, the overall mortality rate of untreated patients with aneurysmal SAH is over 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mortality of surgically and conservatively treated patients is 20-30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of patients with HH gr IV and V who are exclusively treated by conservative therapy is only 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early and urgent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> microsurgery resulted in outcome improvement of operated patients up to 30% compared with expected outcome of patients without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The justification for early and urgent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery was found in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups, HH gr I&amp;II patients had benefit in 23-30% of cases, HH gr IV&amp;V had benefit in 20-40% and HH gr III with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had benefit in 15-20% of cases </plain></SENT>
