<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were treated with 21 trials of intravenous aminophylline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After angiographic demonstration of spasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were started on a continuous intravenous infusion of aminophylline 125 mg/hr and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> 125 micrograms/hr, preferably for a period of at least five days before the medications were tapered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 treatment trials, there were 11 definite beneficial responses and ten failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the importance of instituting this therapy as rapidly as possible following the confirmation of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, if a response occurs it will be noted within 24 hours of institution of the medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If no response is noted following this time period, the medications should be discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major complications of this therapy include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and arrythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These complications may necessitate diminishing the dosage of the medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, if a response has been obtained, every effort should be made to avoid discontinuing therapy prematurely since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may recur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> and aminophylline is based on their demonstrated ability to increase cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) levels in vascular smooth muscle, thus producing relaxation of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
