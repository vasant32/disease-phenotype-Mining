<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the effects of Mg2+ on in vitro vasospasm using CSF from vasospastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients with vasospasm (CSFv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oxygen consumption and isometric force measurements in the porcine carotid artery were used to assess the contractile and metabolic status of the vessels' responses to CSFv and the effect of Mg2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mg2+ caused a dose dependant decrease in tension following contraction by CSFv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mg2+ (12 mM) caused a normalization of relaxation rate in tissue exposed to CSFv, caused a significant decrease in basal oxygen consumption, as well as significantly decreasing the rate of oxygen consumption of the porcine carotid artery when stimulated by CSF (0.70 +/- 0.12 versus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Mg2+ addition demonstrated the most effective protection using an assay based on CSFv contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Mg2+ can protect vascular smooth muscle exposed to CSFv by benefiting contractile behaviour and metabolism of the arteries </plain></SENT>
