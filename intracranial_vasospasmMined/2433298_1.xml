<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombin (1 and 10 U/ml) reduced basal tone and significantly inhibited the contractions elicited by K+, PGF2 alpha, and plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relaxant effect of thrombin was abolished by procedures that destroy endothelium and by exposing the artery to thrombin for prolonged periods (tachyphylaxis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AT III (1-6 U/ml) reduced basal tone and significantly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the contractile responses to K+, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp>, PGF2 alpha, and plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast to thrombin, AT III did not induce tachyphylaxis nor was its vasorelaxant effect significantly reduced by destruction of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
