<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve were operated on within 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), prior to the occurrence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, CSF was continuously drained from a basal cistern or lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> was assayed by the highly sensitive automated fluorometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of NE increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites of CSF sampling along with the appearance of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the cisternal CSF of patients with vasospasm contained significantly higher NE (0.246 +/- 0.049 ng/ml, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) compared to those without vasospasm (0.075 +/- 0.001 ng/ml) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, since this increase cannot be considered to be high enough locally to constrict cerebral arteries, this might be only a secondary phenomenon due to release of NE into CSF from various sources in the brain </plain></SENT>
