<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>THE TECHNOLOGY: Endovascular coil embolization is a percutaneous approach to treat an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> from within the blood vessel without the need of a craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this procedure, a microcatheter is inserted into the femoral artery near the groin and navigated to the site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small helical <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils are deployed through the microcatheter to fill the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and prevent it from further expansion and rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Health Canada has approved numerous types of coils and coil delivery systems to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> may occur in any blood vessel of the brain; however, they are most commonly found at the branch points of large arteries that form the circle of Willis at the base of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 85% to 95% of patients, they are found in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation are less frequent, and are more difficult to treat surgically due to inaccessibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are small and asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may have a mass effect, causing compression on the brain and cranial nerves and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptures and bleeds, resulting in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), the mortality rate can be 40% to 50%, with severe morbidity of 10% to 20% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Open surgical clipping, involves craniotomy, brain retraction, and placement of a silver clip across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> while a patient is under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This procedure is associated with surgical risks and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Endovascular coil embolization, introduced in the 1990s, is the health technology under review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>LITERATURE REVIEW: METHODS: The Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the International Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) Database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant systematic reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>OVID Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Embase were searched for English-language journal articles that reported primary data on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, obtained in a clinical setting or analyses of primary data maintained in registers or institutional databases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS: Coil embolization appears to be a safe procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Complications associated with coil embolization ranged from 8.6% to 18.6% with a median of about 10.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Observational studies showed that coil embolization is associated with lower complication rates than surgical clipping (permanent complication 3-7% versus 10.9%; overall 23% versus 46% respectively, p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Common complications of coil embolization are thrombo-embolic events (2.5%-14.5%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (2.3%-4.7%), parent artery obstruction (2%-3%), collapsed coils (8%), coil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> (14.6%), and coil migration (0.5%-3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials showed that for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> with SAH, suitable for both coil embolization and surgical clipping (mostly saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> &lt;10 mm in diameter located in the anterior circulation) in people with good clinical condition:Coil embolization resulted in a statistically significant 23.9% relative risk reduction and 7% absolute risk reduction in the composite rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and dependency compared to surgical clipping (modified Rankin score 3-6) at 1-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The advantage of coil embolization over surgical clipping varies widely with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, but endovascular treatment seems beneficial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There were less <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the first 7 years following coil embolization compared to surgical clipping (10.8% vs 13.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This survival benefit seemed to be consistent over time, and was statistically significant (log-rank p= 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization is associated with less frequent MRI-detected superficial brain deficits and ischemic lesions at 1-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The 1- year rebleeding rate was 2.4% after coil embolization and 1% for surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Confirmed rebleeding from the repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after the first year and up to year eight was low and not significantly different between coil embolization and surgical clipping (7 patients for coil embolization vs 2 patients for surgical clipping, log-rank p=0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Observational studies showed that patients with SAH and good clinical grade had better 6-month outcomes and lower risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after coil embolization compared to surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>For unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, there were no randomized controlled trials that compared coil embolization to surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Large observational studies showed that: The risk of rupture in unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> less than 10 mm in diameter is about 0.05% per year for patients with no pervious history of SAH from another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The risk of rupture increases with history of SAH and as the diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reaches 10 mm or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization reduced the composite rate of in hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and discharge to long-term or short-term care facilities compared to surgical clipping (Odds Ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The improvement in discharge disposition was highest in people older than 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality rate following treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> ranged from 0.5% to 1.7% for coil embolization and from 2.1% to 3.5% for surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The overall 1-year mortality rate was 3.1% for coil embolization and 2.3% for surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>One-year morbidity rate was 6.4% for coil embolization and 9.8% for surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether these differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization is associated with shorter hospital stay compared to surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>For both ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, the outcome of coil embolization does not appear to be dependent on age, whereas surgical clipping has been shown to yield worse outcome for patients older than 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>ANGIOGRAPHIC EFFICIENCY AND RECURRENCES: The main drawback of coil embolization is its low angiographic efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The percentage of complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion after coil embolization (27%-79%, median 55%) remains lower than that achieved with surgical clipping (82%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>However, about 90% of coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> achieve near total occlusion or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Incompletely coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been shown to have higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence rates ranging from 7% to 39% for coil embolization compared to 2.9% for surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Recurrence is defined as refilling of the neck, sac, or dome of a successfully treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as shown on an angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The long-term clinical significance of incomplete occlusion following coil embolization is unknown, but in one case series, 20% of patients had major recurrences, and 50% of these required further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: A large international randomized trial reported that the survival benefit from coil embolization was sustained for at least 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The rebleeding rate between year 2 and year 8 following coil embolization was low and not significantly different from that of surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>However, high quality long-term angiographic evidence is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, there is uncertainty about long-term occlusion status, coil durability, and recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>While surgical clipping is associated with higher immediate procedural risks, its long-term effectiveness has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS: Coil embolization offers treatment for people at increased risk for craniotomy, such as those over 65 years of age, with poor clinical status, or with comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
