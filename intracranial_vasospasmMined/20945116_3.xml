<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e> (NSM) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is well described, its clinical significance remains poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, serious cardiovascular events, and functional outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 481 patients enrolled in the University Columbia SAH Outcomes Project between 10/96 and 05/02, we analyzed a subset of 119 patients with at least one echocardiogram, serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) data, and with no prior history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LV dysfunction was defined as an ejection fraction &lt;40% on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarction from vasospasm was adjudicated by the study team after comprehensive review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed at 15 and 90 days with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients had LV dysfunction (N = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Younger age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and complete filling of the quadrigeminal and fourth ventricles were associated with LV dysfunction (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar frequency of pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 0% of patients with LV dysfunction reported taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, compared to 35% of those without (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between LV dysfunction and infarction from vasospasm after adjusting for clinical grade, age, and peak TCD flow velocity (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with LV dysfunction also had higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> requiring vasopressors (P = 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between LV dysfunction and outcome at 14 days after adjustment for established prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LV dysfunction after SAH increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> from vasospasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, but with aggressive ICU support does not affect short-term survival or functional outcome </plain></SENT>
