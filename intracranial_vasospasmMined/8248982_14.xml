<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it has been suggested that humoral immunity plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, there has been no quantitative assay for cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the kinetics of immune cells in the subarachnoid space after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fourteen Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into two groups and injected with either autologous blood (0.3 mL) or saline into the major cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were killed at the specified time: 10 minutes or 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For immunohistochemical analysis, the rats' whole brains were frozen, and cryostat sections were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For flow cytometric analysis of immune cell presence, their whole brains underwent enzymatic digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathologic study revealed pathological change of the arterial wall, and immunohistochemical study revealed the existence of macrophages and T cells in the subarachnoid space in animals with a survival time of 2 to 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A flow cytometric study revealed the peak of appearance of T cells and macrophages 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The helper-suppressor T cell ratio also reached a peak 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A serial response of immunoreactive cells, which resembles that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> allergic reaction observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp>, exists in the subarachnoid space after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the initial response in cellular immunity, which is followed by humoral immunity and eicosanoid reactions, plays a role in eliciting the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
