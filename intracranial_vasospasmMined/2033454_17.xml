<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin immunoreactivity was overexpressed in the endothelium of the vasospastic basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because endothelin synthesis is regulated at the messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> transcription level, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor, was studied as a means of preventing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> for 5 days beginning on the day of SAH completely inhibited the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This novel experimental therapy may lead not only to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> but also to the availability of a prophylactic adjuvant therapy for patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
