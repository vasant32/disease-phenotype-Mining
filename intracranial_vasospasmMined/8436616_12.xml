<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PKC activation by intracisternal injection of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (TP)] induced dose-dependent, slowly developing, severe contraction of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single intracisternal injection of TP (5 x 10(-9) M in the CSF) induced sustained contraction lasting over 3 days, which almost paralleled the changes of membrane-bound PKC activity in the basilar arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model, membrane-bound PKC activity in the basilar artery increased up to day 4 and returned to the control level by day 14, whereas angiographic contraction reached a maximum on day 7 and still persisted at a moderate level on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, there was a discrepancy between arterial PKC activity and arterial contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple intracisternal injections of TP produced 30-40% sustained contraction of the basilar artery lasting for more than 10 days along with sustained activation of PKC to levels compatible with that observed in the SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, TP injection caused considerably milder histological changes in the basilar artery than those noted in the SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH cannot be explained solely on the basis of activation of the PKC pathway </plain></SENT>
