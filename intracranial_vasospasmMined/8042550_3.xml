<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 animals of either sex, weighing 7 to 12 kg, were assigned into saline control and Nicorandil-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the second induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), animals started to receive the agent via the venous route at the constant rate of 10 micrograms/kg/minute for six hours (day 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On days 4, 5, and 6, the drug was given twice at the same rate for three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the final angiograms, animals were sacrificed by exsanguination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using ring specimen of the canine basilar artery at a resting tension of 3 g, isometric tension was monitored to examine the effect of Nicorandil on <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil significantly ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm and inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>-induced contraction in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that Nicorandil provides a useful way of treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
