<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the morphological and biochemical properties of actomyosin from bovine cerebral arteries were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arrays of thick and thin filaments were clearly seen on electron micrographs of a cross section of a muscle strip stretched to 1.5 times its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> length in Krebs-Ringer solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameters of the thick and thin filaments were 110.0 +/- 19.9 A and 51.0 +/- 8.0 A, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average ratio of thick to thin filaments was about 1:15 to 1:16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gel pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-sensitive actomyosin extracted from bovine cerebral arteries revealed the presence of myosin, actin, and tropomyosin, but not skeletal troponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Mg-ATPase activity of actomyosin was greatly enhanced in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid superprecipitation occurred after the clearing phase, when 1 mM Mg-ATP was added to a suspension of actomyosin with 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This superprecipitation did not occur with a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration of 10(-8) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracellular free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> appears to play a crucial role in the regulation of contraction and relaxation of cerebral arterial smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
