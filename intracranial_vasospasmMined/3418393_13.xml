<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> breakdown product with detergent-like activity, accrued in incubated blood or in intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and whether topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> altered the caliber or <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a model of blood residing in the subarachnoid space, <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> vials of cat blood and of human blood were incubated in vitro at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in the supernatant of cat blood increased from a value of 0.27 +/- 0.3 mg% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) on Day 0 to a value of 9.57 +/- 2.4 mg% on Day 10; the respective values for human blood were 0.53 +/- 0.02 mg% and 13.4 +/- 5.4 mg% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> that had been surgically removed from three patients between 4 and 11 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> yielded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels from 2.1 to 15.2 mg% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> suspension of 5, 10, or 20 mg% in buffered Ringer's solution to cat basilar artery in vivo led to progressive and sustained constriction; at 4 hours the mean decrease in the width of the blood column was 34% +/- 2.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of these vessels showed widespread pathological changes similar to those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of a 10-mg% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> suspension to the basilar artery of two baboons produced similar alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimal changes in diameter or <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were observed in cat arteries bathed in buffer solution alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings in animal models indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may play a central role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
