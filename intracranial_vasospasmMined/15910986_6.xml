<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The monohydroxylated metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi>), is a potent vasoconstrictor of cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> formation is substantially elevated in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> in human CSF has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to determine if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> metabolites are present in human CSF after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF samples were collected daily from four SAH patients over 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> metabolites were separated by HPLC with identification by ion-trap MS/MS and quantification via single quadrupole MS operating in negative single ion monitoring mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two major metabolites were identified as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> maximal concentrations were 2.9 and 0.7 ng/ml at approximately 70 h in the two patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (SV) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> in these patients peaked at 21.9 ng/ml and 2.8 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> were non-detectible in the majority of the samples obtained from two matched SAH patients without SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> are present in the CSF of SAH patients at physiologically relevant concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on this information future prospective studies will allow for the delineation of the role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of SAH </plain></SENT>
