<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SAH induces a decrease in cerebral blood flow of about 25% and a corresponding increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake of between 30% and 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In about half of the animals low-flow areas were noted in the cortex and the basal ganglia with a corresponding marked increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesioning of the A2-nucleus, its ascending pathway or the median eminence prevents the occurrence of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, treatment with a substance P <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or gammaglobulin against substance P prevents or significantly reduces the degree of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A unilateral post-ganglionic trigeminal lesion causes an ipsilateral constriction of the cerebral arteries of 27%, while a preganglionic lesion does not affect the baseline diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A pre- or post-ganglionic trigeminal lesion induces an increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake globally of about 50% without influencing cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following SAH the decrease in blood flow in both groups of lesioned animals is similar to that seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After SAH there is no further change in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in the animals with a preganglionic lesion, while in the post-ganglionically lesioned animals there is an additional increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake of about 50% as compared to controls or the animals with a preganglionic lesion </plain></SENT>
