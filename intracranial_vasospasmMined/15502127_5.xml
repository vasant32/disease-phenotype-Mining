<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of multisection CT angiography (MCTA) in the detection and quantification of vertebrobasilar vasospasm (VBS) indicated on transcranial Doppler (TCD) imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three MCTA studies of the vertebrobasilar arteries were performed with a multisection spiral CT scanner in 36 patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters used were 1-mm collimation, 0.625Q pitch, 120 kV, and 250 mAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast material was injected (80-100 mL, 3 mL/s) after a 15-20-second delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocessing of the vertebrobasilar system was performed by using maximum intensity projection and volume-rendering reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter was measured at different intracranial locations along the vertebral and basilar arteries perpendicular to their long axis by using curved reformatted multiplanar reformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD imaging of the posterior circulation was performed within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCTA demonstrated narrowed arteries compatible with VBS in 13 patients, consistent with TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite TCD recordings of high flow velocity in three other patients, MCTA did not reveal vasospasm but did show wide arteries feeding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> in two and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized arteries in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VBS in two patients was identified on MCTA but overlooked during TCD imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings on both TCD and MCTA studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral MCTA is recommended as a reliable, rapid, and minimally invasive diagnostic method, one complementary to TCD imaging for assessing VBS in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
