<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' neurologic grade on admission, hospital course, presence of vasospasm, level of consciousness, computed tomographic and angiographic findings, and outcome were compared with the concentrations of the above substances in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha correlated highly with development of and fluctuations in clinical vasospasm, with angiographic findings, with neurologic grade on admission, and with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha may be involved in delayed clinical vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
