<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An intracisternal injection of 5 ml of washed red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm of the basilar artery as seen by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was comparable with the degree of vasospasm induced by an injection of the same amount of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated injections of blood components or whole blood on Days 1 and 3 induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm, as shown by angiography on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results clearly indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm was produced by RBCs and PRP, and it was in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of RBCs (hematocrit: 30, 50, and 70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm induced by both components closely reproduced that seen with whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm induced by blood component injection was associated with clot formation in the subarachnoid space, as confirmed by an autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the extravasation of RBCs and PRP into the subarachnoid space produces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by mechanisms independent of blood clot formation </plain></SENT>
