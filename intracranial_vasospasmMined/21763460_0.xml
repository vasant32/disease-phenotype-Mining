<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relaxation effect of FM was studied using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) model in vivo and isolated aortic rings in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FM (0.35, 1.2, 3.5mg·kg(-1)) increased cerebrovascular flow (CVF) and femoral blood flow (FBF) dose-dependently in vivo, however, the relaxation effects of FM on cerebral vessels were much stronger than on peripheral vessels; FM showed dose-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings contracted by Methoxamine (Met) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relaxation IC(50) of FM and Prasozin (Pra) to the rabbit aortic rings contracted by Met are 27.54μM and 0.01μM respectively, and the relaxation IC(50) of FM to the rabbit and rat aortic rings contracted by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> are 37.15μM and 0.74μM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is no obvious difference between endothelium-intact and endothelium-removal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Met dose-effect relationship curve was significantly shifted to right by FM (0.3, 3μM), and E(max) was decreased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relaxation effect of FM on cerebral vessels was much stronger than on peripheral vessels in vivo, and the action is in an endothelium-independent manner </plain></SENT>
