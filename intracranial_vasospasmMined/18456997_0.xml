<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In arteries from healthy animals, these pressure-induced constrictions arise from depolarization of arterial smooth muscle leading to enhanced activity of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have observed that pressure-induced constrictions are greatly enhanced in cerebral arteries obtained from a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) due to the emergence of R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels in arterial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhanced pressure-induced constrictions and the resulting decrease in cerebral blood may contribute to the development of neurological deficits in SAH patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work supports the concept that small diameter arteries represent important targets for current treatment modalities (e.g. Hypertensive, Hypervolemic, Hemodilution "triple H" therapy) used in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we propose targeting R-type calcium channels, encoded by the gene Ca(v)2.3, as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
