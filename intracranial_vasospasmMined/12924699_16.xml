<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between cocaine use and outcomes of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the medical records of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated at a single institution between January 1996 and December 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only patients who presented with SAH were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The covariates chosen for the statistical analysis included the following: patient age, sex, and race; systolic and mean arterial blood pressure measurements on hospital admission; Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades; pre-existent major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>; and history of alcohol, tobacco, or cocaine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to standardize outcome and was dichotomized such that a score between 1 and 3 was considered a poor outcome and a score of 4 or 5 was considered a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The records of 151 patients were reviewed and 108 of these presented with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 108 patients, 36 (33.3%) had used cocaine within 24 hours before presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Hunt and Hess grade of IV or V was assigned to 20 (55.6%) of 36 patients who used cocaine, compared with eight (11.1%) of 72 patients who did not; this difference was found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (77.8%) in the cocaine user group and 20 patients (27.8%) in the non-cocaine user group experienced clinically significant, angiographically confirmed vasospasm during their hospital course (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use was associated with a 2.8-fold greater risk of developing vasospasm (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86-4.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A GOS score of 1, 2, or 3 was assigned to 33 patients (91.7%) in the cocaine user group and to 20 patients (27.8%) in the non-cocaine user group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use was associated with a 3.3-fold greater risk of poor outcome (95% CI 2.24-4.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association was found to be independent of Hunt and Hess grade as well as of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine adversely affects both the presentation of and outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH who are undergoing treatment for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The vasoactive properties of the drug appear to aggravate the already tenuous situation of SAH and increase both the occurrence and influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrates that cocaine directly affects both presentation and outcome in a significant manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is the authors' interpretation of the results of this retrospective review that cocaine use negatively affects outcome to such an extent that it should be considered equal to the presence of a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> when determining Hunt and Hess grade </plain></SENT>
