<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the subarachnoid blood was not detected or was distributed diffusely, severe vasospasm was almost never encounters (1 of 18 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of subarachnoid blood clots larger than 5 X 3 mm (measured on the reproduced images) or layers of blood 1 mm or more thick in fissures and vertical cisterns, severe spasm followed almost invariably (23 of 24 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was an almost exact correspondence between the site of the major subarachnoid blood clots and the location of severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every patient with severe vasospasm manifested delayed symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excellent correlation existed between the particular artery in vasospasm and the delayed clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm involved the anterior cerebral artery in 20 cases and the middle cerebral artery in only 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the grading system used is partly subjective, the findings should be regarded as preliminary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results, if confirmed, indicate that blood localized in the subarachnoid space in sufficient amount at specific sites is the only important etiological factor in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be possible to identify patients in jeopardy from vasospasm and institute early preventive measures </plain></SENT>
