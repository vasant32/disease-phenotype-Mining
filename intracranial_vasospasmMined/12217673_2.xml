<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, any promising finding in the laboratory deserves assessment in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the possible effects of trapidil on the basilar artery of the rabbit through a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This experimental study was carried out on 26 adult New Zealand <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rabbits of both sexes weighing 2.5-3.0 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transclival exposure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was produced by an intracisternal injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After observation of the vasospasm, trapidil was locally applied in increasing concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of each concentration was measured independently after 10 minutes for each application and was extended to three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trapidil was shown to have a clear spasmolytic effect on the rabbit's basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that trapidil can have a potential use in the treatment of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
