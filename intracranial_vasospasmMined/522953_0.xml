<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report describes the analysis of 216 CT pictures of 85 patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which consist of 29 anterior communicating, 27 internal carotid, 27 middle cerebral and 2 basilar arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, including 18 cases with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intervals between CT scanning and the last <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were various from 6 hours to 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first CT scanning was made in 40 cases within 3 days, in 54 cases within 7 days and in 11 cases more than one month after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT findings showed no abnormality in 9 patients who were classified as Grade I (Hunt and Kosnik) and examined more than 2 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients had some abnormal findings in the first CT scans, which were 55 cases of subarachnoid clot, 16 cases of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, 24 cases of intraventricular clot, 16 cases of low density suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> or softening and 42 cases of ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between CT findings and clinical grade of Hunt and Kosnik </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Grade I and II, abnormal findings other than subarachnoid clot were seldom seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iin Grade III, there were intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (20%), low density (20%) and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>; in Grade IV, massive intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (80%); in Grade V, massive intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and ventricular tamponade with blood clot; in Grade Ia, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> and/or diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> could be anticipated by CT pictures because it occurred frequently in the patients with massive and long-standing subarachnoid blood clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The determination of the side and location of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was possible in 82% of the patients who had subarachnoid clot, intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> or low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is useful to decide the side of the first angiography and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to be approached at first in the cases of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
