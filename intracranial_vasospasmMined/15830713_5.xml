<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following SAH, blood or its lysate enters the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined how blood lysate influences the vulnerable brain following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heparinized hemolysate was slowly injected into the cisterna magna of 10 female rabbits, while a control group of 10 rabbits received a similar injection of heparinized isotonic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> solution without hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery and brain tissue were excised after perfusion fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by measuring the cross-sectional area of the basilar artery, and brain damage was investigated by TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index of neuronal cells located at the base of the temporal lobe averaged 26% (range = 3 to 56%), which was significantly higher than the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index in the control group (mean 0.5%, range = 0 to 4%, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean cross-sectional area of the basilar artery in the SAH group did not differ significantly from that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SAH induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuronal cells by a mechanism that is independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
