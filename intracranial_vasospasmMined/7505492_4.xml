<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may result partially from the imbalance between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and vasoconstrictor factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> substance P and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> contained in the trigeminovascular system are involved in the vasomotor phenomenon occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The delayed arterial narrowing may reflect the time course of the release of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we followed the time course of the changes in cerebrospinal fluid immunoreactivity of substance P and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in a model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken in the basal state and at 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 3 days after a single injection of 1 mL autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of rabbits using a percutaneous suboccipital route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substance P-like and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-like immunoreactivities were determined in centrifuged cerebrospinal fluid and plasma by use of enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early (30 minutes) after induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, there was a large increase in cerebrospinal fluid substance P-like immunoreactivity (P &lt; .01) and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-like immunoreactivity (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial and hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid levels of substance P-like immunoreactivity were different (P &lt; .03), indicating that the increased cerebrospinal fluid level did not result only from the blood contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the immunoreactivities of substance P and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> remained significantly higher than the basal level (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At day 3, both immunoreactivities had decreased to a level nonsignificantly different from the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early high values of the cerebrospinal fluid immunoreactivities for substance P and calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, apart from the contamination by arterial blood, probably resulted from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from the trigeminovascular fibers </plain></SENT>
