<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was produced by a topical application of blood, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E2 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> to be exposed basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical PBZ caused a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the basilar artery and the occurrence of vasospasm was completely prevented either with blood, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of PBZ in the dosage with which the pressor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was completely blocked, or three times that dosage, failed to show any preventive effect on the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these experimental results, it seems that the antispasmogenic action of topically applied PBZ is due largely to the non-spacific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> action of PBZ and not to its alpha adrenergic blocking action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also suggested that the role of alpha adrenergic mechanism in the genesis of vasospasm in this experimental design is not significant </plain></SENT>
