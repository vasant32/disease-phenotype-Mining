<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) may present as thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (TCH), accompanied by reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and focal neurological deficits, often without a clear precipitant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCVS may be mistaken for Primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>Angiitis</z:mp> of the Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> System (PACNS) due to the presence of similar angiographic features of segmental narrowing of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss the clinical features of a young female <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patient who developed TCH and was found to have RCVS following initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for PACNS, in the context of a systematic review of the available medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Medline search was performed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case reports since 1966 describing RCVS and PACNS that provide sufficient clinical detail to permit diagnostic classification according to published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RCVS included case studies in which there was angiographic or transcranial Doppler ultrasound evidence of near-to-complete resolution of cerebral vasoconstriction in the absence of a well-recognized secondary cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PACNS included reports of histologically confirmed PACNS either through biopsy or necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome occurs primarily in females and is characterized by sudden, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF analysis, vasoconstriction involving the Circle of Willis and its immediate branches, and angiographic or TCD ultrasound evidence of near-to-complete vasospastic resolution within 1-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It occurs typically in the context of vasoconstrictive drug use, the peripartum period, bathing, and physical exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial and follow-up (within 4 weeks) non-invasive angiographic studies are indicated in patients who present with TCH or who have clinical presentations that could be consistent with RCVS or PACNS in the absence of a well-recognized secondary cause, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early reversibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is the key neuroradiological feature that supports the clinical diagnosis of RCVS </plain></SENT>
