<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the complications in two forms of angiogram-negative spontaneous SAH: pretruncal (PNSAH) and nonpretruncal (NPNSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group involved 18 patients with PNSAH and 16 patients with NPNSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan was done within 72 hours from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent four-vessel cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography was performed in five PNSAH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NPNSAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were in grade I or II of the Hunt-Hess Scale (17 PNSAH and 12 NPNSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one case of rebleeding (NPNSAH patient), 10 cases of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (4 PNSAH and 6 NPNSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> visualized by angiographies in two NPNSAH patients was local and mild, but was not found in PNSAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> electrocardiography changes were found in 19 patients (significantly more frequently in NPNSAH than in PNSAH, 12 and 7 patients, respectively; p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac problems following these types of SAH are more frequent than expected, and therefore cardiac monitoring is necessary </plain></SENT>
