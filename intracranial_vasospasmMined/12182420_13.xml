<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trapidil is currently used as a coronary artery vasodilating agent and is also used for the prevention of ischemic symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of trapidil on I/R injury and the ischemic tolerance of rat peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preischemia or prereperfusion administration of trapidil (8 mg/kg) was evaluated in the rat sciatic nerve I/R injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nerve tissue samples from the I/R injury site were assayed for malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi>, and nitrates, as markers of I/R injury, and pathological changes were evaluated by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: I/R resulted in an increase in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, which remained elevated for 2 weeks in control nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats that received trapidil before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exhibited decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, and rats that received trapidil after the standard 3 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> demonstrated increased tolerance to reperfusion, as reflected in significantly decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate levels in trapidil-treated rats were significantly higher than those in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluations of the sciatic nerve segments demonstrated that preischemia and postischemia trapidil treatments had a sparing effect against the myelin damage and axonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> that are consistently noted in untreated ischemic reperfused nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results confirm that pretreatment with trapidil before the ischemic insult or before reperfusion provides marked protection against I/R injury in peripheral nerves </plain></SENT>
