<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The naphthylsulfonate derivative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> is an inhibitor of growth factor receptors (receptor tyrosine kinases) and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both types of these receptors are suspected of being involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors examined the therapeutic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> and a selective P2X-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxalphosphate</z:chebi>-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), in the reversal of vasospasm in an established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four dogs underwent double blood injection into the cisterna magna, with injections given on Days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dogs were divided randomly into three groups (six animals in each group) to be treated from Days 2 through 6 with the vehicle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi>, or PPADS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional group of six dogs received double blood injection without any treatment and served as an SAH control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Day 0 before blood injection and again on Day 7 before the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the animals, the basilar arteries (BAs) were collected for morphological studies and determination of tyrosine kinase expression, and the bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> was collected for measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the SAH control group, the mean diameter of the BAs on Day 7 was 46.23 +/- 6.32% of the value on Day 0 (which served as a reference of 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the DMSO-treated group, the mean residual diameter of the BA was 47.77 +/- 0.8% on Day 7 compared with the value on Day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">Suramin</z:chebi>, but not PPADS, increased the residual diameter to 74.02 +/- 4.24% on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On Day 7 the level of ATP in the CSF was decreased and the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> was increased, compared with values measured on Day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">Suramin</z:chebi>, but not PPADS, reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in the spastic BAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By reducing tyrosine kinase activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> may be useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
