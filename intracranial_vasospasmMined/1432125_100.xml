<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this preliminary anecdotal series of 12 patients who were candidates for balloon angioplasty, vasospasm was treated instead with intra-arterial papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had marked angiographic reversal of the arterial narrowing following papaverine infusion, four of whom showed dramatic reversal of profound neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients deteriorated clinically 5 days after the initially successful papaverine infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both, repeat angiography demonstrated severe recurrent vasospasm, which was partially reversed with a second intra-arterial papaverine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed focal neurological deficits during papaverine infusion, which resolved spontaneously over several hours after cessation of the intra-arterial infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing in the posterior circulation and middle cerebral artery distribution appeared to be more responsive to papaverine infusion than was spasm in the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infusion of 300 mg of papaverine over 1 hour seemed to be an adequate and safe dose to effect these angiographic and clinical improvements </plain></SENT>
