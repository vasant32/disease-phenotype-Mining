<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We submit that mathematical modeling holds great promise to help synthesize diverse types of data and thereby to increase our understanding of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Toward this ultimate goal, we present constitutive relations and parametric studies that illustrate the potential utility of a new theoretical framework that combines information on wall mechanics, hemodynamics, and chemical kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, we show that chemical and mechanical mediators of cellular and extracellular matrix turnover can differentially dominate the progression and resolution of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, based on our simulations, endothelial damage can significantly alter the time-course and extent of vasospasm as can impairment of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the present results are consistent with salient features of clinically reported vasospasm, and thus provide some new insight, we suggest that most importantly they reveal areas of pressing need with regard to the collection of additional experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without appropriate data, our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> will remain incomplete </plain></SENT>
