<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding its pathogenic role in the development of vasospasm are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We planned a prospective, observational clinical study to investigate the temporal relationship between increased ET-1 production and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or other neurological sequelae after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ET-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 20 SAH patients from admission (within 24 hours from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) until day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received a daily transcranial Doppler study and a neurological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 7, angiography was performed to verify the degree and extent of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were then classified as having (1) clinical vasospasm, (2) angiographic vasospasm, (3) no vasospasm, or (4) poor neurological condition without significant vasospasm (low Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score [GCS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, ET-1 levels were increased in the low-GCS group compared with the other groups (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 4 ET-1 levels were not significantly different among groups, whereas on day 7 ET-1 levels were significantly increased in both the clinical vasospasm and low-GCS groups compared with the angiographic vasospasm and no vasospasm groups (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when the low-GCS group was excluded, there was a significant relationship between vasospasm grade and CSF ET-1 levels (R(2)=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSF ET-1 levels were markedly elevated in patients with clinical manifestations of vasospasm (day 7) and with a poor neurological condition not related to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, ET-1 levels were low in clinical vasospasm patients before clinical symptoms were evident (day 4) and remained low in angiographic vasospasm patients throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest that CSF ET-1 levels are increased in conditions of severe neuronal damage regardless whether this was due to vasospasm or to the primary hemorrhagic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, CSF ET-1 levels paralleled the neurological deterioration but were not predictive of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
