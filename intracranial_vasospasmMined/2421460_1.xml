<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed primarily to quantify the inhibition produced by antithrombin III of the phasic responses elicited by cumulative doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi>), and thrombin in isolated canine basilar arteries, and to ascertain whether other proteins might act similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (1 unit/ml and 3 units/ml) given 2 min beforehand inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibition was not dependent on a functional endothelium nor due to stimulation of the electrogenic <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alpha2-macroglobulin (0.1 mg/ml and 0.4 mg/ml) inhibited the contractile responses to high K+, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein (1 and 4 units/ml) did not inhibit <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> but inhibited high K+ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> through an effect on the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein (1 unit/ml) irreversibly blocked the responses to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Globulins (3 mg/ml) and fibrinogen (0.3 mg/ml) were not inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> proteins are very effective nonspecific inhibitors of the vasoconstriction, whereas the serine protease kallikrein selectively blocks thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remarkable potency of antithrombin III suggests that it may protect cerebral arteries from exhibiting vasospasm in SAH </plain></SENT>
