<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have been conflicting about the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> can signal the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SAH treated at a tertiary-care university hospital from January to May 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 106 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels were recorded from days 1 to 14 of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo> was defined as serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level&lt;135 meq/l and a fall in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level of &gt;4 meq/l from the admission <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of CVS was determined by transcranial doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to one of four groups based on the presence or absence of CVS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student's t-test was used for comparison of means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A logistical regression model was constructed and odds ratios (OR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 41 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> and 44 developed CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 41 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, 22 (54%) had evidence of CVS, whereas among the 65 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, 22 (34%) had evidence of CVS (P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, the mean <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> drop was 7.9 meq/L in those with CVS compared to 7.0 meq/L in those without CVS (P=0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More than half of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> and CVS (13/22) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> at least a day before CVS was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with SAH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> is associated with a significantly greater risk of developing CVS and may precede CVS by at least one day </plain></SENT>
