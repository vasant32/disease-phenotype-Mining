<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixteen dogs were entered into a study of the double <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six animals were sacrificed 72 hours after the first experimental SAH, and the remaining 10 animals were killed 72 hours after the second experimental SAH; ten additional animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were rapidly excised from the dogs and frozen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple segments of the frozen arteries were analyzed independently for total protein and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) content, which averaged 3.17 (+/- 0.27 standard error of the mean; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) pmol DAG/microgram protein for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 arteries analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A slight decreasing trend in DAG content relative to that of control vessels was found in vessels chronically constricted in situ by subarachnoid blood clot; however, this trend did not attain statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two segments of the same vessels were assayed independently for protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which averaged 1.21 (+/- 0.08 SEM) pmol phosphate incorporation per minute per microgram protein for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 arteries analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small decrease in PKC content was noted in vessels that experienced a single SAH; however, PKC returned to near control value in vessels subjected to double SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of particulate (membrane bound) to soluble PKC activity, an indicator of PKC translocation to the membrane and hence PKC activation, showed a small but statistically significant trend to increase with experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
