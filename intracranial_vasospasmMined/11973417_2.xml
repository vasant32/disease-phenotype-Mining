<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male rabbits were divided into the following four groups: APC 0.1-and 0.5-mg groups, in which 0.1 and 0.5 mg APC were injected into the cisterna magna, respectively; a placebo group, in which saline was injected instead of APC; and a sham operation group that did not get injections of autologous blood, APC, and saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 2, amount of clot in the basal cistern was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased in the APC 0.5-mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percent diameter of the basilar artery on day 2 to that before injecting the blood was angiographically determined as 97.1 +/- 3.8% in the APC 0.5-mg group, which was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) greater than the corresponding value in the placebo group (74.8 +/- 3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was normalized in the APC 0.5-mg group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that APC would improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, possibly by decreasing the amount of subarachnoid clot and normalizing the impaired nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production/release </plain></SENT>
