<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bedside-microdialysis, a new technique for on-line monitoring of cerebral metabolism, may reflect changes seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> diagnosed by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report represents the first case of combined TCD monitoring and on-line microdialysis from the brain extracellular fluid in a SAH patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old woman suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade IV according to Hunt and Hess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped 45 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microdialysis catheter was inserted after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping into the white matter of the left temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sampling of microdialysates started immediately, analyzing time for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was four minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient was doing well and microdialysis and TCD parameters remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the third postoperative day a shift to anaerob metabolism (decrease of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio up to pathological levels) and an increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was observed suggesting insufficient cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient progressively deteriorated clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was diagnosed by TCD monitoring 36 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic changes monitored by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After elevation of mean arterial blood pressure, TCD values and metabolic parameters normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the pathological changes in on-line microdialysis preceded the typical increase in blood flow velocity by TCD and the clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests, that bedside-microdialysis may be useful for early detection of vasospasm and continuous surveillance of treatment and may be a new guide to treat ischemic neurological deficits following SAH </plain></SENT>
