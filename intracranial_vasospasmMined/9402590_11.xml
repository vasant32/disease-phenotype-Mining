<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Iron catalyzed generation of injurious free radicals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the effects of the iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> deferiprone on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an in vivo rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four rabbits were assigned to three groups as follows: SAH plus placebo (n = 8), SAH plus deferiprone (n = 8), or control plus placebo (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deferiprone was administered to an additional group of three rabbits that were not subjected to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug administration was initiated 8 hours after SAH was induced and was repeated at 8-hour intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed using perfusion-fixation 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional areas of basilar artery histological sections were measured by an investigator blinded to the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In placebo-treated animals, the average <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area of the basilar artery was reduced by 54% after SAH compared to controls (i.e., from 0.272 to 0.125 mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasospastic response after SAH was attenuated significantly in animals treated with deferiprone (0.208 mm2, representing a 24% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previous experimental studies suggested that iron chelation can be effective in attenuating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deferiprone is a recently developed iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> that has been extensively evaluated for the treatment of patients requiring <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that deferiprone is effective in attenuating experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of its stability, lipophilicity, and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, deferiprone represents an attractive candidate for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
