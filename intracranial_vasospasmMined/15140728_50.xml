<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Papaverine is the primary intra-arterial (IA) treatment for vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH); however, is it limited in effect and by adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the use of IA nicardipine as a treatment for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over 12 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SAH who required interventional treatment for vasospasm were given IA nicardipine with or without angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was determined by serial clinical assessments and/or daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) imaging and confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doses of IA nicardipine per vessel were 0.5-6 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) and change in cardiovascular or neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four vessels in 18 patients with vasospasm were treated with IA nicardipine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD data for 38 vessels (15 cases) were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> vessels demonstrated immediate angiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> after IA nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No sustained cardiovascular changes were after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICP was transiently elevated in five patients and persistently elevated in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean peak systolic velocities at TCD imaging were significantly reduced from pretreatment values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated vessels for 4 days after infusion (268.9 +/- 77.8 vs 197.6 +/- 74.1 cm/s, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurologic improvement after IA nicardipine occurred in eight (42.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No clinical deterioration was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As shown by TCD imaging, IA nicardipine has an immediate and sustained effect on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It does not appear to have sustained effect on ICP or cardiovascular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This treatment warrants further study to determine its safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
