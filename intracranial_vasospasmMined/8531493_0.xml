<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to compare angiography with iterative measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the microsphere technique for tracking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced in anaesthetised rabbits by injecting 1 ml of fresh blood in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a first experiment, the diameter of the basilar artery was measured by repeated angiograms over 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second experiment, rCBF was measured over 60 min by the radioactive microspheres method without and with bilateral ligation of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Without carotid ligation, despite a profound transient vasospasm of the basilar artery, rCBF was unchanged in the cerebellum and cerebrum and was not statistically decreased in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with bilateral carotid ligation, rCBF dramatically decreased at 5 and 15 min after haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 30 min, despite a persistent 50% decrease in the basilar cross-sectional area, rCBF was no longer different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm of the basilar artery, rCBF evaluation by the microsphere technique parallels the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> evaluated by angiography only when both carotid arteries are ligated </plain></SENT>
