<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum from coagulated blood causes prompt and long-lasting microvascular constriction that is neurogenic in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a candidate spasmogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi>, has excitatory action on neural elements in the slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, spasmogenic serum lacks this excitatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead, it is inhibitory for a major population of slice neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, neurogenic microvascular spasm is produced by a subpopulation of slice neurons or projection fibers, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurons acting in concert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is contained in fibers that project to the hippocampus, and hippocampal microvessels contain pressor (V1) receptors for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AVP causes vasoconstriction in the slice, and a specific V1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> blocks the microvascular spasm induced by blood serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are interpreted to mean that neurogenic microvascular spasm is mediated by locally released AVP </plain></SENT>
