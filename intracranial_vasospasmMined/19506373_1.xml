<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Selective inhibition of phosphodiesterase type III (PDE III) may be involved in the pathophysiology of vasospasm and a PDE III inhibitor, cilostazol, is thus expected to attenuate vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the therapeutic effects of cilostazol on angiographic and morphological vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-one mongrel dogs were divided into 4 groups: (1) control (n = 3); (2) SAH (n = 6); (3) SAH with low-dose treatment (n = 6), and (4) SAH with high-dose treatment (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the established double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH achieved by injecting autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on day 0 and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were euthanized after a second angiogram, and Western blotting was performed to analyze phenotypic changes in smooth muscle cells of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was sectioned for immunohistochemistry of SM1, SM2 and SMemb to analyze phenotypic changes (SM1, SM2 for the contractile type of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and SMemb for the synthetic type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intact endothelial cells were counted under a microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe vasospasm was obtained in the SAH group (42 +/- 1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol attenuated angiographic vasospasm in both treatment groups (63 +/- 2 and 74 +/- 4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevention of endothelial damage and phenotypic changes in smooth muscle cells were observed in both treatment groups (p &lt; 0.05 vs. control, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cilostazol attenuates vasospasm following SAH in dogs by suppressing phenotypic changes in the basilar artery and preventing endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we anticipate that cilostazol may be useful in the management of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
