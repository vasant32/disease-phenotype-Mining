<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of ET-1 to this condition has not been definitely established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether threshold concentration of ET-1 enhances cerebrovascular smooth muscle (CVSM) contraction to OxyHb by activating the RhoA/Rho kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVSM contraction was measured in endothelium-denuded rabbit basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic and particulate fractions of CVSM cells were examined for RhoA and PKC reactivity with specific antibodies using immunoblotting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET-1 (0.1 nM) alone did not produce any significant contraction, but it markedly potentiated the magnitude (223% of control) and rate (149% of control) of contraction in response to OxyHb, which was attenuated by the inhibitors of Rho kinase Y-27632 and HA-1077 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1-mediated potentiation of the contraction was also inhibited by inhibitors of PKC, Ro-32-0432, and GF-109203X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BQ-123 prevented potentiation of vasoconstriction mediated by ET-1, indicating that the action of ET-1 was mediated by the endothelin type A receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with ET-1 significantly enhanced OxyHb-mediated RhoA translocation in CVSM cells and intact basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ET-1 also caused potentiation of PKC-epsilon expression in membranes of CVSM cells exposed to OxyHb for 10 and 60 min but did not markedly change the distribution of PKC-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, in CVSM, threshold concentration of ET-1 potentiates contraction induced by OxyHb via RhoA/Rho kinase- and PKC-epsilon-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This process may contribute to the pathological contraction of cerebral arteries observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
