<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was enclosed in <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes or mixed with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomers and polymerized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The release rate of papaverine from the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes and elastomers into a saline solution was measured for 5 weeks at 37 degrees C and at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the volume of released papaverine was extremely large in the first two days, a constant release rate was maintained until the 35th day in vitro for both types of pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The daily amount of released papaverine was 1.5 to 3.0 x 10(-2)/day, and 1 to 4 x 10(-6)/day of original volume from <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomers and tubes, respectively, at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The release rate at 37 degrees C was 10 times as high as at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomers were applied, the rate was well correlated with the surface area of the pellets, and was measured as 2.5 to 5.0 x 10(-5)/day/mm2 of the original volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It means that when a pellet of 4 mm in diameter x 45 mm in length (a surface area of 600 mm2) is applied, 61.7% of the papaverine is released from the pellet during the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither adverse reaction or intracranial histological abnormality was noted in vivo during the 40-day observation period using a dog, in which two pellets containing 275 mg and 297 mg of papaverine were subcutaneously implanted, and a pellet containing 275 mg of papaverine intracranially.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
