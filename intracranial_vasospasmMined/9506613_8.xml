<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-induced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in glia throughout the rat brain without affecting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-2 (HO-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the expression of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenases after SAH is thus far unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to clarify the effect of vasospasm on the expression of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenases in a rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelin, hemolysate, hemolysate saturated with <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO-hemolysate), and saline were injected into the cisterna magna of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was repeated before each injection and 15 and 60 minutes and 24 hours after each injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry for HO-1, HO-2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed 24 hours after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant vasospasm occurred in the basilar artery after the injection of endothelin, hemolysate, and CO-hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm was most prominent 15 minutes after each injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the degree of vasospasm among injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HO-1 was induced exclusively in the glial cells throughout the brain after injection of hemolysate and CO-hemolysate; however, it was not induced by endothelin and saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the HO-1-positive cells were also stained for GFAP, suggesting astrocytic glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, HO-2 immunoreactivity was abundant in neurons and was not affected by endothelin, hemolysate, CO-hemolysate, or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> per se, rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by vasospasm, plays a pivotal role in the expression of HO-1 in this rat model </plain></SENT>
