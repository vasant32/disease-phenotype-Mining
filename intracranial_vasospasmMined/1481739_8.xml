<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of angiographically demonstrable vasospasm for disturbances of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral autoregulation has not yet been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to describe disturbances of cerebral autoregulation during the timecourse of experimental SAH (eSAH) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second aim of the study was to relate the results to a reported timecourse of angiographic vasospasm in the same animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the timecourse of angiographically visible vasospasm in eSAH is biphasic with maximal spasm at 10 min and 2 days after induction of eSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5 days, the vasospasms have resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured using a 133-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> intracarotid injection method which allowed serial measurements of mean hemispheric CBF during controlled manipulations of arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this way, an autoregulation curve could be constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that autoregulation is severely disturbed or even totally absent at 2 and 5 days after eSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus there seems to be no direct correlation between presence of angiographic vasospasm and impairment of autoregulation, or that the impairment of autoregulation is more protracted than the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, presuming a correlation exist </plain></SENT>
