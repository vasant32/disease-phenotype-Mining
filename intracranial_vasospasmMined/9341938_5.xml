<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In CoQ10-untreated rabbits, moderate to severe neurological deficits developed, and multiple focal ischemic lesions were found in the brain regions with compromised blood supply, i.e., in the regions normally supplied by common carotid arteries which are subject to ligation in this model </plain></SENT>
