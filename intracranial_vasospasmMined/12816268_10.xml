<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Note, however, that blood clot size on admission remains the only factor consistently demonstrated to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess whether clinical, radiographic, or serological variables could be used to identify patients at an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with aneurysmal or spontaneous nonaneurysmal SAH who were admitted to the authors' institution between 1995 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>), Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades, patient age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, craniotomy compared with endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> stabilization, medications on admission, postoperative steroid agent use, and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> were assessed as predictors of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twenty-four patients were treated for SAH during the review period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred one patients (45%) developed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak vasospasm occurred 5.8 +/- 3 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were four independent predictors of vasospasm: Fisher Grade 3 SAH (odds ratio [OR] 7.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-15.8), peak serum leukocyte count (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16), rupture of a posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.41), and spontaneous nonaneurysmal SAH (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A serum leukocyte count greater than 15 x 10(9)/L was independently associated with a 3.3-fold increase in the likelihood of developing vasospasm (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.74-6.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During this 7-year period, spontaneous nonaneurysmal SAH and ruptured <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> decreased the odds of developing vasospasm sevenfold and 20-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of Fisher Grade 3 SAH on admission or a peak leukocyte count greater than 15 x 10(9)/L increased the odds of vasospasm sevenfold and threefold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of the serum leukocyte count may allow for early diagnosis and treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
