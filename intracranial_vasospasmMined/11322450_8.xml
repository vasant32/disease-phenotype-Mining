<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of liposomal fasudil in a sustained-release form for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen rats were divided into three groups, each of which received 2.5 mg/kg of liposomal fasudil, 5 mg/kg of liposomal fasudil, or drug-free liposomes after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next, experimental SAH was induced in 15 dogs by injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna twice after baseline vertebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six dogs, 0.94 mg/kg of liposomal fasudil was injected into the cisterna magna (treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four dogs, drug-free liposomes were similarly injected (placebo group), and the remaining five dogs were not treated with liposomal injection after SAH (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was repeated on Day 7, and cerebrospinal fluid was collected before the dogs were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high dose of liposomal fasudil caused no significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure and did not induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gross and microscopic examination of the brains revealed no abnormalities, but severe vasospasm was noted in the rat basilar artery, mainly in the group treated with drug-free liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in the canine placebo and control groups, significant vasospasm occurred in the basilar artery on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, vasospasm in the basilar artery was significantly ameliorated (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo, 90% of fasudil was released from liposomes in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single injection of intrathecal liposomal fasudil is safe and effective for the prevention of vasospasm in experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
