<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes of intimal ultrastructure in experimental vasospasm induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> were investigated by scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cats were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was exposed by transcervico-transclival approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> solution was applied under the arachnoid membrane around the artery in 16 cats at hourly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 16 cats, 3 were sacrificed at 1 hour after the first application of the solution, 3 at 3 hours, 3 at 6 hours, 3 at 12 hours, 4 at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three sham-operated cats treated by artificial CSF were used as the control together with 5 untreated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed under aseptic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perfusion fixation was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface and the cut surface made by freeze-fracture method were investigated by scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> solution, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-rich hemolysate was used and the concentration was 5.5 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By hourly application, continuous vasoconstriction of about 70% of the control diameter was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the control, the endothelial cell layer was flat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The elastic lamina had mild waving, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface was smooth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 1- and 3-hour groups, the elastic lamina was corrugated and the endothelial cells were protruded into the lumen in the depressed portion of corrugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 6- and 12-hour groups, degenerative changes of the endothelial cells, crater-formation and ballooning, were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Some blood-born cells adhered to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In 24-hour group, the changes of the endothelial cells became more remarkable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
