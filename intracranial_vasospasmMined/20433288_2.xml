<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS AND METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into three groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(Group 1 = control:sham surgery group, Group 2 = SAH alone group, Group 3 = SAH plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination was performed on day 3 as described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> dose (initially 12 microg kg(-1) infusion, continuously for at least 10 minutes and then continued with a dose of 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) treatment was started after the induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three days later, the animals were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In pathological investigation; there was statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and muscular wall thickness of the basilar artery between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde level was also found significantly low in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> group compared with the SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> treatment was found effective by increasing the pathological <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and reducing muscular wall thickness measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to show that intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> is effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
