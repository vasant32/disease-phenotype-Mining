<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work is to find an experimental model of reliable, simple and in vivo monitoring of ''early'' basilar artery spasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early spasm occurs within minutes of the SAH, its duration is approximately 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The need of different morphological and haemodynamic methods to evaluate experimental early spasm is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To overcome intracranial surgical manipulations and biological of contrast and fixation media we designed a model that allows in vivo functional monitoring of basilar blood flow far away from the spasm without direct surgical and chemical interferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen adult Burgundy rabbits were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under homeostatic monitoring ''on-line'' carotid blood flow (carotid BF) .changes produced by SAH in cisterna magna of 12 (plus 5 sham treated) animals were studied from the common carotid artery after external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> before, during SAH up to the end of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals underwent digital subtraction cerebral panangiography (CPA) after SAH obtaining a significant increase of carotid BF only when basilar vasospasm was shown by CPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid BF increase during basilar vasospasm was defined ''functional. monitoring'' of early spasm </plain></SENT>
