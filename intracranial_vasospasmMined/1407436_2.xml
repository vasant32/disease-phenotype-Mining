<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 2 was a treatment group that received an intravenous injection of ONO-1078, a novel potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49159">leukotriene antagonist</z:chebi>, once a day for 7 days just after the first cisternal injection of the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Days 0 and 7, and the cerebrospinal fluid levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>) were measured on Days 0, 3, and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cisternal levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But the cerebrospinal fluid levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angiographic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was partially prevented with the treatment of intravenous injections of ONO-1078 (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, directly or indirectly, and ONO-1078 may have a therapeutic effect on the prevention of the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
