<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to establish the effect of the therapeutic modalities on vasospasm, to establish morbidity and mortality of patients with SAH, as well as the causes of the poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study is prospective and analyzes 192 patients treated at C ward of the INH <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm incidence was 22.40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic modalities depended on prescribed quantities of colloid solutions and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in the vasospasm incidence between the groups were not significant, the reason probably being that the maximal doses of colloid solutions were prescribed mostly to the higher graded patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> vasospasm was less frequent, but not statistically significant (11.11% vs. 23.56%) Of 192 patients, 78.1% completely recovered, 9.9% had a certain degree of invalidity, and 12.0% did not survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was vasospasm (41.67%) and then general medical complications (20.93%) </plain></SENT>
