<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many pharmacologic agents and chemicals have been used to prevent and treat CV, the pathogenesis of that condition has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> that occurs naturally in grapes and red wine, in a murine basilar artery vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into 3 groups of 14 animals each: the sham-operated control group (group 1), the vasospasm group (group 2), and the treatment group (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In groups 2 and 3, autologous blood (0.3 mL) was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After that injection, the rats in group 3 received an intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg) for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the response to both the injection of autologous blood and treatment was based on biochemical markers in tissue and serum and on light microscopic findings from the basilar artery, which were collected at different intervals after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelin-1 levels in brain tissue and serum were higher in the vasospasm group than in the control group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 3 rats, the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> resulted in significantly lower ET-1 values than those in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation levels were markedly elevated in group 2 rats but decreased significantly after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment in group 3 rats (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase expression in brain tissue and serum was lower in group 2 rats than in sham-operated controls, and a significant increase in the SOD level was associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On examination via light microscopy 72 hours after SAH, the mean perimeters of the arterial lumen in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 719 +/- 16, 411.6 +/- 9, and 590.1 +/- 5.6 microm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean thickness of the arterial wall was as follows: in group 1, 11.1 +/- 0.8 microm; in group 2, 16.1 +/- 1.2 microm; and (after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> treatment) in group 3, 13.4 +/- 0.6 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> induced the relaxation of smooth muscle in the wall of the basilar artery and may be provided with neuroprotection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These effects may be associated with the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and vasodilatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, which could prove to be an agent prophylactic against CV and to be therapeutic for individuals who experience that event </plain></SENT>
