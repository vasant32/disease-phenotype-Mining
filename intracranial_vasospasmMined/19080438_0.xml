<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty rabbits underwent occlusion of bilateral carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later the 28 surviving rabbits were randomly divided into to 4 groups: shamed-operation group (n = 8) undergoing injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline into the cisterna magna on day 1 and day 3, SAH group (n = 6) undergoing injection of nonheparinized autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna, HTK therapy group (n = 6) undergoing blood injection into the cisterna magna and then injection of HTK via ear marginal vein daily for 3 days, and nimodipine (ND) therapy group (n = 6) undergoing blood injection into the cisterna magna and then injection of ND via ear marginal vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3-dimension-CT angiography (3-D CTA) was used to measure the basilar artery diameter on D(0) and D(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On D(6) the rabbits were killed with their basilar arteries taken out to undergo light microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood could be seen in the basis cephalic of the 3 groups undergoing blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3-D CTA showed that arteriospasm was seen in the SAH and ND groups but not in the HTK group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopy showed obvious pathological changes in basilar artery in the SAH and ND groups but not in the HTK group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HTK given early after SAH effectively alleviates the symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
