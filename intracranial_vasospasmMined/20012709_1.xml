<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional treatment modalities are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular nicardipine has been suggested as a potential therapy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is an appealing option for multiple reasons: many of these patients already have ventricular drains in place, it can be safely administered at the bedside, and can be used in patients for whom conventional therapies are either not effective or not tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received intraventricular nicardipine for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> from January 2006 to June 2007 at a university tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients received intraventricular nicardipine during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular nicardipine administration was associated with a reduction of the mean cerebral blood flow velocity of 26.3 cm/s in the middle cerebral artery and 7.4 cm/s in the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reduction was maintained over 24 h with continued administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular nicardipine was associated with a significant and sustained reduction in mean cerebral blood flow velocity as measured by transcranial Doppler when used in the treatment of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We do not find significant safety concerns related to elevations of intracranial pressure or ventricular catheter related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are warranted to better determine the efficacy and safety of this therapy </plain></SENT>
