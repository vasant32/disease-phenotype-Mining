<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endothelin (ET) has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, it has been linked to the delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have identified the ET receptors present on human middle meningeal and pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative autoradiography was carried out using [125I]ET-1 to visualize the total ET receptor population or [125I]PD151242, or [125I]BQ3020, <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>- and ETB-selective receptor ligands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[125I]ET-1 and [125I]PD151242 bound specifically with high density to the vascular smooth muscle of both arteries; little or no specific [125I]BQ3020 binding was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry localized the mature ET to endothelial cells of pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors predominate in human middle meningeal and pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In pial arteries, ET, which may be synthesized locally by the endothelium, may then act on this receptor subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it has yet to be determined whether this receptor subtype is involved in conditions such as the delayed vasospasm associated with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility of changes in ET receptor subtype(s) under pathophysiologic conditions should be considered </plain></SENT>
