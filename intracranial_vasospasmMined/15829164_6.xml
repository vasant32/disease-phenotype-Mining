<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The current study was undertaken to determine whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> therapy reverses vasospasm and prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rabbits were divided into four groups as follows: Group 1, SAH + <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg/i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BID) simultaneously with SAH (n = 6); Group 2, SAH + <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg/i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BID) treated 2 hours after SAH (n = 6); Group 3, control group (n = 4); Group 4, SAH only (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic examinations of the basilar arteries were performed to demonstrate the pathophysiological changes of the arterial wall with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>- eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>: Immunohistology using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> Detection Kit was used to demonstrate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a cross section of basilary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic index was calculated as the number of the immunoreactive nuclei per total number of endothelial cells, and expressed as a percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of measurements of diameters of the vessels between groups were significantly different (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While basilar arteries of the SAH only group showed 57% constriction, Groups 1 and 2 were calculated as 33 and 26% constriction, respectively, compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And also Groups 1 and 2 showed significant protection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> compared with Group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference between the four groups was tested by Kruskal-Wallis test and the significance between the two groups was tested by Mann- Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> with its strong <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect can prevent SAH-induced vasospasm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endothelial cells of vessels </plain></SENT>
