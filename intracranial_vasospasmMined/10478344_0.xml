<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no effective treatments other than surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, another option for decreasing the occurrence of SAH may be prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> formation and of their rupture by controlling risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking has been recently shown to be one of the major risk factors for SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether cigarette smoking increased the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Degree of smoking was investigated in 182 patients with SAH and in 123 patients with an unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> incidentally detected during investigation of other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients with other diseases who were shown to be free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> through <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking significantly increased the risk of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and SAH; The odds ratio for SAH was 2.4, and for unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> 1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking especially increased the occurrence of SAH in women and in youngsters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, smoking did not influence the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and multiplicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the importance of avoiding smoking to prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and of SAH </plain></SENT>
