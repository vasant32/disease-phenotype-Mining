<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 276 patients, who underwent surgery within 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) of Hunt and Hess Grades I to IV, were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were excluded because of protocol violation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 267 patients received either 30 mg AT877 or a placebo (saline) by intravenous injection over 30 minutes, three times a day for 14 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data were well matched between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that AT877 reduced angiographically demonstrable vasospasm by 38% (from 61% in the placebo group to 38% in the AT877 group, p = 0.0023), low-density regions on computerized tomography associated with vasospasm by 58% (from 38% to 16%, p = 0.0013), and symptomatic vasospasm by 30% (from 50% to 35%, p = 0.0247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AT877 reduced the number of patients with a poor clinical outcome associated with vasospasm (moderate disability or worse on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 1 month after SAH) by 54% (from 26% to 12%, p = 0.0152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events reported in the AT877 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a placebo-controlled double-blind trial that has demonstrated a significant reduction in angiographically revealed vasospasm by intravenous drug therapy </plain></SENT>
