<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, is a peripheral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, an anti-inflammatory, and causes antiplatelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated these effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after rat SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: SAH + <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> feed (SAH group; n=14), SAH + feed containing 0·1% cilostazol (cilostazol group; n=12) and sham-operated rats (sham group; n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries (BA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were analysed by measuring wall thickness, internal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> perimeter and cross-sectional area on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study with RM-4, an anti-rat macrophage/dendritic cells monoclonal antibody and ultrastructural study with transmission electron microscopy were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although most animals in the SAH group presented with typical vasospasm, the means of inner perimeter and cross-section area of the BA in the cilostazol group were significantly greater than the SAH group (836 ± 134 μm versus 771 ± 125 μm and 39 177 ± 15 405 μm(2) versus 33 098 ± 13 871 μm(2), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wall thickness of the BA in the cilostazol group demonstrated significant decrease, compared with the SAH group (17·4 ± 2·3 versus 21·0 ± 2·7 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In immunohistological study, SAH induced an obvious increase in mean perivascular RM-4-positive cell count, whereas cilostazol significantly reduced it by 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural study depicted cilostazol markedly attenuating structural deterioration of the vascular wall due to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that cilostazol attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in rat, possibly in part due to the anti-inflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
