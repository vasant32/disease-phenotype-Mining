<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Cerebrospinal fluid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, or "brain sag," is a recently described phenomenon most commonly seen following craniotomy for the clipping of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> along with preoperative lumbar drain placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features and CT findings have been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation can be similar to and often mistaken for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors report on the angiographic findings in patients with brain sag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five cases of brain sag were diagnosed (range 1-4 days) after the surgical treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the University of Illinois at Chicago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met the clinical and CT criteria for brain sag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Admission cerebral angiograms and subsequent angiograms during symptoms of brain sag were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, angiography was performed after the resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients, the level of the basilar artery apex was displaced inferiorly with respect to the posterior clinoid processes during brain sag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This displacement was significant enough to create a noticeable kink in the basilar artery ("cobra sign") in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other angiographic findings included foreshortening or kinking of the intracranial vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the posterior cerebral arteries were displaced medially and inferiorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients were treated for simultaneous severe radiological vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, the brain sag was recognized, and the patients' conditions improved when they were placed flat or in the Trendelenburg position, at times combined with an epidural blood patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with follow-up angiography studies after the symptoms had resolved displayed a reversal of the angiographic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain sag appears to be associated with characteristic angiographic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recognizing these features may help to diagnose brain sag as the cause of neurological deterioration in this patient population </plain></SENT>
