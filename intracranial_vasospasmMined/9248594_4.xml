<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether different endogeneous vasoconstrictors exert synergistic effects in isolated human cerebral arteries, because potentiation of contractile effects may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated human pial arteries obtained from macroscopically intact tissue during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e> operations were mounted onto a wire myograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentration-response curves of 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) were constructed in the absence and presence of threshold concentrations of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>)-analog U46619, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Threshold concentrations of U46619 markedly enhanced the maximum contractile effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> remained markedly increased even after washout of U46619 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Threshold concentrations of ET-1 increased the maximum response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, and markedly shifted the dose-response curve to the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even after washout of ET-1, the dose-response curve of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> remained shifted to the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase of the contractile effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in the presence of U46619 did not correlate with the relaxant action of the endothelium-dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, synergism between contractile substances such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, U46619, or ET-1 is seen in human cerebral arteries, and responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> are potentiated even after washout of ET-1 and U46619 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potentiation does not depend on the endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that synergistic responses between endogeneous vasoconstrictors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> and ET-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
