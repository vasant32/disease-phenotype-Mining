<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigators previously found that CGS 26303 is effective in preventing and reversing arterial narrowing in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules are altered after treatment with CGS 26303 in this animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were each injected with 3 ml of autologous blood in the cisterna magna, and intravenous treatment with CGS 26303 (30 mg/kg) was initiated 1 hour later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compound was subsequently administered at 12, 24, and 36 hours post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected at 48 hours post-SAH to measure ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the rabbits had been killed by perfusion-fixation, the basilar arteries (BAs) were removed and sliced, and their cross-sectional areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS 26303 attenuated arterial narrowing after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina of BAs was prominently observed in the SAH only and vehicle-treated SAH groups, but not in the CGS 26303-treated SAH group or in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of VCAM-1 among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of E-selectin were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals subjected to SAH (those in the SAH only, SAH plus vehicle, and SAH plus CGS 26303 groups) compared with healthy controls (no SAH); however, the levels of ICAM-1 in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups were significantly elevated (p &lt; 0.001), and treatment with CGS 26303 reduced ICAM-1 to control levels following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ICAM-1 may play a role in mediating SAH-induced vasospasm and that a reduction of ICAM-1 levels after SAH may partly contribute to the antispastic effect of CGS 26303 </plain></SENT>
