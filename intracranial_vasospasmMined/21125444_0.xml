<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, delayed CVS treatment model with oral administration of cilostazol can be seen in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: in this study, 25 male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to five groups: control, SAH only, SAH/nimodipine, SAH/cilostazol, SAH/vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals' basilar arteries were sectioned from four separate zones and four sections were obtained from each rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas were measured by using SPOT for windows Version 4.1 computer program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in SAH/ nimodipine and SAH/ cilostazol groups were significantly higher than SAH only group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor cilostazol has vasodilatory effects without affecting cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> and is still used in vasospasm therapy either oral or intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that prophylactic bolus intrathecal administration of either cilostazol or nimodipine equally prevents SAH-associated CVS in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that cilostazol is a candidate for clinical trials in the treatment of delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
