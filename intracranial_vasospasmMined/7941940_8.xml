<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ET-LI levels in plasma and CSF (n = 24) were 12.4 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- s.d.) and 9.1 +/- 1.2 pg.ml-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma ET-LI levels in patients with SAH before surgery (16.8 +/- 7.8 pg.ml-1, n = 8) were higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (P &lt; 0.05), and became further elevated after surgery (22.5 +/- 9.4 pg.ml-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ET-LI levels in plasma and CSF one day after surgery were 18.7 +/- 5.5 and 18.4 +/- 6.8 pg.ml-1 (P &lt; 0.01 vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values), respectively, and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma and CSF ET-LI levels in patients who showed symptomatic vasospasm became concomitantly elevated again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ET is involved in SAH-related vasospasm and raise the possibility that surgical stress influences the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
