<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was confirmed 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection, a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoqu inone (AA-861), was infused intravenously at 6.5 X 10(-4) mg/kg/min for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was not reversed, and mean regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In other studies, oral doses of AA-861 at 100 mg/kg/day were given twice a day for 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treated group, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was significantly reduced, and the contractile property of excised basilar arteries in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50514">vasoconstrictor agents</z:chebi> was significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi>, 5-<z:mp ids='MP_0002524'>lipoxygenase products</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, might be important etiologic factors responsible for the development of delayed vasospasm and that AA-861 would have a therapeutic effect not on the reduction of delayed vasospasm once developed but on the prevention of the development of delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
