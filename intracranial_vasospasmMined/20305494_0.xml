<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is secreted in and around the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of PDGF-BB in the development of vasospasm after SAH, we determined whether PDGF-BB alone can cause long-lasting vasoconstriction of a severity similar to that of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anti-vasospastic effect of trapidil, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of PDGF-BB function, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We infused recombinant PDGF-BB (10 microg/mL saline as the vehicle) (n = 14) into the subarachnoid space of rabbits and analyzed alterations in the caliber of the basilar artery using repeated angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study the role of PDGF-BB on the development of vasospasm, trapidil was administered continuously starting 1 hour after SAH, on day 0 (0.63-1.25 mg/kg /h or vehicle) for 47 hours (n = 24), or after the full development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on day 2 (3.0 mg/kg/h or vehicle) for 0.5 hours (n = 17), and alterations in the caliber of the basilar artery were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PDGF-BB caused long-lasting vasoconstriction, with maximum constriction of 56% (P &lt; .001) of the control value (= 100%) on day 2, resembling vasospasm seen after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged administration of intravenous trapidil, starting soon after SAH, prevented the development of vasospasm in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; .05, .01, or .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous or intra-arterial administration of trapidil significantly dilated vasospasm (P &lt; .01) on day 2, at least transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PDGF-BB, a growth factor synthesized in the subarachnoid space after SAH, can cause severe and long-lasting vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant prevention and resolution of vasospasm can be achieved by the PDGF-BB <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> trapidil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that excessive production of PDGF-BB, essentially aiming to repair injured arteries, causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the half-life of trapidil in serum may be shorter than that of PDGFG-BB-derived spasmogenic signaling, trapidil is a candidate drug for constructing a new therapeutic modality for preventing and resolving vasospasm </plain></SENT>
