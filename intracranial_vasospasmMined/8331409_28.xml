<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors measured the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> in experimental subarachnoid clot and studied its effects on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and 45Ca++ uptake of vascular smooth-muscle cells dissociated from canine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Craniectomies were performed in five dogs under general anesthesia, and 3 to 5 ml of autologous whole blood was deposited in the supraclinoid subarachnoid compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> recovered by Folch extraction from clotted material removed 7 days after surgery was 390 +/- 247 microM (mean +/- standard error of the mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean vascular smooth-muscle cell length after 40 minutes of exposure to 50 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> was 37.3 +/- 1.2 microns (control 51.6 +/- 1.6 microns) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean percent permeation of 45Ca++, measured by a dual label technique, of cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> was 200.9% +/- 23% (control 102.9% +/- 4.3%) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> accrues in subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, that it exerts a constrictive effect on vascular smooth-muscle cells, and that this effect is associated with an increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi> should be included in the list of potential agents that participate in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
