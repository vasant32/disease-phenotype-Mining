<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanism for the development of post-haemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) still remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the role of thrombin and its receptor PAR1 in the development of hyper-contractility of the basilar artery in a rabbit double haemorrhage model, which received two injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: In the basilar artery isolated from the control rabbits, thrombin, only at 10 units ml(-1), induced a transient endothelium-dependent relaxation and a slight smooth muscle contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SAH, the contractile response to thrombin was markedly enhanced, while the endothelium-dependent relaxant effect of thrombin remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of the contractile responses was also observed in the absence of endothelium and thrombin induced an enhanced contraction at concentrations higher than 0.3 units ml(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contractile response to PAR1-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was also enhanced after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the contractile responses to high K+ and endothelin-1, and the myofilament <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-sensitivity remained unchanged after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunoblot analysis suggested the up-regulation of PAR1 in the smooth muscle of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The heparinization of blood before injection prevented the enhancement of the contractile responses to thrombin and PAR1-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that the contractile response of the basilar artery to thrombin was markedly enhanced after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, our findings suggested that the activation of thrombin following <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> up-regulated the expression of PAR1, thereby inducing the hyper-responsiveness to thrombin </plain></SENT>
