<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous clinical and experimental studies have been performed in the last decades; however, the pathophysiologic mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH still remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among a variety of experimental SAH models, the double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rat model involving direct injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna has been used most frequently for the study of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH in last years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the simplicity of the technique, the second blood injection into the cisterna magna may result in brainstem injury leading to high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a modified double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of cisterna magna has been developed in rat recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe here step by step the surgical technique to induce double SAH and compare the degree of vasospasm with other cisterna magna rat models using histological assessment of the diameter and cross-sectional area of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
