<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of thiocolchicoside to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups of eight rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>), group 3 (treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thiocolchicoside (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered just before intracisternal blood injection and continued for 72 h once a day in the same dose for group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 72 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery cross-sectional areas and arterial wall thicknesses were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraperitoneal administration of thiocolchicoside was found to attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thiocolchicoside treatment was determined to be effective in increasing the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and reducing the wall thickness of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, for the first time, showed that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> can prevent vasospasm induced by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also showed that GABAergic activity may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the thiocolchicoside treatment might be beneficial in preventing vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, thus showing potential for clinical application </plain></SENT>
