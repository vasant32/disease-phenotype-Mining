<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (PNSAH), more commonly known as perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, is characterized by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> anterior to the midbrain with no evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> on four vessel craniocervical angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although vasospasm is a common occurrence after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, vasospasm in the setting of PNSAH is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a patient with PNSAH who developed significant radiographic vasospasm of the basilar artery that altered clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current literature on this uncommon disease entity and management considerations are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A four-vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on hospital day (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) two that did not demonstrate any apparent vascular abnormality or vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A repeat craniocervical angiogram on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> 8 demonstrated significant stenosis of the basilar artery consistent with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient continued to be neurologically intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A repeat cerebral angiogram performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> 15 demonstrated resolving vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There continued to be no evidence of a source of his initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PNSAH is associated with an excellent clinical course that is rarely associated with long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> rarely develops radiographically or clinically in patients with PNSAH, evidence suggests that clinical observation comparable to that performed in patients with aneurysmal SAH should be performed until a second confirmatory study has conclusively ruled out an aneurysmal source and until clinical and radiographic evidence of resolution of severe vasospasm is obtained </plain></SENT>
