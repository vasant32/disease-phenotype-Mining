<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is involved in smooth muscle contraction induced by growth factors and/or G protein-coupled receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of PI3-kinase in the pathogenesis of delayed vasospasm, we applied 2 PI3-kinase inhibitors to an established canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four dogs underwent double blood injections via the cisterna magna on days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dogs were killed on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs were treated with either vehicle (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, or LY294002 once per day on day 2 through day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed before blood injection and before the dogs were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were collected for <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, Western blot analysis, and PI3-kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The residual diameter of the basilar arteries in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> treatment group, which was compared with day 0 angiogram, decreased markedly on day 7 (the percentage of the residual diameter was 47.8+/-0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">Wortmannin</z:chebi> and LY294002 did not significantly change residual diameter on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3-kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> abolished PI3-kinase activity compared with the vehicle treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3-kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> failed to significantly attenuate PI3-kinase protein expression (Western blot) (P&gt;0.05, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delayed treatment, which was to mimic the clinical situation, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3-kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> failed to reverse vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PI3-kinase may not play an important role in the delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possible effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50914">PI3-kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> in the early stage of vasospasm was not investigated in the present study </plain></SENT>
