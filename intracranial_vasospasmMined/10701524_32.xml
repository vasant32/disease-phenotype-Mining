<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) seems to be complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm may be endothelin (ET), with its powerful and long-lasting vasoconstricting activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the author investigated the correlation between serial plasma concentrations of ET and ischemic symptoms, angiographically demonstrated evidence of vasospasm, and computerized tomography (CT) findings after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelin-1 immunoreactivity in plasma was studied in 70 patients with aneurysmal SAH and in 25 healthy volunteers by using a double-antibody sandwich-enzyme immunoassay (immunometric) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the whole, mean plasma ET concentrations in patients with SAH (mean +/- standard error of mean, 2.1 +/- 0.1 pg/ml) did not differ from those of healthy volunteers (1.9 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelin concentrations were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in patients who experienced delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with fixed neurological deficits compared with those in other patients (post-SAH Days 0-5, 3.1 +/- 0.8 pg/ml compared with 2.1 +/- 0.2 pg/ml; post-SAH Days 6-14, 2.5 +/- 0.4 pg/ml compared with 1.9 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with angiographic evidence of severe vasospasm also had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated ET concentrations (post-SAH Days 0-5, 3.2 +/- 0.8 pg/ml; post-SAH Days 6-14, 2.7 +/- 0.5 pg/ml) as did those with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> larger than a lacuna on the follow-up CT scan (post-SAH Days 0-5, 3.1 +/- 0.8 pg/ml; post-SAH Days 6-14, 2.5 +/- 0.4 pg/ml) compared with other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom angiography revealed diffuse moderate-to-severe vasospasm had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher ET levels than other patients within 24 hours before or after angiography (2.6 +/- 0.3 compared with 1.9 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or cigarette smoking experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> significantly more often than other patients, although angiography did not demonstrate severe or diffuse vasospasm more often in these patients than in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endothelin concentrations seem to correlate with delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest levels of ET are predictive of the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and vasospasm, and ET may also worsen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, ET may be an important causal or contributing factor to vasospasm, but its significance in the pathogenesis of vasospasm remains unknown </plain></SENT>
