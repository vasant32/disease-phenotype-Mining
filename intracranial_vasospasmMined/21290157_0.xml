<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We consider that in the two presented cases the main cause of CVS in early postoperative period was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenomas</z:hpo> were operated with trans-sphenoidal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVS developed in early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> was revealed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVS regressed only after successful treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first case empiric antibiotic therapy was ineffective and CVS remained until Klebsiella <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was detected in CSF and specific therapy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second case empiric therapy was effective and CVS vasospasm regressed in 12Â days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> can be a leading cause of CVS in early postoperative period in trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> shortens duration of CVS in these patients </plain></SENT>
