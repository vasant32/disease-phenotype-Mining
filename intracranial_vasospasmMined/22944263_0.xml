<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) orchestrates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a variety of cell types in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, implicated in the brain injury after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of CHOP in the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after SAH remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CHOP silencing on endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and CVS following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted on 65 rats and employed endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CHOP siRNAs were injected 24 h prior to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 72 h after SAH brains with basilar arteries (BA) were collected from euthanized rats for laboratory investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple fluorescence stain revealed expression of CHOP in cerebral vascular endothelia after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marked reduction of CHOP protein and the reduction of its downstream signaling effectors, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">bim</z:chebi> and caspase-3, were found in BA with Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CHOP silencing reduced number of apoptotic endothelial cells in BA, and increased BA diameter after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amelioration of CVS was associated with reduced neuronal injury in cerebral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CHOP siRNA treatment can effectively combat apoptotic mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> set in motion by subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
