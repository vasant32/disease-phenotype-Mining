<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research in this laboratory indicates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be responsible by leading to formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products (BOXes), so we investigated changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in vitro, and in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-SAH CSF, a source of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase I (HO-1), and blood were incubated, and in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> production measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid from SAH patients was collected, categorized using stimulation of vascular smooth muscle metabolism in vitro, and information obtained regarding occurrence of vasospasm in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral spinal fluid was analyzed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, total protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, BOXes, malonyldialdehyde and peroxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (indicators of an oxidizing environment), and HO-1 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in vitro requires that CSF is present, as well as whole, non-anti-coagulated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi>, BOXes, HO-1, and peroxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content were significantly higher in CSF from SAH patients with vasospasm, compared with nonvasospasm SAH CSF, and correlated with occurrence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that vasospasm may be more likely in patients with elevated BOXes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conditions necessary for the formation of BOXes are indeed present in CSF from SAH patients with vasospasm, but not CSF from SAH patients without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
