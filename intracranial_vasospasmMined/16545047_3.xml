<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival will ultimately depend on the severity of the haemorrhage, the subsequent loss of functional neurones and the extracranial reserve of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this regard, advances in neuroradiology and operative techniques together with expert neurocritical care and rehabilitation provide the best chances of short- and long- term survival respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, the contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> to attributable morbidity and mortality remains conjectural albeit real, and whilst medical anti-vasospastic therapies should be considered in vulnerable patients, they should be used with circumspection and caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is little or no evidence to justify the aggressive use of anti-vasospastic therapies as a preventative manner with exception of oral nimodipine in patients with low-grade aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
