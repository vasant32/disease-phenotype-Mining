<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytoskeletal changes in cultured vascular cells are sensitive indicators of oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells showed a dose-related disruption of the cytoskeleton, particularly the F-actin and vimentin filaments, when exposed to 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytoskeletal injury was prevented by the addition of 10(-3) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> or 1% albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These experiments support a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> in the pharmacological treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytoskeletal studies of cultured arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells provide a novel in vitro approach by which to study the cellular mechanisms of oxidant injury initiated by the breakdown products of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
