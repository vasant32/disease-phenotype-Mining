<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the clinicoangiographic correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a series of 120 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They made such correlation in the pre and postoperative course, in the follow-up, and in relation with the pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied with one to three angiographies in the pre and postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the clinical grading the authors have used the classification of Botterell modified by Hunt et al, and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the classification of Pool and Potts and Saito et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They found a good correlation between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the disorders of consciousness or motility, i.e. when both of them are considered separately, and only in patients with neurological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparing Botterell grade I and grades II-V, in 25% of the grade I patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was observed without neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was lower in grades II-V patients and the severity of the clinical picture was in relation with other factors such as <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors consider the possibility of a personal variability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in relation with a different susceptibility to the spasmogenic substances </plain></SENT>
