<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injections of autologous blood reduced the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> content of perivascular nerve endings and 3H-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These values returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in a period of two weeks after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-beta-hydroxylase was also reduced 3 and 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superior cervical gangliectomy and intracisternal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine also reduced these three parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The uptake of 45Ca2+ by arteries from animals submitted to SAH was greater than if the blood vessels were from untreated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lantanum brought about a less 45Ca2+ displacement in the arterial segments from untreated animals than in those from cats after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SAH induces a transient adrenergic denervation as well as changes in the membrane of smooth muscle cell which increase the quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> bound to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these modifications might be involved in the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that appears after SAH </plain></SENT>
