<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were examined with bilateral vertebral angiography or autoradiographic CBF- and CMRgI-studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A biphasic vasospasm was seen with a maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spasm at ten minutes and a maximal late spasm at two days post SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day two post SAH, CBF studies demonstrated focal low flow areas in the cortex and caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CMRgI examinations revealed focal areas with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> accumulation corresponding to the low flow areas, suggesting an anaerobic glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adrenal demedullation did not change the degree of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cranial sympathectomy reduced the degree of late spasm by about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesioning of the ascending CA pathways in the mesencephalon prior to the SAH, prevented the development of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and the late spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also prevented the development of the focal CBF and CMRgI changes </plain></SENT>
