<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Total Ca and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ in cerebrospinal fluid were measured from the patient with subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relationship was studied between the values of total Ca and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ and grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on cerebral angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, experimental studies were performed on helical strip of dogs' basilar arteries with constrictable substances such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), KC1 and oxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Oxy-Hb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings were as follows: There was a gradual increasing of vasospasm in the patients whose cerebrospinal fluid contained high values of total Ca at one or two days after rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples of bloody cerebrospinal fluid, values of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ were almost the same or lower than that of control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time course of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ concentrations was remarkably decreased in the groups with increased vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the experimental study, continuous constriction of helical strips were induced with high concentration of KC1 and physiological values of Oxy-Hb, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha constricted only in a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of KC1 and Oxy-Hb were remarkably inhibited when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ was freed from the fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With these results, it was thought that Oxy-Hb might be the most important substance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and it may affect cerebral vessels with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ in cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was, however, an unreasonable result that time course of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ decreased on the patients with severe vasospasm when vasospasm increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Then, high concentration of total Ca at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was considered as it may trigger the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
