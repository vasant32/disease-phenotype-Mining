<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, on cerebral artery contraction induced in vitro by the addition of whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole fresh arterial blood added to isolated rabbit basilar artery bathed in a physiological buffer produces a sustained contraction in vessels observed for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant dose-dependent inhibition of contraction was observed when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> was added to the vessel bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was not influenced by preincubating cerebral vessels with aspirin, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that inhibition of whole blood-induced cerebral artery contraction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> does not result from potentiation of cerebral vessel <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> pathways, but possibly from a direct effect on platelets </plain></SENT>
