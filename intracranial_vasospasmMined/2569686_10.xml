<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OKY-046 was administered in two daily doses of 80 mg (L group) and 400 mg (H group), and compared with a group given a placebo (P group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained: the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was significantly lower in the L group than in the P group; the development of low density area (LD) in CTs was significantly lower in both the L and H groups than in the P group; motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> in the L group improved significantly sooner, and that in the H group tended to improve sooner than that in the P group; in subjects with severe vasospasm, the incidence of LD was significantly lower, with better functional prognosis, in the L group than in the P group; in subjects with severe grades on the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS), Japan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (JCS) or High Density (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) Score the functional prognosis at 1 month after the aneurysmal rupture was significantly better in the L group than in the P group, though no significant differences were seen in the overall investigation; there were no significant differences among the three groups in the development of either laboratory-determined abnormality or of adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is thus concluded that OKY-046 is clinically useful at a dose of 80 mg/d for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and cerebral ischaemic symptoms after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) caused by aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
