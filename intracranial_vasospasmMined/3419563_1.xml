<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the intracellular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of cerebral arterial vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), we measured the activity of three protein kinases related to vascular smooth muscle function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase and cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase activity was determined in canine basilar arteries using the SAH model created by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was confirmed angiographically 7 days after the first injection of blood, with a mean decrease in the diameter of the basilar artery to 61.2 +/- 2.3% (SE) of preinjection controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic analysis of basilar arteries excised from control dogs and from SAH model dogs 2 to 10 days after an intracisternal injection of blood demonstrated detectable MLCK and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MLCK activity was approximately 3 times higher than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in basilar artery protein kinase activity between control animals and SAH model animals at any time for up to 10 days after the intracisternal injection of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As MLCK is involved with smooth muscle contraction and cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in smooth muscle relaxation, our results suggest that the metabolic machinery of vascular smooth muscle in the cerebral arterial wall is intact after SAH and that prolonged vasospasm represents an appropriate physiological response by the vascular smooth muscle to external stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If this is correct, the successful pharmacological manipulation of vasospasm after SAH is more likely than if profound disruption had occurred, and further investigative efforts in this area should be encouraged </plain></SENT>
