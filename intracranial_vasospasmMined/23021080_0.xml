<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) is an often devastating form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aside from the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, cardiac complications can occur resulting in neurogenic stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NCM), leading to impaired cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether aSAH patients with NCM had poorer long term functional outcomes than patients without NCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality, vasospasm, and delayed ischemic complications were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted for aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) from January 2006 to June 2011 (n=299) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients who underwent an echocardiogram were identified (n=120) and were assigned to the NCM (n=49) category based on echocardiographic findings defined by a depressed ejection fraction (EF%) along with a regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) in a non-vascular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures included in-hospital mortality and functional outcomes as measured by the Modified Barthel Index (mBI) at 3 months and one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary analysis determined if there was an association between NCM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 16% of aSAH patients developed NCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was higher (p&lt;.001) in the NCM group (n=23[46.9%]) than in the non-CM group (n=28[11.2%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with NCM had poorer functional outcomes as measured by the mBI at both 3 months (p=.002) and 12 months (p=.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Hunt-Hess score was predictive of functional outcome as measured by the mBI at both 3 months (p=.002) as well as at 1 year (p=.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NCM was associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p=.047 CI, 1.012-7.288) and vasospasm (p=.008 CI, 1.34-6.66) after correction for Hunt-Hess grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tobacco use (p&lt;.001) and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (p&lt;.009) were also associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NCM was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (p=.047) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NCM is seen in a substantial number of aSAH patients and when present, it is associated with higher mortality and poorer long-term functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This finding may guide further prospective studies in order to determine if early recognition of NCM as well as optimization of cardiac output would improve mortality </plain></SENT>
