<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that upregulation of haem oxygenase (HO-1) is induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and results in release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> (BR), which are scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report biomimetic studies aimed at modelling pathological conditions leading to oxidative degradation of BR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidative degradation products of BR, formed by reaction with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (an ROS model system), demonstrated biological activity by stimulating oxygen consumption and force development in vascular smooth muscle from porcine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analogous biological activity was observed with vasoactive cerebrospinal fluid from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms of oxidative degradation of BR are discussed </plain></SENT>
