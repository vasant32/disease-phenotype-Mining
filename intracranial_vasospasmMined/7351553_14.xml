<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was made of 195 patients who had ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> without significant intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> and who recovered to at least Grade III by Hunt and Hess' classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first 121 patients underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery 10 days to 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) without repeat preoperative angiography and without special attention to volume replacement or avoidance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in 15% of this group, more than half of these postoperatively, and was treated successfully in half the patients with a combination of aminophylline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The later 74 patients were managed with aggressive maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulating blood volume and preoperative angiography at 2 weeks following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If significant vasospasm persisted on angiography, surgery was delayed an additional week and, if spasm was still present then, aminophylline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> was added prophylactically to aggressive volume replacement before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this second group of patients, the incidence of clinical vasospasm was essentially unchanged; however, it was almost completely limited to the preoperative period, and was more effectively treated with aminophylline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative vasospasm was almost completely eliminated from the second group of patients </plain></SENT>
