<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The current clinical prospective randomized phase II study was initiated in order to analyze the effect of enhanced washout by discontinuous intraventricular thrombolysis in combination with low-frequency head-motion therapy on side effects, clot clearance rate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and clinical outcome after severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 40 adult patients with aneurysmal SAH were included in this interim analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized to the study group achieved additional intraventricular application of rt-PA (Actilyse(®)) bolus 5 mg every 12 h and lateral rotational therapy (RotoRest(®)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clot clearance rate was evaluated based on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) and early clinical outcome of patients were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No severe side effects due to the combined therapy were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clot clearance rate was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group regarding the cranial and basal CT slices (p = 0.003 cranial slices and p = 0.037 basal slices) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) were increased in the control group (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that a combination of intraventricular thrombolysis and lateral rotational therapy is not associated with a higher complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the therapy leads to a significant acceleration of the clot clearance rate </plain></SENT>
