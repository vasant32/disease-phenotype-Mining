<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BA vasospasm was sequentially assessed at 1, 2, and 3 h, and 1-6 days after SAH by BB-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BB-MRI clearly visualized biphasic vasospasm; early vasospasm at 1 h later and the maximal DCV at day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol was perorally administered twice at day 1 after having confirmed significant DCV using BB-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of cilostazol on DCV was evaluated at day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol significantly attenuated DCV and suppressed the levels of malondialdehide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> in CSF after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that BB-MRI is a useful and less invasive method for the evaluation of DCV, and cilostazol may be effective on DCV </plain></SENT>
