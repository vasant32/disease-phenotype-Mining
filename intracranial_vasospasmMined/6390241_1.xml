<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lipoperoxide contents of the arterial wall was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructual examination was carried out to reveal morphological localization of lipoperoxide of the spastic artery by a new method of lipoperoxide stain using thiocarbohydrazide and silver protein, the former was considered to react malondialdehyde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lipoperoxide appeared in the electron microscope as discrete black granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of lipoperoxide content of the spastic arterial wall elevated up to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing with the control group, the increasing lipoperoxide contents of both day 4 SAH group and oxyHb induced group showed statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> biosynthetic activity in SAH group and in oxyHb induced group diminished, but statistically there was no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> biosynthetic activity did not alter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With increasing lipoperoxide value of arterial wall their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> biosynthetic activity tended to diminish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive staining products of lipoperoxide stain were noted along the cell membrane of smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell in spastic arteries of both SAH and oxyHb induced groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The result of this study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> associated with lysis of the subarachnoid clot initiates <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation damage of the smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell which diminishes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
