<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used dynamic digital subtraction angiography (dynamic DSA) to measure local transit time before and after endovascular treatment (EVT) for the treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and delayed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) was measured by dynamic DSA in 19 patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and delayed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and 6 patients without symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (group III) just after surgery, immediately prior to EVT, just after EVT, and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of disease more than 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EVT included <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> using a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> nondetachable balloon and/or superselective infusion of 0.2% papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic vasospasm occurred between days 7 and 11 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> just after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> in these 10 patients with complete neurologic recovery during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of disease (group I) and the other 9 patients without complete recovery (group II) were respectively 6.92 +/- 0.42 seconds and 7.66 +/- 0.78 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter value was significantly larger than the former (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> just after EVT in group II were also significantly greater than the corresponding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in group I (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, immediately prior to EVT the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in group I and group II was significantly longer than that in group III (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Functional analysis with dynamic DSA can be used to detect hemodynamic disturbances, and can be used for hemodynamic evaluation during the treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
