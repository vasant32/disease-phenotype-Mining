<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite rigorous efforts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive their initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases of intracranial ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with vasospasm, we evaluated the effectiveness of combined embolization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and intra-arterial infusion of nimodipine, which continued during the entire procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and METHODS: Ten patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with vasospasm who were treated in a single session were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After initial intra-arterial infusion of nimodipine (1-2 mg within 10-15 minutes), they underwent occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with coils under continuous intra-arterial infusion of nimodipine at a dose of 1 mg per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiography showed severe proximal vasospasm in 1 patient, proximal and distal in 3 patients, and distal in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also moderate proximal vasospasm in 4 patients, proximal and distal in 1 patient, and distal in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was achieved in 5 patients, incomplete occlusion in 3 patients, and a small neck remnant in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final angiograms also demonstrated complete clearance of a proximal spasm in 4 patients, and complete clearance of proximal and distal spasms in another 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean initial dose of nimodipine was 1.375 mg, and mean continuous infusion dose was 1.275 mg (mean total dose, 2.65 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No medical complications related to extended infusion of nimodipine occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small series, extended intra-arterial infusion of nimodipine up to the end of the embolization procedure was effective and safe in patients with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and associated vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This technique seems to increase the security of the procedure as well as force further vasorelaxation when the endovascular route is used to treat both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and vasospasm in a single step </plain></SENT>
