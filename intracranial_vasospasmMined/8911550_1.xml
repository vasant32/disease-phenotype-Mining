<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four hours after the application of blood, the constriction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> was significantly enhanced, while that to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> was significantly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absolute value in the decrease of perfusion pressure for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>-induced constriction sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> was much greater after the blood application than that before the application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the augmentation of cerebrovascular responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in the early stage immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) might be mediated by 5-HT2 receptors at least in part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This early constrictor mechanism may be implicated in the aetiology of the following late stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
