<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was originally identified as a potent vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous reports have suggested its roles in various disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there is a great deal of evidence establishing the relationship between ET-1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in animals, this relationship still remains to be clarified in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The concentration of ET-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured by radioimmunoassay in 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were collected every 10 days after surgery from the cisternal drainage tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial concentrations of ET-1 in the CSF collected the first day after operation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased compared with the control CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In seven of the eight vasospasm patients, the concentrations of ET-1 had increased before the observation of vasospasm and then decreased before the disappearance of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 out of the 15 patients without vasospasm, the concentrations of ET-1 in CSF decreased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the concentration of ET-1 in CSF increased before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ET-1 concentration in the CSF could be a useful marker to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
