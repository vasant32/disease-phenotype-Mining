<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">Preeclampsia</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complication of pregnancy</z:e> that causes maternal vasoconstriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease may progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, which is thought to be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there is evidence for more than one circulating factor that causes endothelial cell dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, little work has focused on the possibility that vascular smooth muscle function might be directly stimulated by a circulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether such a factor or factors could be detected by the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Excessive vascular smooth muscle oxygen consumption was used as a screen for metabolic stimulation because pathologic arterial constriction would require oxidative metabolism to generate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>De-endothelialized porcine carotid artery (a well-validated model of human arterial contractile function) was exposed to sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (1:30 dilution) in a sealed chamber with an oxygen electrode, and the rate of oxygen consumption by the tissue was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with the effects of sera from matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant patients and from nonpregnant women were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure of vascular smooth muscle to sera from women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> for 90 minutes resulted in greater oxygen consumption by the tissue (0.66 +/- 0.16 micromol O2 /min per gram of dry weight) than did exposure to sera of matched pregnant and nonpregnant control subjects (0.34 +/- 0.08 micromol O2 /min per gram of dry weight, P &lt;.001, and 0.29 +/- 0.03 micromol O2 /min per gram of dry weight, P &lt;.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This stimulation was completely reversed by rinsing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a factor in the circulation of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> that has the reversible effect on vascular smooth muscle of accelerating oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We discuss the implications of this observation in terms of known aspects of vascular smooth muscle contractile function </plain></SENT>
