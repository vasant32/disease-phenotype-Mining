<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased vascular reactiveness has an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the roles of the receptor-mediated signaling and the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in the increased vascular reactiveness in SAH, using the basilar artery of a rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1, thrombin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> induced transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i), myosin light chain phosphorylation, and contraction in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these responses were not only enhanced but also became sustained in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the sequential stimulation of thrombin receptor or alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, the second response was substantially attenuated in the controls, whereas it was maintained in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The thrombin-induced contraction in SAH irreversibly persisted even after terminating the thrombin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This contraction was completely reversed by trypsin and a Galpha(q) inhibitor YM254890, thus suggesting the sustained receptor activity during the sustained contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>YM254890 also inhibited the endothelin-1- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced sustained contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43000">GTPgammaS</z:chebi>-induced transient contraction in the control alpha-toxin-permeabilized strips was converted to a sustained contraction in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results provide the first evidence that the feedback inactivation of the receptor activity and the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was impaired in SAH, thus contributing to the increased vascular reactiveness </plain></SENT>
