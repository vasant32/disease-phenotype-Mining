<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rho-kinase is involved in such processes as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, smooth muscle contraction, and formation of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> fibers, as revealed using inhibitor Y-27632 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined the crystal structures of HA-1077, H-1152P, and Y-27632 in complexes with protein kinase A (PKA) as a surrogate kinase to analyze Rho-kinase inhibitor binding properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Features conserved between PKA and Rho-kinase are involved in the key binding interactions, while a combination of residues at the ATP binding pocket that are unique to Rho-kinase may explain the inhibitors' Rho-kinase selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, a second H-1152P binding site potentially points toward PKA regulatory domain interaction modulators </plain></SENT>
