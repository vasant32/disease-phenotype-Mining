<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies of the effects of the calcium channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> on angiographic vasospasm have yielded mixed and/or qualitative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, improvement in angiographic vasospasm after intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> administration is demonstrated with quantitative, blinded methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational case series includes 12 patients with vasospasm after SAH who collectively received 16 treatments with intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> during a 2-year period at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exclusion criterion was concurrent treatment with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blinded reviewers quantitatively evaluated angiograms from each patient and/or treatment after presentation with SAH and before and after intra-arterial treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were treated with intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> for vasospasm 9 ± 4 days after SAH with a range from 1 to 16 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 34 arterial distributions treated, the segment with the worst angiographic vasospasm from each arterial distribution averaged 51 ± 13% stenosis, which improved to 29 ± 18% stenosis (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in treatment effect in proximal arterial segments, which may be amenable to angioplasty, compared with distal segments (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in treatment effect in arterial segments previously subjected to angioplasty compared with other segments (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterially administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> improves angiographic vasospasm after SAH when administered at 10 ± 3 mg per arterial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimal dose, infusion rate, and retreatment interval remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove efficacy in the treatment of clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
