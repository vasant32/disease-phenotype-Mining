<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experimental protocol was detailed in Part 1 of this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 30 monkeys studied from both groups (one receiving placebo and the other nimodipine) underwent cerebral fixation (Day 14) at controlled pressure by intra-arterial perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arteries at the base of the brain were studied by light microscopy and scanning (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography on Day 7 showed that vasospasm was significantly more common (p less than 0.0001) and more severe (p less than 0.01) on the clot side compared to the control or non-clot side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was less severe on Day 14, just before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 80% of the 20 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) specimens that had been in spasm (Day 7) showed marked corrugation , and in some the endothelium had a fish-scale appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 10 MCA's on the clot side examined by TEM that had been in spasm (Day 7) showed marked changes such as endothelial swelling, subendothelial proliferation, corrugation of the elastic lamina, and myonecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With few exceptions, none of the basilar arteries or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s on the non-clot (control) side showed any abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathological findings of vessels in spasm were considered to be slightly less severe in the nimodipine group; however, the trial drug (1 mg/kg/8 hrs) did not prevent such abnormalities from occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural changes in the arterial walls of specimens from both placebo and nimodipine groups in vasospasm are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since dramatic changes are present in the vessel walls even after radiologically visible vasospasm has almost completely abated, we believe that vasospasm is due to long-lasting smooth-muscle constriction and not to vessel wall thickening caused by a cellular or subcellular infiltrate </plain></SENT>
