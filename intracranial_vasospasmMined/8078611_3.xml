<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased frequency of HLA antigen A31 and a significantly decreased frequency of HLA antigen B40 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) following aneurysmal SAH and HLA typing, HLA-Bw60 antigen showed significant increases; in patients who did not develop HLA-Aw33 and -Cw4 antigens showed significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with Fisher's Group 3 on CT, in particular, these antigens significantly increased when compared with controls from the same geographic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HLA-Bw60 antigen plays a role as predisposing factor of DIND resulting from vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH, and that HLA-Aw33 and -Cw4 exert protective influence against DIND </plain></SENT>
