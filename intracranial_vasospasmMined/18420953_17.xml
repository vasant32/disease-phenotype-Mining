<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty (pTBA) appeared to prevent delayed ischemic neurological deficit in a pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase II multicenter randomized clinical trial was subsequently designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventy patients with Fisher Grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 85 patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent pTBA within 96 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main end points of the study included the 3-month dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), development of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND), occurrence of Transcranial Doppler (TCD) vasospasm, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of DIND was lower in the pTBA group (P=0.30) and fewer patients required therapeutic angioplasty to treat DIND (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall pTBA resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 5.9% and a relative risk reduction of 10.4% unfavorable outcome (P=0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good grade patients had absolute and relative risk reductions of respectively 9.5 and 29.4% (P=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Length of stay in ICU and hospital was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a procedure-related vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, of which three patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While the trial is unsuccessful as defined by the primary end point (GOS), proof of concept is confirmed by these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients tend to develop vasospasm after treatment with pTBA and there is a statistically significantly decreased need for therapeutic angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>pTBA does not improve the poor outcome of patients with Fisher grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
