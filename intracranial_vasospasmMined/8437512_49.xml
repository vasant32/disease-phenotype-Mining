<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH induced by injection of autologous blood in the cisterna magna reduced by 22 to 38% cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with radioactive microspheres at 30, 60 and 120 min after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48545">pentapeptide</z:chebi> BQ-123, a selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of the <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor, injected intravenously (3 mg/kg) had no effect on this decrease in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, intracisternal BQ-123 (10 nmol) completely prevented the decrease in CBF at 60 and 120 min after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BQ-123 does not cross the blood-brain barrier, but demonstrate that endothelin acting on <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor plays a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasoconstriction in this rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
