<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently found block of NO synthase in rat middle cerebral artery caused spasm, associated with depolarizing oscillations in membrane potential (E(m)) similar in form but faster in frequency (circa 1 Hz) to vasomotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels contribute to cerebral myogenic tone and vasomotion, so we investigated the significance of T-type and other ion channels for membrane potential oscillations underlying arterial spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle cell membrane potential (E(m)) and tension were measured simultaneously in rat middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NO synthase blockade caused temporally coupled depolarizing oscillations in cerebrovascular E(m) with associated vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both events were accentuated by block of smooth muscle BK(Ca) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Block of T-type channels or inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase abolished the oscillations in E(m) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003026'>reduced vasoconstriction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oscillations in E(m) were either attenuated or accentuated by reducing [Ca(2+)](o) or block of K(V), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TRAM-34 attenuated oscillations in both E(m) and tone, apparently independent of effects against K(Ca)3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, rapid depolarizing oscillations in E(m) and tone observed after endothelial function has been disrupted reflect input from T-type calcium channels in addition to L-type channels, while other depolarizing currents appear to be unimportant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that combined block of T and L-type channels may represent an effective approach to reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
