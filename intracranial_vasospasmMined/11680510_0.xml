<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, membrane-bound tissue factor (mTF) and myelin basic protein (MBP) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were evaluated as a predictor of the time of occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mTF and MBP concentrations were measured in the CSF from 28 patients with SAH due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial assays were performed from day 4 to day 14 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF mTF and MBP concentrations from days 5 to 9 correlated with the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to vasospasm and outcome three months after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the serial assays, CSF mTF measurements predicted the time of occurrence and severity and irreversibility of symptoms due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CSF mTF is predictive of the occurrence and the recovery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, while CSF MBP is only an indicator of severity of brain damage due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
