<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s) on the clot side <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed angiographic vasospasm, which was maximal 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at this time and vascular responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 were studied in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> rings from the clot (spastic) side and the non-clot (control) side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control preparations with an intact endothelium, which had been precontracted by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> and A23187 produced significant relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> and A23187 did not relax vascular tissues in which the endothelium had been mechanically removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> did not produce a significant endothelium-dependent relaxation of primate <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> rings, but did relax rings of primate common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with chlorpheniramine (an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37955">H1-receptor antagonist</z:chebi>) prevented <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-induced relaxation; however, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> (an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonist</z:chebi>) had no inhibitory action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It thus seems that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> mediates relaxation of intact <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s mostly by an H1-receptor-mediated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relaxations induced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> and A23187 in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s from the clot side were substantially reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the small component of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-induced relaxation was also abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-independent relaxation induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN) occurred in arteries from both the control and the clot sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Constrictions induced by KC1 and PGF2 alpha were reduced on the clot side of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> influences both the generation of EDRF and the constriction of affected arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The small contraction which was elicited in spastic arteries was fully relaxed by GTN </plain></SENT>
