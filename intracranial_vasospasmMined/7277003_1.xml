<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the changes induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on the contractile responses and the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> release evoked in cat cerebral arteries by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose-dependent vasoconstriction induced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> on the cerebral arteries of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cats was significantly reduced by diphenhydramine and phentolamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When SAH was produced 3 and 7 days before the experiment, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction also decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a tendency to normalization in the contractile vascular responses was observed such that in 15 days after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> it was not significantly different from that found in controls animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> provoked by SAH was similar to that seen after pretreatment with intracisternal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of radioactivity released by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> following preincubation with 3H-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> from the cerebral arteries of cats exposed to SAH 3, 7, and 15 days before the experiment was significantly reduced when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the basal level of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29298">tritium</z:chebi> release and the radioactivity retained at the end of the experiment were also decreased after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These decreases were less marked 15 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine 3, 7, and 15 days prior to the assay, and the removal of both superior cervical ganglia 15 days before the experiment, also markedly reduced these three parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> releases <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> from cat cerebral arteries, and SAH produces a transient denervation of the perivascular adrenergic nerve endings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction observed after SAH might be explained by the impairment of the indirect adrenergic mechanism involved in the overall contractile response elicited by this <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to the present findings, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> does not seem to play a significant role in the production of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurring after SAH </plain></SENT>
