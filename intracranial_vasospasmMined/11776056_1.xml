<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the preventive effects of single use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and its combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A canine model of the "double <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)" was established to study the angiogram characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and its combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> on the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CVS were observed in a randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and pathological changes in the basilar artery (BA) wall were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results were obtained on the 7th day after subcarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> group, the BA diameter was 87% +/- 26% of the original BA diameter, and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content of BA wall was 0.03 +/- 0.01 nmol/mg tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> group, it was 93% +/- 20% (BA diameter) and 0.02 +/- 0.01 nmol/mg tissue (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the BA diameter was 53% +/- 19% and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content was 0.11 +/- 0.05 nmol/mg tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination confirmed the reduction in BA wall damage in the experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> has a preventive effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CVS following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may suppress the production of free radicals and reduce damage to the BA wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> allows lower dosage and less complication compared with a single agent, and results in a better outcome </plain></SENT>
