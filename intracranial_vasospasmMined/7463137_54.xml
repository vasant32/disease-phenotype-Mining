<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 15-HPAA was injected into the cisterna magna (0.2 or 2 mg emulsified in bovine serum albumin solution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in diameter of the basilar artery were followed by angiography, and the morphological changes were studied by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cisternal injection of 0.2 mg of 15-HPAA caused a mild constriction of the basilar artery which lasted about 7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cisternal injection of 2 mg of 15-HPAA caused a biphasic constriction, the initial phase of which was a moderate narrowing lasting about 10 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second phase started on the 2nd or the 3rd day after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the arterial narrowing was more pronounced in the second phase than in the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prolonged secondary constriction of the basilar artery continued until sacrifice on the 7th day after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic study revealed a marked degenerative change in the endothelium and myonecrotic changes in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prolonged arterial constriction in the second phase was invariably associated with remarkable degeneration of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, myonecrotic changes were limited to a small number of smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study are consonant with the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation associated with lysis of the subarachnoid clot is involved in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
