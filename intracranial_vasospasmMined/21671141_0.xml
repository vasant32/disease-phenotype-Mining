<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduced availability of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is well established as a key mechanism of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor also known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>, has failed to be established in clinical settings to prevent vasospasm because of its adverse effects, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of intrathecally administered GTN on vasospasm after experimental SAH in the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH in rabbits was used to induce vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GTN (0.5 mg/ml) or saline was infused via a subcutaneous implanted osmotic pump with continuous drug release into the cerebellomedullary cistern over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm in the basilar artery was recorded with angiography on day 5 after SAH and was compared to baseline angiography on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Significant reduction of basilar artery diameter was observed in the SAH group with saline infusion compared to sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrathecally administered GTN had no effect on the vessel diameter in sham-operated animals, whereas it significantly prevented vasospasm in the SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal GTN infusion did not affect arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic, continuous intrathecal administration of GTN prevents vasospasm of the basilar artery in the rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No toxic effects could be demonstrated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical safety and feasibility of this strategy need to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
