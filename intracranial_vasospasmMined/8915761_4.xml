<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm was 3-7 days after surgery; three of the patients died of an ischemic event induced by the vasospasm and two survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although no angiographic confirmation was obtained in our cases, serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocities were always high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the TCD-revealed accumulation of blood in the basal cisterns observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases may have been responsible for this unusual condition, and it is therefore important to consider vasospasm as a probable etiological cause of clinical deterioration in patients undergoing the surgical removal of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this reason, whenever any neurological deterioration occurs in such patients, it is advisable to perform TCD in order to verify the presence of any vasospasm and promptly commence suitable treatment </plain></SENT>
