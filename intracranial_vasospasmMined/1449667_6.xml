<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unilateral postganglionic lesion caused a significant constriction of about 27% of the ipsilateral cerebral arteries, while a preganglionic lesion did not change the baseline arterial diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) the degree of vasoconstriction in the animals with a preganglionic lesion did not differ significantly from that seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the postganglionically lesioned animals, the vasoconstriction was more pronounced (12% at both 10 min and 6 days post SAH) on the lesioned as compared with the non-lesioned side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 6 post SAH the degree of vasoconstriction was 19% more pronounced on the lesioned side in post- as compared with the preganglionically lesioned animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the degree of spasm on the non-lesioned side between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that the trigeminal system has both a peripheral and a central function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peripheral, or axon reflex mechanism, exerts a tonic effect on the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
