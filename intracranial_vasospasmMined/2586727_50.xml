<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was created in 12 monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only the right (clot-side) cerebral arteries developed angiographic vasospasm (VSP), which was maximal 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight animals were killed at this time and the remainder at 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of killing the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) were harvested, and four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, left (non-clot-side) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were vasoconstricted in vitro with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in maximal VSP 7 days from SAH were undistinguishable on scanning electron microscopy from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries vasoconstricted in vitro: both groups demonstrated a mean 57% reduction in vessel caliber and a 5-fold increase in vessel wall thickness compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, nonvasoconstricted left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On transmission electron microscopy, however, arteries in SAH-induced VSP showed degenerative changes in the tunica intima and media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were still evident at 14 days, despite considerable resolution of VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings, as well as those from other pathological studies of animal and human cerebral arteries in VSP, suggest that the arterial narrowing and vessel wall thickening seen within several weeks of SAH is due primarily to medial contraction, but unlike simple vasoconstriction, is associated with degenerative ultrastructural changes in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells which may denote a temporarily irreversible state </plain></SENT>
