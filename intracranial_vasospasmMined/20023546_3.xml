<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35545">bipyridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50568">phosphodiesterase III inhibitor</z:chebi>, is a potent member of the inodilator class of cardiac agents for vasospasm and is injected intra-arterially or intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been no studies investigating the duration of action (context-sensitive half-life) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> for vasospasm or the most effective route of administration (intra-arterial versus intracisternal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of intracisternal and intra-arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary isometric tension study of canine vasospastic basilar arteries, the vasodilatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> were examined 7 days after an initial injection of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> was injected intracisternally (0.1 mg, 0.47 mmol/L) or intra-arterially (0.3 mg/kg, 1.2 mmol/L), and angiograms were performed 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes later on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> produced concentration-dependent vasodilation and was effective intracisternally, resulting in significant dilation until 180 minutes after injection and a tendency for dilation until 240 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of intra-arterial injection was not as significant compared with an intracisternal injection, resulting in significant dilation only at 180 minutes after intra-arterial injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracisternal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> was more effective than intra-arterial injection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in dogs because intracisternal injection produced a higher concentration in vasospastic arteries (0.034-0.068 mmol/L intracisternally versus 0.016 mmol/L intra-arterially) </plain></SENT>
