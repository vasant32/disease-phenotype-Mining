<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">Leukotriene</z:chebi> (LT) C4, LTD4, and LTE4 were purified from incubated basilar artery, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, median eminence, and blood clot from around the basilar artery using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the amount of each LT was quantified separately by bioassay with guinea pig ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biosynthetic capacity for total LTs was approximately three times higher in the hypothalamus and median eminence than in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata in the eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the biosynthetic capacity was increased significantly both before and 2 hours after the second injection of blood on Day 2 and was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on Day 7 in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata, whereas the biosynthetic capacity was decreased significantly 2 hours after the first and second injections of blood and was increased significantly on Day 7 in the hypothalamus and median eminence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In blood clot the biosynthetic capacity was increased continuously after the first injection of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the biosynthetic capacity for total LTs showed a time- and tissue-specific change after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
