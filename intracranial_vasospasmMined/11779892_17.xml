<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous studies have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is one of the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and neurological disability after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies, however, have focused on anterior circulation vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of the transcranial Doppler (TCD), increasing attention has been given to basilar artery (BA) vasospasm, especially in traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As shown for the anterior circulation, however, the significance of elevated flow velocities (FVs) in the posterior vessels may be ambiguous, so vasospasm may not be reliably differentiated from hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential additional value of an intracranial/extracranial FV ratio in the posterior circulation to cope with this shortcoming of the TCD in the diagnosis of BA vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FV in the extracranial vertebral artery (VA) was measured in 20 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normative values of an intracranial/extracranial VA FV ratio (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>/EVA) and a BA/extracranial VA FV ratio (BA/EVA) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were then evaluated with TCD and CT angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>/EVA and BA/EVA ratios in the diagnosis and assessment of vertebrobasilar vasospasm was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extracranial VA could be insonated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects at depths ranging from 45 to 55 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average FV for the extracranial VA was 26 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratios between intracranial and extracranial VA FVs were 1.6 on both sides, whereas the ratio between the BA FVs and the mean extracranial VA FVs was slightly higher at 1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (41.2%) had CTA evidence of BA vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was severe in 7 patients, moderate in 1, and mild in the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An FV threshold of 80 cm/s was indicative of BA vasospasm in 92.8% with 3 false-positive results that could be related to vertebrobasilar hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis between CTA and TCD findings showed that BA/EVA was &gt;2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BA vasospasm (100% sensitivity) and &lt; 2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient without BA vasospasm (95% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the BA/EVA ratio showed a close correlation with BA diameter (r=-0.8139, P&lt;0.0001) and was &gt;3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the BA/EVA ratio may contribute to an improved discrimination between BA vasospasm and vertebrobasilar hyperemia and enhance the accuracy and reliability of TCD in the diagnosis of BA vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our data further suggest that the BA/EVA ratio may provide an approximation of vasospasm severity and help in identifying patients who are likely to suffer from hemodynamically significant vasospasm </plain></SENT>
