<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When several independent groups have conducted studies to estimate a procedure's success rate, it is often of interest to combine the results of these studies in the hopes of obtaining a better estimate for the true unknown success rate of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we present two hierarchical methods for estimating the overall rate of success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both methods take into account the within-study and between-study variation and assume in the first stage that the number of successes within each study follows a binomial distribution given each study's own success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They differ, however, in their second stage assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first method assumes in the second stage that the rates of success from individual studies form a random sample having a constant expected value and variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are then used to estimate the overall rate of success and its variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second method assumes in the second stage that the success rates from different studies follow a beta distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both methods use the maximum likelihood approach to derive an estimate for the overall success rate and to construct the corresponding confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also present a two-stage bootstrap approach to estimating a confidence interval for the success rate when the number of studies is small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We then perform a simulation study to compare the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we illustrate these two methods and obtain bootstrap confidence intervals in a medical example analysing the effectiveness of hyperdynamic therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
