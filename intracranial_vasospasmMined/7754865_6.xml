<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to predict the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after aneurysmal surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, we measured the amount of subarachnoid blood on initial and on postoperative computed tomograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a reliable grading method to estimate the amount of blood on computed tomograms in 24 patients with infarction due to vasospasm and 45 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom underwent aneurysmal surgery within 48 hours after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total amount of subarachnoid blood on admission and on the day after operation was more in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group than in the non-infarction group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clearance rate of subarachnoid blood by surgery was lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> than in patients without infarction and the predominant site of subarachnoid blood corresponded with the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 24 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 22 (92%) belonged to the group whose initial total blood score was more than 10 on admission and whose clearance rate by surgery was less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose this range to be an indication for the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in postoperative patients due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of intracerebral haematoma and the amount of ventricular blood and their clearance by surgery were also estimated for the prediction of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after aneurysmal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they had no relation to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
