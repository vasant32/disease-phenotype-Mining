<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is a major cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and extracellular Cal++ influx plays an essential role in ET-1-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors recently demonstrated that ET-1 activates two types of Ca"-permeable nonselective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels (designated NSCC-1 and NSCC-2) and a store-operated Cal++ channel (SOCC) in vascular smooth-muscle cells located in the basilar arteries (BAs) of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, they investigate the effects of phospholipase C (PLC) on ET-1-induced activation of these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channels and BA contraction by using the PLC inhibitor U73122 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine which Cal++ channels are activated via a PLC-dependent pathway, these investigators monitored the intracellular free Cal++ concentration ([<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of PLC in ET-1-induced vascular contraction was examined by performing a tension study of rabbit BA rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The U73122 inhibited the ET-1-induced transient increase in [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i, which resulted from mobilization of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ from the intracellular store </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phospholipase C also inhibited ET-1-induced extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2, but not through the NSCC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The U73122 inhibited the ET-1-induced contraction of the rabbit BA rings, which depended on extracellular Cal++ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(1) The SOCC and NSCC-2 are stimulated by ET-1 via a PLC-dependent cascade whereas NSCC-1 is stimulated via a PLC-independent cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) The PLC is involved in the ET-1-induced contraction of rabbit BA rings, which depends on extracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2 </plain></SENT>
