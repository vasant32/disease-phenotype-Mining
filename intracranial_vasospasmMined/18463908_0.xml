<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six dogs were assigned to two groups of three animals: control and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects were assessed by the changes in gene expressions in the artery 7 days after the first blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 23,914 genes, 447 and 66 genes were up-regulated more than two- and fivefold, respectively, and 332 and 25 genes were down-regulated more than two- and fivefold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to gene ontology, genes related to cell communication (P = 5.28E-10), host-pathogen interaction (7.65E-8), and defense-immunity protein activity (0.000183) were significantly overrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The top high-level function for the merged network derived from the network-based analysis was cell signaling, revealing that the subgroup that regulates the quantity of Ca(2+) to have the strongest association significance (P = 4.75E-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Canine microarray analysis followed by gene ontology profiling and connectivity analysis identified several functional groups and individual genes responding to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) regulation may play a key role in these gene expression changes and may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
