<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administrations of 2, 5 or 10 mu/kg/minute of OKY-046 were given continuously from the earliest possible day to the 14th SAH-day to 82 patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients (83%) showed moderate to high high-density (SAH) in their initial CTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasms were seen in 58 patients, representing 71% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases or 81% of the 72 cases for which angiograms were available: the vasospasms of 45 patients (55 or 63%) were moderate to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred, however, only in 27 patients (33%): in 18 of those cases, moreover, the symptoms were mild or transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conditions of the patients at one month after the SAH were classified into 9 grades from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 8 (deceased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients (63%) were classified as 0 or 1, and 64 (78%) as better than 3 (possible daily life unaided) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administration of OKY-046 was proven to decrease <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper emphasizes the effectiveness of the drug for symptomatic vasospasm, and supports our previous contention that cerebral microthrombosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
