<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro chamber studies have shown that both dog and human large cerebral artery segments contract to a variety of vasoactive agents, and the dog and human segments are remarkedly similar in their responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The source of calcium necessary to initiate contraction was found to be extracellular for large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, systemic arteries such as the femoral artery use a bound intracellular pool of calcium for contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and nimodipine were found to selectively inhibit the contractions of large cerebral arteries but not the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo experiments demonstrated that both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and nimodipine, given sublingually, would prevent and reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> in the dog after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine was found to be more potent, both in the chamber and in the live dog experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine significantly decreased the occurrence of severe neurologic deficits from spasm alone in a multi-institutional, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
