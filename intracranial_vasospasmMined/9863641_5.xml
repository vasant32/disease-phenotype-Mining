<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cerebral arterial rings precontracted with OxyHb (10 microM), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> caused a concentration-dependent decrease in isometric tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EC50s for the relaxation were 0.46+/-0.1 mM (n=6), 0.53+/-0.08 mM (n=12), 1.6+/-0.3 mM (n=7) and 3.9+/-0.5 mM (n=5) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi>, gentamicin, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This order of potency corresponds approximately to the number of positive charges in the molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> also inhibited the contractions to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> (1 microM) and depolarizing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> (60 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The order of potency was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> &gt; gentamicin &gt; <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi> &gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relaxation was maintained in vascular preparations denuded of endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">Neomycin</z:chebi> (5 mM) abolished the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-independent contraction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Fura-2-loaded cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, OxyHb (1 microM) significantly enhanced the concentration of intracellular calcium ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) by 330% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi>, gentamicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi> in concentrations corresponding to the EC50 from contractility studies, reduced the effects of OxyHb on [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i by about 50% to 221+/-35 nM (n=7), 270+/-31 nM (n=7), 229+/-33 nM (n = 6) and 240+/-6 nM (n = 5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggests that the effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> on the OxyHb-induced contraction and the long-term increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i, may arise from several effects, including inhibition of PLC, protection of calcium extrusion mechanisms, and interference with the process of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i accumulation </plain></SENT>
