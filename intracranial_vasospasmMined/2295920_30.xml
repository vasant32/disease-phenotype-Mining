<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of clot removal on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was studied in 104 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The series included patients who fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the ictus; the patient's preoperative clinical grade was between Grades I and IV; there was no rebleeding; computerized tomography (CT) showed only SAH; and carotid angiograms were performed by Day 2 and repeated between Days 7 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the degree of SAH on CT and angiographic vasospasm were graded from 0 to III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship of the SAH grade in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure (IHF) to the presence of vasospasm at the A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery and the relationship of the SAH grade in the sylvian stems to the presence of vasospasm at the M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation of preoperative and postoperative SAH grades with the angiographic vasospasm grades, with the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, and with the low-density area on CT could be found in the A2 and M1 territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decrease of cisternal blood measured by CT after the operation did not relate directly to the reduction of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the SAH was Grade II or III in the basal frontal IHF, the angiographic vasospasm grades at the A2 were significantly lower in patients with surgery via the interhemispheric approach than in those with surgery via the pterional approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in two of the eight cases operated on by the interhemispheric approach compared with 11 of the 22 cases approached via the pterional route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with a pterional approach, there was no significant difference in severity of vasospasm in the M1 territory between the side of approach and the opposite side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No consistent relationship could be found between the time interval from SAH to operation and the severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While clot removal may ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, its effect per se does not seem to be significant </plain></SENT>
