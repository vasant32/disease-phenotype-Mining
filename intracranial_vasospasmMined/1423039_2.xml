<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews our recent studies on the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) vasospasm was maximal at 7 days, resolving by 14 days, and absent at 28 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was not detected during vasospasm, although there was intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> 28 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On scanning electron microscopy, smooth muscle cells from vasospastic arteries had corrugated cell membranes and appeared similar to cells contracted pharmacologically, suggesting that vasospastic smooth muscle is contracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of arteries obtained 7 days after SAH showed no significant increases in arterial wall area of vasospastic arteries compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest vasospasm in monkeys is not due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm may be mainly vascular smooth muscle contraction, which damages the arterial wall, leading to secondary structural changes in the arterial wall which occur after angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
