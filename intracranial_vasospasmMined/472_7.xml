<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This finding supports a recent hypothesis of others that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to blood or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, however, the spasm induced by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was delayed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, less in incidence, and usually less intense </plain></SENT>
