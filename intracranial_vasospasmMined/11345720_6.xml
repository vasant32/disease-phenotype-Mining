<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The O2 consumption of the porcine carotid artery was monitored, using an oxygen electrode, after exposure to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients who had a SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vessels were exposed to CSF from SAH patients at a 1 in 30 dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Force measurements were carried out using freeze-dried CSF, reconstituted in the organ bath equivalent to undiluted CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations were then compared to the patients' condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided the patient CSF samples into those that stimulated oxygen consumption above 0.4 microM/min/g dry wt, and those that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that there was a correlation between the stimulation of oxygen consumption and the Fisher grade as well as the World Federation of Neurosurgeons Grading System (WFNS) for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the CSF tested, 24 stimulated oxygen consumption above our cut off, and 8 did not (0.84 +/- 0.34, n = 24 compared with the rate of 0.27 +/- 0.1 mumol/min/g dry wt, respectively; SD n = 8) at 180 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then examined the Fisher Grades of these two groups, the results were 3.21 +/- 0.88 vs 2.25 +/- 0.83 respectively (SD p &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When examining the WFNS System we found a similar difference between the groups that stimulated respiration and those who did not (WFNS Grades of 2.64 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.53; p &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed stimulation of oxygen consumption also correlated with tension generation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CSF from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients stimulates the oxygen consumption of the porcine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This stimulation correlated to the WFNS and Fisher Grades of the patients and can be performed using 1:30 dilution of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the metabolic changes that occur in the vessels during vasospasm are important parameters for assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
