<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The involvement of thrombin in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was investigated by comparing thrombin expression and extrinsic pathway activation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of patients with SAH with the neurological grades, outcome, and presence of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood and CSF samples were obtained from 38 patients with SAH on Days 3 through 5, 7 through 9, and 12 through 14 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were also obtained from control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-antithrombin III complex, prothrombin fragment F1 +2, tissue factor, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No markers in the blood or CSF were correlated with neurological grades and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-antithrombin III complex and prothrombin fragment F1 +2 levels were significantly higher in the CSF of patients with SAH than in the blood or the CSF of control patients and were significantly higher in patients with vasospasm than in patients without vasospasm on Days 7 through 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor levels were significantly higher in the CSF of patients with SAH than in the blood, but the levels were close to those in the CSF of control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels in the CSF of patients with SAH and control patients were under the detection limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thrombin in the blood may not reflect the pathophysiology of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imbalance between tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor in the CSF may tend to thrombin generation under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological conditions and also after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombin in the CSF may be involved in the pathophysiology of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
