<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a common and serious complication of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many studies have revealed a role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether topically administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> could attenuate vasospasm in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired samples were designed to compare postoperative mean middle cerebral artery velocity between treated patients and controls matched for age (+/-10 years), sex, location and size (small, medium or large) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, as well as baseline mean middle cerebral artery velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We enrolled ten consecutive aneurysmal SAH patients who had Hunt-Hess (HH) grade 3 and Fish grade 3 lesions and were admitted within 24 hours following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 10mg topically at the end of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each treated patient was matched with a control patient who did not receive topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> controls also had HH grade 3 and Fish grade 3 SAH and were admitted within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of mean middle cerebral artery velocity were performed postoperatively every day for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed with the paired t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient (10%) in the treated group had vasospasm, without neurological deficit, compared with four patients (40%) in the control group, one of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Paired t-test showed that the mean middle cerebral artery velocity in controls was significantly higher than that in treated patients on days 4-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> is a promising strategy for prevention and attenuation of vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
