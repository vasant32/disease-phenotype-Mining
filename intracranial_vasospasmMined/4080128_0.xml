<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two cases of nontraumatic SAH of unknown cause of a total of 254 cases of SAH treated during a 5-year period (1980-1984) were available for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study (4 to 61 months after treatment; median, 43 months) revealed a 4.5% mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients chosen from among the 22 SAH cases underwent prophylactic operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decision to operate was based on repeated angiography showing regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> corresponding to a limited hyperdense area on the computed tomographic scan at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsurgery revealed a minute protrusion (less than 2 mm in diameter) or thinning of the arterial wall with old <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> of the surrounding brain in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 cases, and treatment required only coating of the abnormal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients are now fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequently, abnormal changes of such cerebral arteries as the anterior communicating artery, the internal carotid artery (C-1 and C-2), and the middle cerebral artery (M-1) may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors emphasize the necessity of surgical treatment for specific cases of SAH with an unknown cause </plain></SENT>
