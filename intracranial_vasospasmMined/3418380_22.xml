<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated the ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotrienes C4</z:chebi> and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> (i-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> levels in the CSF after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
