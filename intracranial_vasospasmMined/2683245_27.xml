<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the in vivo vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin, a recently characterized vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> from vascular endothelium, in the basilar arteries of five cats and five dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery caliber was angiographically measured under anesthesia before (control) and after either vertebral artery infusion or cisternal injection of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cats, 5-500 pmol endothelin induced a dose-dependent basilar artery contraction in vivo when injected intracisternally; within 3 minutes after injection of 500 pmol endothelin, basilar artery caliber was decreased by 73 +/- 4% compared with control diameter before injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction was extremely long-lasting; no significant recovery of basilar artery caliber was observed for up to 2 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, infusion of up to 3,000 pmol endothelin into the vertebral artery had no appreciable effect on basilar artery caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in dogs; vasoconstriction was maintained for as long as 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that endothelin acts in cerebral vessels from the adventitial side, not from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side, possibly due to the presence of the blood-arterial wall barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-lasting nature of endothelin-induced constriction of the cerebral arteries in vivo suggests that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
