<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With microsurgical techniques, 33 monkeys had a frontotemporal craniectomy and unilateral opening of the subarachnoid cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid was drained and a fresh <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, obtained from an average of 7 ml of autologous blood, was carefully placed against the major arteries of the anterior circulation on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 30 monkeys studied for 7 to 14 days after the SAH were allocated randomly to two treatment groups of 15: one group received placebo and the other nimodipine, 1 mg/kg every 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indices monitored before and after SAH included neurological status, cerebral blood flow, computerized tomography, and angiographic vessel caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, delayed ischemic neurological deficit developed in one monkey 4 days after clot placement and was present at sacrifice on Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No such deficit occurred in the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of nimodipine on vessel caliber at this dosage was equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant vasospasm (31% to 100% reduction in vessel caliber) developed in 87% (26 of 30) of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, vasospasm was slightly more common in the placebo group: in this group, on Days 7 and 14, the incidence of vasospasm was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than in the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the average percentage reduction in vessel caliber of the maximally constricted vessel in each monkey was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
