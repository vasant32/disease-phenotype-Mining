<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is a potent mediator of vasodilation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> is a known contributor to NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> can increase vasoconstrictive compounds that may also contribute to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> is a glucocorticosteroid commonly administered after SAH, which may alter the production of leukocytes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this project was to study the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi>, and angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental SAH was induced in 18 New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> was administered to one group (N.=9) at 2 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A placebo group (N.=9) was given a saline infusion with otherwise identical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi>, leukocytes, protein, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, as well as plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> were measured at baseline and 3 days post-SAH in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery angiography was performed at baseline and repeated 3 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The change in CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> from day 0 to day 3 was significantly lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> group compared to controls (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The change in CSF white blood cells was also significantly lower (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> levels or angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> significantly decreases CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> and CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is possible this could lead to a relative vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These processes could cancel-out opposing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, partially contributing to the recognized, multifactorial, inconsistent effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
