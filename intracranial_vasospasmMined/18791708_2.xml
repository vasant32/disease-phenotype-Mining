<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Papaverine is known to have side effects, and we report a possible new one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a SAH patient by intra-arterial administration of papaverine into the left posterior cerebral artery, severe mesencephalic extravasation of blood and contrast media was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After reviewing the literature, the authors conclude that interruption of the blood-brain barrier by papaverine most likely combined with a secondary hyperperfusion phenomena, and perhaps a direct toxic effect on brain tissue was the mechanism of this major complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In treating vasospasm in areas with a high density of perforating arteries, especially in the posterior circulation, papaverine should be used cautiously because a safe regimen has yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this situation, alternative agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> could be considered, but evidence-based data are still missing </plain></SENT>
