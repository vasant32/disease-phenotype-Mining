<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the mean haematocrit (Hct) was reduced from 40 +/- 1% (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) to 32 +/- 0% (p less than 0.001), reductions in vascular resistance were significant across the 90% (p less than 0.001) and 95% (p less than 0.0003) relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isovolemic haemodilution reduced fresh blood viscosity significantly by 27 +/- 3% (p less than 0.001) and 42 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) at the low shear rates of 10 sec-1 and 1 sec-1 which are typical of low-flow states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a 20% reduction in Hct 30 to 35% increase (p less 0.001) in carotid blood flow occurred at non-critical degrees of stenosis while a mean 83% increase (p less than 0.001) occurred at the highly critical 95% relative stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxygen transport after a 22% decrease in blood <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was significantly increased by 28% (p less than 0.01) at the 95% relative stenosis level </plain></SENT>
