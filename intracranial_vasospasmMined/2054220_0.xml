<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in experiment study was thought as resulting from brain stem dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, some reports have shown no relationship between vasospasm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of cerebral metabolism <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> after SAH remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of blood in the cortical subarachnoid space on the cerebral metabolism has not been known well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate this effect, a new cortical SAH model was developed using rat and local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCGU) after production of SAH was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cortical SAH model: a small burr hole was made on the left parietal bone and the arachnoid membrane was pierced with a tapered glass-needle 60 mu tip in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fresh autologous non-heparinized arterial blood 0.04 ml was injected into subarachnoid space within 60 seconds through that needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood extended over the left cerebral cortical surface with thin subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on the parietal cortex, but did not extend on the right hemisphere and the basal cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in ICP during production of SAH was minimal, mean value of 7.2 mmHg and ICP slowly returned to the basal level within 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into 3 groups; rats 2 hours (SAH-2h, n = 7) and 48 hours (SAH-48h, n = 7) after production of SAH and rats 2hours after 0.04 ml saline injection for control (Control, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LCGU was studied according to the methods developed by Sokoloff.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
