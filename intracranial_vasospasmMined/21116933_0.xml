<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model comprises examiner-dependent variables and does not closely represent the human pathophysiological sequelae of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of achieved delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCVS) in this model is often mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize and evaluate the feasibility of a clinically more relevant experimental SAH in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH was performed by arterial blood shunting from the subclavian artery into the great cerebral cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of five experiments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gas analysis, and neurological status were monitored throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAH induced vasoconstriction of the basilar artery was 52.1Â±3.4% on day 3 compared to baseline (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem gross examination of the brain showed massive blood clot accumulation around the brainstem and ventral surface of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The novel technique offers an examiner independent SAH induction and triggers high degrees of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The severity of vasospasm attained offers a unique opportunity to evaluate future therapeutic treatment options </plain></SENT>
