<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies with intracranial arteries of animals have some limitations, however, because in most cases endovascular devices are too large and inflexible to catheterize these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to document the natural course of a vasospasm model using a rabbit common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The common carotid arteries of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood was placed around the isolated artery and kept in place with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> cuff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time course of vasoconstriction after blood clot placement was examined with angiography and with histopathologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic vasoconstriction was prominent on day 2, less obvious on day 9, and absent on day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At histopathologic evaluation, folding of the endothelial surface, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina, and thickening of the arterial wall were observed in the group with blood clot placements around the artery on day 2 and were nearly absent on day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This model may be used for the study of endovascular treatments of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
