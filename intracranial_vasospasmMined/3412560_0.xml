<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From the previous reports that the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is most likely multifactorial process and that early removal of the clot may decrease the incidence or severity of the ischemic deficits and also that antifibrinolytic therapy increases the incidence and the severity of the symptomatic vasospasm, we attempted at prevention of the symptomatic vasospasm in aneurysmal patients with our own protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were operated upon within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients in group (A) were treated with a regimen of postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">Ticlopidine</z:chebi> and Nicardipine without antifibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients in group (B) were not treated with the above regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred only in four patients (5%) in group (A), but in 18 patients (33%) in group (B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total series, 82% in group (A) and 63% in group (B) had an excellent to good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine % in group (A) and 20% in group (B) had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that our protocol with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">Ticlopidine</z:chebi> and Nicardipine can reduce the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm following the aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
