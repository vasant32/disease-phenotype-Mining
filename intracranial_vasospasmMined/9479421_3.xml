<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the levels of D dimer in the CSF and blood of patients with SAH to analyse the correlation between fibrinolytic activity and VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF and blood samples were obtained three times, and VS was identified by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of D dimer in the CSF were significantly higher than in the blood, but changes with time were inverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with VS showed significantly lower levels of D dimer in both CSF and blood in the initial stage compared to those without VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that monitoring of fibrinolytic activity in the CSF to identify patients eligible for additional fibrinolytic treatment could reduce the risk of VS and iatrogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
