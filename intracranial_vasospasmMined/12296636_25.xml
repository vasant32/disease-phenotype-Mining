<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Proinflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression has been demonstrated to be elevated in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that elevations in soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) may be predictive of poor outcome in patients with good grade (Hunt and Hess Grades 1-2) aneurysmal SAH at delayed time points that correspond with the risk period for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, ICAM-1 is upregulated in experimental models of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression to human vasospasm remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that the delayed elevation of soluble ICAM-1 in patients with aneurysmal SAH is associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with aneurysmal SAH were prospectively enrolled in a study and stratified according to the presence or absence of vasospasm, as evidenced by daily monitoring of transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities (presence, &gt; 200 cm/second; absence, &lt; 120 cm/second) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of soluble ICAM-1 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay every other day for 12 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An analysis of covariance model was used to evaluate trends in soluble ICAM-1 levels from 2 days prior to 6 days after the occurrence of documented vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients, matched for admission admission Hunt and Hess grade, were compared: nine patients with TCD velocities greater than 200 cm/second and nine patients with TCD velocities less than 120 cm/second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From among the patients with TCD velocities greater than 200 cm/second six patients with angiographically documented vasospasm were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with TCD velocities less than 120 cm/second and matched admission Hunt and Hess grades but without angiographically documented vasospasm were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with TCD-demonstrated vasospasm showed a significant mean rate of rise (p &lt; 0.01) in soluble ICAM-1 levels during the perivasospasm period, but admission Hunt and Hess grade-matched control patients did not (p = not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between these groups' rates of soluble ICAM increase (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with both TCD- and angiographically demonstrated vasospasm likewise showed a highly significant mean rate of increase in soluble ICAM-1 levels during the perivasospasm period (p &lt; 0.01), whereas admission Hunt and Hess grade-matched controls did not (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The difference beween these groups' rates of increase was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a role for ICAM-1 in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or its ischemic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As this relationship is further elucidated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules such as ICAM-1 may provide novel therapeutic targets in the prevention of vasospasm or its ischemic consequences </plain></SENT>
