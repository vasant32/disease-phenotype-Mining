<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The control of contraction and relaxation is dependent upon intracellular and extracellular signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal contractions can cause and or contribute to pathology such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we address the vascular pathogenesis associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is a multifactorial disease with many causes and a profound impact on the cardiovascular system, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a pathological vasoconstriction often causing infarction that is thought to be 'caused' by a factor or factors in the CSF following the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which the vessels are constricted is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the causes for these two pathological vasoconstrictions remain to be determined, we conclude that the common denominator is that these contractile changes result in pathology with devastating consequences to human health </plain></SENT>
