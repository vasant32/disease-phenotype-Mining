<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Multislice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) can provide clearer vascular images, even of the peripheral arteries, than conventional CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multislice CTA was compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) to analyze whether multislice CTA can replace DSA in the detection of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within 72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, multislice CTA and DSA were performed in 20 patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multislice CTA and DSA were repeated on Day 7 to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest were established in the proximal and distal segments of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries on both multislice CTA and DSA images, and the agreement between the severity of vasospasm on multislice CTA and DSA images was statistically compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multislice Aquilon computed tomography system (Toshiba, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) used the following parameters: 1 mm collimation and 3.5 mm per rotation table increment (pitch, 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of vasospasm as revealed by multislice CTA correlated significantly with the degree of vasospasm revealed by DSA (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the severity of vasospasm on multislice images obtained via CTA and DSA in the overall, proximal, and distal segments of the cerebral arteries was 91.6, 90.8, and 92.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multislice CTA can detect angiographic vasospasm after SAH with accuracy equal to that of DSA </plain></SENT>
