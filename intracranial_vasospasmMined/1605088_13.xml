<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 145 patients, who had been operated on in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, were classified into two age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those aged 59 years or younger were in group 1 (76 cases, 52%), and those aged 60 years or older were in group 2 (69 cases, 48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severities of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasm were graded from 0 to IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Close correlations were found in both groups for the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of both symptomatic vasospasm and low-density areas on computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm was observed in 95% of group 1 and in 91% of group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of permanent symptomatic vasospasm were 14% in group 1 and 19% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-density areas on computed tomography occurred in 16% of group 1 and in 17% of group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Generally, the higher the clinical grades and/or the higher the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> grades, the more severe were the vasospasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These tendencies were more apparent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates were 8% in group 1 and 17% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, when both the clinical grades and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> grades were analyzed, there were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in either the severity of vasospasm or in the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It must be concluded that neither the angiographic vasospasm grades nor the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm are significantly effected by age </plain></SENT>
