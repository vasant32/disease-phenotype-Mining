<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) is a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and a primary signaling molecule in neurovascular communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors examined cerebrovascular responses to CGRP and its related second messenger systems during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tension measurements were performed in vitro on ring strips of basilar arteries obtained from rabbits subjected to artificial SAH and from control (non-SAH) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vessels from SAH animals, which were preconstricted with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, the vasorelaxant response to CGRP was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because it has been suggested that vasodilation elicited by CGRP is mediated by cyclic 3',5'-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) and/or cyclic 3',5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP), the vascular effects of directly activating these second messenger systems were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relaxant effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>, which activates adenylate cyclase directly, was slightly enhanced after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the relaxant effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (GTN), which activates soluble guanylate cyclase directly, was unchanged after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The attenuation of CGRP-induced vasorelaxation could be the result of a modification in its ability to stimulate the production of second messengers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiments testing the capacity of CGRP to elevate cAMP levels showed no significant differences between vessels from non-SAH and SAH animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the resting levels of cAMP and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-induced elevations of cAMP did not differ between non-SAH and SAH animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cGMP levels were lower in resting and CGRP-treated vessels from SAH animals than in those from non-SAH animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the levels of cGMP were observed between non-SAH and SAH vessels treated with GTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that CGRP-induced vasodilation is attenuated during vasospasm in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings also demonstrate that vasodilatory responses mediated by cAMP and cGMP are intact, although the levels of cGMP in SAH vessels are reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations suggest that an attenuation in the capacity of vessels to dilate in response to CGRP occurs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and this change in CGRP vasoactivity is a result of modifications prior to, or independent of, the elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> second messengers </plain></SENT>
