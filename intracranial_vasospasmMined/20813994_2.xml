<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment modality (clipping or coiling) on the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> have not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that there may be a difference in angiographic and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> infarction, and clinical outcome between patients undergoing clipping compared to coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective, exploratory analysis of 413 patients randomized into the CONSCIOUS-1 trial was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent baseline and follow-up catheter angiography and computed tomography, as well as clinical assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiology end points were adjudicated by central blinded review, and angiographic vasospasm was quantified by measurements of arterial diameters on catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment (clipping [n=199] or coiling [n=214]) on angiographic vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurological deficit, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and clinical outcome was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Propensity matching was used to adjust for differences in baseline risk factors between clipped and coiled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and the propensity-matched subset, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling was associated with a significantly reduced risk of angiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficit compared to clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> and clinical outcome were not associated with clipping or coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling was associated with less angiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficit than surgical clipping, whereas no effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or clinical outcome was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether this is attributable to differences in baseline risk factors between clipped and coiled patients or a true difference cannot be proven here </plain></SENT>
