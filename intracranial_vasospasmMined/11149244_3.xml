<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dipyrone (Metamizol) has been in clinical use for its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35481">non-narcotic analgesic</z:chebi> effect since 1922 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to its <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> effect, dipyrone has been shown to possess spasmolitic activity in various smooth muscle organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our recent study, it was shown that dipyrone also has a relaxing effect in vascular smooth muscle preparations and that the smooth muscle relaxing effect on the rabbit thoracic aorta was produced by one of dipyrone's spontaneous degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the possible effects of dipyrone on the rabbit basilar artery in a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dipyrone was shown to have a clear spasmolitic effect in the rabbit basilar artery vasospasm produced by an intracisternal injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was apparent with either local or intravenous administration of dipyrone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that dipyrone is potentially useful in the treatment of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in combination with other agents or alone </plain></SENT>
