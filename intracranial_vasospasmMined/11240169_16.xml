<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to assess brain tissue monitoring for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to vasospasm in aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After obtaining informed consent, a burr hole was made in 10 patients and a Neurotrend 7 probe was inserted ipsilateral to the region of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight patients the probe was inserted during surgery for clipping the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in two patients the probe was inserted in the neurosurgery ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue gases and pH were collected over 6-hour periods for 7 to 10 days until the termination of monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm was confirmed by angiography and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography (Xe/CT) cerebral blood flow studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients did not develop vasospasm during monitoring and were considered as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, brain tissue oxygen pressure (PO(2)) remained above 20 mmHg, carbon dioxide pressure (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>(2)) stabilized at 40 mmHg and pH remained between 7.1 and 7.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients who developed vasospasm during monitoring, PO(2) was not different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>(2) increased to 60 mmHg and pH decreased to 6.7 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with SAH who developed vasospasm had significantly lower brain tissue pH and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>(2) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant change in PO(2) levels associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue monitoring can provide an indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
