<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether rapid spontaneous diminution of subarachnoid blood alleviates vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effect of diminution of SAH on vasospasm in 36 patients with SAH grades III-IV who were operated on by the same surgeon by day 6 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diminution of subarachnoid blood became more apparent with shorter interval between <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and initial computed tomography (CT) scan, with increasing patient age, and with higher SAH grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of angiographic vasospasm grades III-IV, permanent symptomatic vasospasm, and low-density area on CT scans decreased with the increase in the degree of diminution of subarachnoid blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on CT scans were found in 5 of 9 patients with no diminution, whereas they occurred only in 5 of 27 patients with diminution (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that spontaneous diminution of subarachnoid blood in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after SAH seems to reduce the severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
