<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, we performed serial neurological evaluations, transcranial Doppler examinations, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We classified 8 patients as having vasospasm (delayed neurological deterioration, appropriate reduction of CBF) and 13 patients as having no spasm on the basis of this information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral artery were significantly elevated for the group with vasospasm on posthemorrhage Days 4 through 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevation of transcranial Doppler velocities preceded clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal transcranial Doppler flow velocities achieved were compared on the basis of the extent of clot on early computed tomographic (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean anterior cerebral artery flow velocities were significantly different between CT Grades II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial transcranial Doppler flow velocities were compared on the basis of the patient's Hunt and Hess grade upon admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The flow velocities for Grade V patients were significantly lower than those for Grade IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler flow velocities were compared with arteriographically observed anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery radii in 12 instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation was poor, but the data should be interpreted cautiously in view of the small number of arteriograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transcranial Doppler examination has considerable potential in the early diagnosis of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (clinical vasospasm) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
