<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the effect of extracellular <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg2+) on the vascular reactivity of feline isolated middle cerebral arteries, the effects of slight alterations in the Mg2+ concentration on the contractile and endothelium-dependent dilatory responses were investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contractions, induced by 10(-8)-10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, were significantly potentiated at low Mg2+ (0.8 mM v. the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1.2 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High (1.6 and 2.0 mM) Mg2+ exhibited an inhibitory effect on the contractile responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant changes, however, in the EC50 values for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by 10(-8)-10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> were inhibited by high (1.6 and 2.0 mM) Mg2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lowering of the Mg2+ concentration to 0.8 mM or total withdrawal of this ion from the medium failed to alter the dilatory potency of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in the dilatory responses also shifted the EC50 values for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results show that the contractile responses of the cerebral arteries are extremely susceptible to the changes of Mg2+ concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In response to contractile and endothelium-dependent dilatory <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, Mg2+ probably affects both the calcium influx into the endothelial and smooth muscle cells as well as the binding of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> to its endothelial receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since Mg2+ deficiency might facilitate the contractile but not the endothelium-dependent relaxant responses, the present study supports a role for Mg2+ deficiency in the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
