<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunostain for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> showed a strong positivity in intima and adventitia and a scattered reaction in media of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was little changed in intima and media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cells which were characterized histochemically as neutrophils and macrophages, were shown to infiltrate from the adventitia of basilar artery to the periphery of blood clot after SAH and were markedly immunoreactive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also the neutrophils increased in number with the lapse of time after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, it would be reasonable to conclude that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> responsible for the development of vasospasm would most likely be produced from the infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, neurons in hypothalamus, median eminence, and pons, as well as ependymal and arachnoid cells were immunoreactive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> both in the control and after SAH, whereas astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were not immunoreactive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> in either case </plain></SENT>
