<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To define the relationship between the immunologic reaction and the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VS) following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), we examined the effect of a cell mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi>, FK-506, isolated from Streptomyces tsukubaensis, by using the canine SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a significant vasoconstriction in the basilar artery in the control group after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This constriction, however was not successfully prevented by FK-506 or combination of FK-506 and steroid, since there was no significant difference in the vessel caliber size among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathologic approach, accompanied by immunohistochemistry, could not discriminate the differences in the nature of the lesion between the untreated group and FK-506 treated groups, except for slight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltrations</z:e> present around the basilar artery of untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, inflammatory reactions consisting of neutrophils, that were not suppressed by FK-506 treatment, were clearly seen around the spastic vessels in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several constrictive changes or degenerative alterations were also observed in the spastic vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the deposition of IgG, IgM and C3 was present in the intima and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side of the smooth muscle layer, and capillary vessels of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is considered that this deposition was caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> in VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the above findings that the cell mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi>, FK-506 failed to prevent vasoconstriction or pathologic lesions but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltrations</z:e>, it is considered that the cell mediated immunopathogenesis may play little role in producing VS following SAH </plain></SENT>
