<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ras, an upstream regulator of MAPK, may be activated following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Ras in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first investigated the time course of Ras and ERK1/2 activation in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, for the time point at which Ras was maximally activated, we assessed the effect of FTI-277 (a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna on both day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTI-277 was injected into the cisterna magna every 24 hours, beginning 30 minutes after blood injection to the last day of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of Ras-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> and phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and expression peaked on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FTI-277 administration resulted in lower Ras-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels and markedly attenuated vasospasm in the basilar arteries relative to animals that did not receive FTI-277 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Ras protein is activated in the arterial wall after SAH and contributes to vasospasm development </plain></SENT>
