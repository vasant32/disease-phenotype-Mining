<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This constriction could be significantly increased if <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> was added to B1, but not when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response to B2 was not enhanced by the simultaneous addition of either <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
