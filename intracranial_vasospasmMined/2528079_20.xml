<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used intracerebral transluminal angioplasty to treat two episodes of symptomatic vasospasm in a patient recovering from an aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed after medical therapies, intravascular volume expansion, and induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> failed to alleviate the patient's neurological condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first angioplasty, confined to the right middle cerebral and distal internal carotid arteries, took place more than 30 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the subsequent discovery of a small parietal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, it brought about a marked improvement in left motor function and may have also limited the spread of necrotic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second angioplasty was necessitated when stenotic segments of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries caused a 24-hour decline in the patient's mental status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although delayed in relation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, it successfully reversed the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm is generally limited to cases where it can be performed shortly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms; delaying the procedure increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from reperfused areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our experience with this patient demonstrates that delayed angioplasty can improve vascular flow to ischemic territory, even after infarction, without complications and with resultant improvement in neurological function </plain></SENT>
