<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether recombinant OPN (r-OPN) could prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: r-OPN was administered intraventricularly to rats undergoing SAH by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and its protective effects were evaluated by measuring the diameter of cerebral arteries and neurobehavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An integrin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GRGDSP or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP)-1 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) was also administered to r-OPN-treated SAH rats, and those effects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-SAH administration of r-OPN prevented vasospasm and neurological impairments at 24-72 hours post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>r-OPN enhanced an endogenous MAPK inhibitor, MKP-1, and suppressed the phosphorylation of MAPKs, caldesmon, and heat shock protein 27 in the spastic cerebral arteries at 24 hours post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence revealed that MKP-1 was induced in the arterial smooth muscle layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GRGDSP prevented r-OPN-induced MKP-1 upregulation, and MKP-1 siRNA abolished both MAPK inactivation and anti-vasospastic effects by r-OPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-SAH r-OPN treatment also prevented vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: r-OPN induced MKP-1 in the spastic cerebral arteries via binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29952,32684">L-arginyl</z:chebi>-glycyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29993">L-aspartate</z:chebi>-dependent integrin receptors and prevented vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic induction of MKP-1 may be a novel approach for the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
