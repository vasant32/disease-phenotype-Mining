<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal continuous administration of these substances for CVS prevention has not been extensively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the efficacy of continuous intrathecal infusions of the NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">glyceroltrinitrate</z:chebi> and nimodipine in preventing delayed CVS associated with SAH in an animal model in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to six groups: no SAH/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, no SAH/NO, no SAH/nimodipine, SAH/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, SAH/NO, or SAH/nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">Glyceroltrinitrate</z:chebi> (GTN) at 0.5 microg/microl (0.5 microl/h) or nimodipine at 0.2 microg/microl (10 microl/h) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> was continuously infused into the cisterna magna via an Alzet osmotic pump from day 0 to day 5 after injection of 1.0 ml autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of spasm in the basilar artery was determined by comparison of pre- and posttreatment angiography and was calculated as proportional change in intraluminal diameter based on automatic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 55 experiments and 110 angiograms were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAH was associated with vasoconstriction of the basilar artery (SAH/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> group 19.85+/-2.94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous intrathecal injection of GTN and nimodipine prevented SAH-induced CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significant prevention of CVS in animals treated with GTN (SAH/NO group 5.93+/-5.2%, n=11) and nimodipine (SAH/nimodipine group: 0.55+/-2.66%, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the treatment groups and controls in prevention of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that prophylactic continuous intrathecal administration of either GTN or nimodipine equally prevents SAH-associated CVS in an animal model </plain></SENT>
