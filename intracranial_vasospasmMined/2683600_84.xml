<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One radiologist and one neurovascular surgeon assessed angiographic spasm visually on a four-level scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiologist's ratings were the term of reference for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When there was angiographic spasm of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood velocity was higher and the blood velocity in the distal extracranical internal carotid artery (ICA) was lower than when <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm was scored as absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis by Kappa statistics, a measure for the agreement between two independent judges with correction for random coincidence, revealed moderate agreement between angiographic spasm and the absolute <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood velocity (Kappa = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was substantial agreement (Kappa = 0.64) between angiographic spasm and the index calculated from dividing the blood velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (VMCA) by the blood velocity in the ipsilateral ICA (VICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that this VMCA/VICA index gives more appropriate information on <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Congenitally asymmetric circles of Willis with one wide dominant ACA showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In asymmetry induced by vasospasm, the diameter of the major ACA was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or even reduced, and the blood velocity was significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, the agreement between blood velocity recordings and angiographic findings was substantial (Kappa = 0.64) when considering together the findings from both sides of the anterior circle of Willis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
