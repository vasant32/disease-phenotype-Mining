<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adrenergic denervation of cat basilar artery was accomplished by resection of the superior cervical ganglia or by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo dose-response characteristics were determined for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and for denervated arteries, and no significant differences were found between topical applications of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, fresh blood, or incubated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of cat blood incubated in vitro revealed that the levels of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> diminished over time, whereas levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and methemoglobin increased up to Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that adrenergic denervation is not the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and that, whatever the mechanism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> is far more likely to play a role than are the other agents </plain></SENT>
