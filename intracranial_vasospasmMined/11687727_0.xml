<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Posthemorrhagic vasospasm can be counteracted by the administration of phosphoramidon, which blocks the endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) responsible for the conversion of big endothelin into a fully active ET1 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm after SAH on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and the effect on this process of endothelin-1, the main causative factor in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after cannulation of the cisterna magna, blood was administered to induce SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ECE inhibitor phosphoramidon was administered in a dose of 40 nmol in 50 microl of cerebrospinal fluid three times: 20 min before SAH, 60 min after SAH, and 24 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed 48 hours later for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vascular surface density was measured in cerebral hemisphere sections (at the level of the dorsal part of the hippocampus) and brainstem sections (1/2 of the pons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>Increased angiogenesis</z:mp> was observed in the cerebral hemispheres after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of phosphoramidon inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in cerebral hemispheres after SAH </plain></SENT>
