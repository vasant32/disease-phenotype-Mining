<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven or 10 days later the cats were anesthetized and perfused with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi>, and the basilar arteries were prepared for light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful clot deposition was confirmed by the presence of numerous erythrocytes or latex beads within the adventitia of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous studies, instillation of whole blood produced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing associated with profound ultrastructural changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant alterations, however, occurred in arteries bathed in erythrocyte-free blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest first, that erythrocytes are essential for the development of the vasculopathy associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and second, that the role, if any, of other blood elements is not autonomous </plain></SENT>
