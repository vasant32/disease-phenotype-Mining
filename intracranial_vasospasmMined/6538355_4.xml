<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed vasospasm was defined as a reduction to less than 75% of the caliber of control basilar artery 5 days after the intracisternal blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A selective inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>(E)-3-[4-(3-pyridylmethyl) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>]-2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37080">propenoate</z:chebi>, was infused intravenously for 1 or 2 hrs at 50 micrograms/kg/min in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals exhibiting vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was not reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly increased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and vasospastic animals, but a mean difference of regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased only in vasospastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were not seriously changed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and spastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, (E)-3-[4-(1-imidazolylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>]-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18308">propenoic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> monohydrate, showed a similar effect on the caliber of the basilar artery, regional cerebral blood flow, blood pressure, and pulse rate, in vasospastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was taken from the internal jugular vein, and the mean platelet aggregation induced by 10 micrograms/ml of collagen was inhibited by the infusion of either selective inhibitor at 50 micrograms/kg/min for 2 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, mean platelet aggregation rates in vasospastic animals before and after treatment with either selective inhibitor were not significantly different to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
