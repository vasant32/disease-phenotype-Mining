<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was a sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 2 animals received a continuous cisternal injection of endothelin-1 (1.7 x 10(-9) mol/7 days) by a miniosmotic pump implanted in the neck musculature for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 3 received double injections of cisternal blood administered 48 hours apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed severe constriction of the basilar artery, 34.6% and 43% in Groups 2 and 3, respectively, on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological study showed marked constriction of the basilar artery in both Group 2 and Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degenerative changes in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were observed in both Group 2 and Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated endothelin-1 in the endothelial cells in Group 2, but not in Group 1 or in Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that endothelin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
