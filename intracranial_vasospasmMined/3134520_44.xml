<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the presence of vasospasm was confirmed by cerebral angiography on Days 0 and 7, pharmacological studies on the basilar artery were conducted in vitro on Day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, endothelium-dependent relaxation was abolished in response to arginine vasopressin and was significantly reduced in response to thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-independent relaxation in the SAH group was preserved in response to papaverine and was minimally reduced in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent contraction in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi>, mechanical stretching, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> persisted in the SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal contraction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, which is endothelium-independent, was diminished in the SAH group, but not changes in sensitivity were noted in the concentration-response relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between the degree of vasospasm determined angiographically and the loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the persistence of endothelium-dependent contraction suggest that the deterioration in the endothelium-dependent responses may be an important component in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
