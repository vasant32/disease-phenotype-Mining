<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains a major therapeutic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systemic drug administration is the current treatment of choice, but patients often do not respond beneficially to this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal (IT) drug administration has several anatomic and pharmacodynamic advantages over conventional systemic treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the most recent literature describing IT administration of several drugs to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-induced SAH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, including 16 clinical trials using IT fibrinolytic agents and 10 trials using several IT <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of these trials but made no attempt to perform a meta-analysis using these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IT drug administration of fibrinolytic agents and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> caused lysis of the subarachnoid clot burden and diminished <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The studies reviewed reported a wide range of drug doses, intervals between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and initiation of treatment, success of clot dissolution, and degree of vasodilation of vessels in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of vasospasm by IT drug administration is safe and largely effective after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has been secured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that IT treatment effectively delivers a higher drug concentration to vessels in vasospasm with minimal systemic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drugs administered by this route are reported to lyse subarachnoid clots, attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With greater understanding of drug pharmacodynamics, the IT route of drug administration may provide a rational, alternative approach to treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
