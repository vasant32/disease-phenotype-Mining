<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 194 patients underwent complete cerebral angiography using microcatheter under DSA imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>80 cases with 90 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were emboliced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 69 cases with 71 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were emboliced by GDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>37 of 40 giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were emboliced by detachable balloon, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by GDC, 1 by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 194 patients with 201 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were cured successfully; 191 cases recovered clinically, 3 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>187 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> achieved 100% embolization, 8 with 95% embolization, 4 with 90% embolization, and 1 with 80% embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> reputured during the embolization, 4 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, one patient died by hard-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> which was affected by microcoil escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two recurrent cases were cured by second GDC embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The method of endovascular embolization to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is safe, reliable and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those cases with giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> will have high recurrence in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who suffer from SAH repeatedly may have great possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture during embolization </plain></SENT>
