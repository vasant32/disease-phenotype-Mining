<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (35.6%) of the 73 patients developed ischemic neurological symptoms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, which were reversible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except four patients (5.5%) who demonstrated low-density areas associated with vasospasm on computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries began to increase soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH, reaching the maximum between days 8 and 10, subsequently decreasing gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the highest value and the time course of flow velocities between symptomatic vasospasm and asymptomatic vasospasm patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic vasospasm demonstrated two typical time courses of flow velocities: rapid increases in flow velocities that preceded the clinical manifestations of vasospasm (16 patients, 61.5%), and no rapid increases in flow velocities despite the presence of ischemic symptoms (10 patients, 38.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the latter, angiograms demonstrated vasospasm in segments distal to those evaluated by TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> cannot be assessed only by the absolute flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured two to 10 (mean 4.7) times within 3 weeks of SAH using the 133Xe intravenous injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CBF value remained stable even during the period of major risk of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the CBF was significantly lower in patients with symptomatic vasospasm on days 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15, when compared with patients without symptomatic vasospasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
