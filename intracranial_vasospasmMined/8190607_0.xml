<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> angiographically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced by producing a blood clot in the subarachnoid space around the top of internal carotid siphon in Japanese monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After angiographic recognition of vasospasm, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was carried out with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> microballoon at 1 atmosphere, 3 times for 10 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> disclosed significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, without any significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of distal spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was then infused intra-arterially, which resulted in significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of distal spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon histological examination, deformation and some denudation of endothelial cells were noted in the intimal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the site of denudation, attachment of platelets was observed despite generalized heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internal elastic lamina and the media were also stretched and myocytes were deformed and arranged irregularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were not uniform <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the vascular walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the prolonged effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> may be caused by mechanical damage of endothelial cells and myocytes, and the nonuniformity of histological changes in vascular wall may be a leading cause of its rupture during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
