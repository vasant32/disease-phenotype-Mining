<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spasm, phosphodiesterase inhibition by Aminophylline consistently reversed the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This agent alone was ineffective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> spasm and required the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> to produce reversal of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be associated with a decrease of intracellular c-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> in vascular smooth muscle which can be reversed by manipulation of the enzyme pathway involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is further proposed that c-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> is a basic common pathway through which adrenergic vascular reactivities are mediated </plain></SENT>
