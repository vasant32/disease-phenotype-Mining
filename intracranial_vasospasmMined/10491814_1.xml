<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple methods have been used to clarify the mechanism of spasmogen-induced vasospasm, however, each method has its own limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured cells lose their phenotype and inter-cellular interactions, and animal models are expensive and can be used only in some established centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated cerebral arteries have been used extensively to study the contractility by transient exposure to spasmogens that, however, can hardly represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that occurs 2-4 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we cultured arteries with bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and studied the contractility of the arteries 1, 3 and 4 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method preserves artery wall structure, prolongs exposure of artery to bloody CSF, and is simple and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cultured rat aorta showed enhanced contractile response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) but reduced response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) 4 days after culturing with bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the contractility of arteries was modified by prolonged incubation with bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations in this study could be important and may explain some aspects of pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
