<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the effect of topical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> on pial arterioles of the mouse, in the presence of locally applied channel blockers and also 15 and 30 minutes after a single i.p. injection of the blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi>, nisoldipine and nimodipine were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effective inhibitors of constriction by either route of administration, and in doses having little or no dilating action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data not only indicate that single systemic doses can effectively alter contractile behavior of cerebral arterioles, but also demonstrate the importance of testing these drugs against receptor mediated constrictors whose effects, alone or in combination, may be important during initiation or maintenance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
