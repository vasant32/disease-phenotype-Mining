<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">Acrolein</z:chebi>, a reactive metabolite produced in many models of mechanical and ischemic injury, has been shown to cause vasospasm in coronary artery and aorta models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These traits suggest it may play a role in post-aSAH <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was designed as a preliminary investigation to determine if <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels could be used as a clinical tool to predict the presence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with aSAH and Hunt and Hess admission grades of III-V were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of vasospasm, defined as a delayed ischaemic neurological deficit in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other possible causes have been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soluble <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels were determined at two times points: early (day 1-3 post-SAH) and late (day 8-12 post-SAH) and the change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels over this period was computed using a Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels over this period between the vasospasm and non-vasospasm group trended toward but did not achieve statistical significance (means: 5.68 versus -5.54; medians: 5.27 versus -3.99; range: -8.067 to 22.904 versus -13.83 to 5.199 p=0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five out of six vasospasm patients showed an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels over the vasospasm period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three out of four non-vasospasm patients showed a decrease over the vasospasm period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> levels increase in patients undergoing vasospasm during the vasospasm window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathways leading up to or following vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is a need for larger more definitive studies </plain></SENT>
