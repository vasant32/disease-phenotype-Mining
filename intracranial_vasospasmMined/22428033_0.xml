<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used synchrotron radiation angiography to study the vasospasm of anterior circulation arteries in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> models in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synchrotron radiation angiography, laser Doppler flowmetry-cerebral blood flow measurement, [(125)I]N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine cerebral blood flow measurement and terminal examinations were applied to evaluate the changes of anterior circulation arteries in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> models made by blood injection into cisterna magna and prechiasmatic cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using synchrotron radiation angiography technique, we detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> rats compared to the controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also identified two interesting findings: 1) both middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery shrunk the most at day 3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>; 2) the diameter of anterior cerebral artery in the prechiasmatic cistern injection group was smaller than that in the cisterna magna injection group (p&lt;0.05), but not for middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that synchrotron radiation angiography provided a novel technique, which could directly evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in small animal experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The courses of vasospasm in these two injection models are similar; however, the model produced by prechiasmatic cistern injection is more suitable for study of anterior circulation vasospasm </plain></SENT>
