<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate histologic changes before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In seven monkeys, vasospasm was induced in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopic studies were performed in vasospastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two animals, vasospasm was induced but angioplasty was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The controls were two animals without vasospasm who underwent only contralateral angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiography after vasospasm revealed marked narrowing but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, without changes in distal spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specimens after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> showed platelets that covered denuded endothelium, stretching, and focal dehiscence of internal elastic lamina and altered myocytes in media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocytes were deformed and arranged irregularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prolonged effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> may be caused by mechanical damage of myocytes and the nonuniformity of histologic changes in vascular walls </plain></SENT>
