<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We showed that normovolaemic induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> therapy was effective in reducing ischaemic symptoms attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in 41 patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to 25% to 50% above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic arterial blood pressure, we observed that in 17 of 24 cases (71%) neurological deficits improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four cases of haemorrhagic infarction, the blood pressure rose to over 50% of systolic arterial pressure, and a low density area was confirmed on computerized tomography (CT) scan prior to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was therefore not considered when a low density area was revealed on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restriction of fluid input is usually a factor in producing hypovolaemia after a neurosurgical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravascular volume expansion has been reported effective in reversing ischaemic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, according to Poiseuille's equation, increasing blood volume to a state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypervolaemia</z:e> can not enhance flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was raised by increasing perfusion pressure, reducing viscosity, or increasing blood vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravascular volume expansion elevates not only systemic arterial pressure, but also pulmonary artery wedge pressure over 18 mmHg and cardiac index over 2.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> may develop, one should monitor haemodynamic parameters with the Swan-Ganz catheter as a preventive measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We emphasize that normovolaemic induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, maintaining haemodynamics subset 1 of the comparable haemodynamic subsets, is effective in raising perfusion pressure of CBF </plain></SENT>
