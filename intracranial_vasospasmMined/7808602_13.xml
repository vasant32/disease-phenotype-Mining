<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of a Phase II clinical trial of intrathecal recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for the prevention of vasospasm were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 53 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), Groups 2 to 4 in Fisher's preoperative computed tomography classification and Grades II to IV in the Hunt-Kosnik classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after surgery, tissue-type plasminogen activator (TD-2061) was intracisternally administered via a catheter (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg, three times daily for 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clot-dissolving effects assessed as "effective" and "markedly effective" were virtually the same in the 0.1- and 0.2-mg groups (66.7% and 64.3%, respectively) but slightly lower (53.3%) in the 0.4-mg group, suggesting an adequate effect in the 0.1- and 0.2-mg groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe angiographic vasospasm was not observed in any of three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No intergroup differences were noted in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, low density on computed tomography 1 month after SAH, and functional prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> complications were noted in 4 patients (7.5%), including 1 case of SAH in the low 0.1-mg group, 2 cases of SAH in the 0.2-mg group, and 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> in the 0.4-mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In overall safety rating, 3 cases with increased SAH and 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> were assessed as "safety doubtful." Other minor side effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and hepatic dysfunction attributed to the effect of other simultaneously used drugs were assessed as "almost safe," and the rate of "almost safe" and "better" for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose groups was about 90%, suggesting a safe dose level for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that repeated intrathecal administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator is useful for preventing vasospasm even in the low dose of 0.1 mg </plain></SENT>
