<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Half maximum activation by endothelin-1 was observed at 1 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The action of endothelin-1 was not mimicked by low concentrations of endothelin-3 and it was largely suppressed by BQ-123, suggesting the involvement of an <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor subtype </plain></SENT>
