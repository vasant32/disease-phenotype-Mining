<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients under-going intracranial aneurysmal surgery were prospectively randomized into two groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">Isoflurane</z:chebi> (group A, n = 15) and nimodipine (group B, n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients in group A were maintained with 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia during the whole procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients in group B were given nimodipine infusion continuously (20 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) after induction of anesthesia and anesthetized with 1 MAC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S100B levels in cerebrospinal fluid were determined before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping and 0, 2, 4 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment of mean blood flow velocity of parent arterial and arterial branches were performed before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) S100B in cerebrospinal fluid was increased significantly at 4 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped in group A (F = 4.11, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, S100B in cerebrospinal fluid was stable in group B in the whole procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) Mean arterial flow velocity of parent vessels in group B was lower significantly than that in group A (t = 2.08, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, mean arterial flow velocity of distal vessels in both groups has no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoperative nimodipine infusion may prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
