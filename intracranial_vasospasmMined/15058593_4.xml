<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of five 1,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>, nitrendipine, felodipine, lacidipine and lercanidipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These drugs are widely used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> and the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasms</z:e> of various origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chromatographic separation was performed on a Supelcosil LC ABZ + Plus C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi>-10 mM <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> buffer (72:28, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temperature was set at 30 +/- 0.2 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amperometric detector, equipped with a glassy carbon electrode was operated at +1100 mV versus Ag/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30341">AgCl</z:chebi> in the direct current mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these chromatographic conditions, the drugs eluted in less than 12 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method showed to be linear over the range 4.5-15 microg/ml with a within-day and day-to-day repeatabilities in terms of R.S.D. lower than 15%, an accuracy greater than 98% and detection limits varying from 90 ng/ml (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>) to 1.55 microg/ml (nitrendipine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method was successfully applied to commercially available pharmaceuticals with relative errors lower than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The validity of the method was examined comparing the results obtained with those of HPLC with photometric detection </plain></SENT>
