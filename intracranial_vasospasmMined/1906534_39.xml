<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated that intracisternal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) can facilitate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clearing of blood from the subarachnoid space and prevent or ameliorate delayed arterial spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of a preliminary Phase I trial of intracisternal rt-PA in 10 patients are reported with documented aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients enrolled were classified as clinical Grade III or IV (according to Hunt and Hess) with thick clots or layers of blood in the basal cisterns and major cerebral fissures (Fisher Grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ventriculostomy and surgery for clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were performed within 48 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, 10 mg rt-PA was instilled into the subarachnoid cisterns prior to closing the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining nine patients, a small <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> catheter was left in the subarachnoid space and rt-PA (5 mg in four cases or 1.5 mg (0.5 mg every 8 hours for three infusions) in five cases) was instilled 12 to 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor local <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving 5 or 10 mg rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oozing was noted at the operative incision site in four of five patients and at the ventriculostomy site in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> that was treated by delayed drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications were noted in the patients receiving the lower regimen of rt-PA (three infusions of 0.5 mg each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serial coagulation studies demonstrated no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels for 24 to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up cerebral angiography 7 to 8 days after rupture disclosed mild to moderate spasm in nine patients, while one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from a posterior inferior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had severe focal spasm of the vertebral arteries that was not symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that postoperative treatment with rt-PA may be effective in reducing the severity of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of serial t-PA levels suggest that the lower dosage regimen with divided dosages at 8-hour intervals is well tolerated and that even lower dosages may be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are clearly indicated </plain></SENT>
