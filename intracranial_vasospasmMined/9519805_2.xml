<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ET-1 at 40 pmol apparently constricted the basilar artery in anesthetized dogs and caused various grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002169'>clonus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> and other features in conscious dogs, partially mimicking those which have been reported for conscious rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>S-0139 could completely inhibit both the vasoconstriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It could also alleviate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> caused by ET-1 in conscious dogs when given after the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that ET-1 in the subarachnoid space produces <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> via endothelin ET(A)-receptor mediation similar to its cerebral vasoconstricting action, at least, in dogs </plain></SENT>
