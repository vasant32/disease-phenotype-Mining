<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups were designated for this study: control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-saline infusion group, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was created by intracisternal injection of autologous blood in New Zealand rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the fourth day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, latency and amplitude of motor evoked potentials were recorded during intracarotid saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion, and compared with motor evoked potential parameters of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Motor evoked potential latencies were increased, and amplitudes were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals before saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion on the fourth day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease in latencies as well as an increase in motor evoked potential amplitudes was observed with short-term intracarotid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracarotid short term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion significantly improves motor evoked potential parameters after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
