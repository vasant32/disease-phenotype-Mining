<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler sonography study, performed during the phase with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the other neurological deficits, suggested the presence of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, which normalized when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms regressed completely (&lt;24 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We speculated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> might represent the trigger factor of these particular phenomena, by acting either directly on distal cerebral vessels, or under certain predisposing conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> attacks </plain></SENT>
