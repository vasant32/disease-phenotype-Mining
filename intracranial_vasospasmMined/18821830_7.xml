<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following receipt of institutional review board approval, the authors reviewed the records of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who had been admitted between 2004 and 2005 and underwent TCD ultrasonography and SPECT evaluations within 24 hours of cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized based on the presence or absence of vasospasm and/or hypoperfusion in the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs), middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>), and basilar arteries (BAs) or posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi>) according to each imaging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of an angiographically demonstrated vasospasm also detected on TCD ultrasonography and SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients (101 women) with a mean age (+/- standard deviation) of 53 +/- 13 years were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ACA, the OR of a vasospasm on TCD ultrasonography was 27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3-243) and on SPECT 0.97 (95% CI 0.36-2.6); in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, 17 (95% CI 5.4-55) and 2.0 (95% CI 0.71-5.5), respectively; in the BA, 4.4 (95% CI 0.72-27) and 5.6 (95% CI 0.89-36), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no substantial change in the relative odds of a vasospasm when the findings on TCD ultrasonography and SPECT were considered jointly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography appears to be highly predictive of an angiographically demonstrated vasospasm in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA; however, its diagnostic accuracy was lower with regard to vasospasm in the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was not predictive of a vasospasm in any of the vascular territories assessed </plain></SENT>
