<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether suppression of the action of endothelium-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-induced cerebroarterial contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dog and monkey cerebral artery strips with and without endothelium were immersed for isometric tension recording in modified Ringer-Locke solution aerated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor, produced concentration-related contraction that was greater in the strips with intact endothelium than in those denuded of endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The D-enantiomer caused no or only a slight contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> elicited additional contraction that is comparable to or even greater than that obtained in the absence of the inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-induced contraction was attenuated by endothelium denudation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the basal release of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> from endothelium results in dog and monkey cerebral arterial contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> action is not a major mechanism involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>-induced contraction; other mechanisms, such as the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi>, appear to be important </plain></SENT>
