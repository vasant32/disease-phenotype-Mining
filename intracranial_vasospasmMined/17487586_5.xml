<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology, and hence most effective treatment, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains unknown, thus this devastating sequela to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> continues to be responsible for significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on abundant and diverse clinical and laboratory observations, we hypothesize that vasospasm and its subsequent resolution result from a short-term chemo-dominated turnover of cells and matrix in evolving vasoconstricted states that produces a narrowed lumen and thicker wall, which is stiffer and largely unresponsive to exogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, and a subsequent mechano-dominated turnover of cells and matrix in evolving vasodilated states that restores the vessel toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a pressing need for a mathematical model of arterial growth and remodeling that can guide the design and interpretation of experiments to test this and competing hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Toward this end, we present a new biochemomechanical framework that couples a 2-D model of the evolving geometry, structure, and properties of the affected arterial wall, a 1-D model of the blood flow within the affected segment, and a 0-D model of the biochemical insult to the segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We submit that such a framework can capture salient features of the time-course of vasospasm and its potential resolution, as illustrated numerically in part II of this paper </plain></SENT>
