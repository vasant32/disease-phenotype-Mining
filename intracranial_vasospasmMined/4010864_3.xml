<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>8 patients suffering from severe head injury (Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 3-5) were treated with the calcium influx blocker nimodipine (2-3 mg/h) for a traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In every case the spasm involved the frontal region of the circle of Willis with the first two segments of the anterior and middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control angiograms, recorded in 6 patients, revealed a dilated or normalized lumen of the vessels that the first angiography had revealed to be spastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracranial and the mean arterial pressure were not altered by nimodipine during simultaneous neurosurgical intensive care therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, relaxation, and controlled respiration for 2-3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of the somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) showed a distinct improvement of the cortical response within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> 8 days after the accident and one remained in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients reached Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores of 13.0 +/- 1.1. within 8.6 +/- 2.2 days, the initial scores having been 4.1 +/- 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One year after their accident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were once again fully able to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival quality was therefore better than that reported in the literature for patients in similar conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude from these preliminary results that calcium influx blockers can be used successfully in the therapy of traumatic vasospasm and of severe head injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A study involving a larger number of patients is currently in progress </plain></SENT>
