<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> resistant to medical management frequently requires intra-arterial spasmolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographic resolution of vasospasm does not provide physiologic data on the adequacy of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded pre- and postspasmolysis PbO(2) data in the endovascular suite to determine whether this physiologic parameter could be used to determine when successful reperfusion was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with 10 Licox monitors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> underwent intra-arterial spasmolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postspasmolytic PbO(2) was recorded for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other physiologic parameters, such as CPP, ICP, SaO(2), and Fio(2), were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean prespasmolysis PbO(2) recordings were 35.2 and 27.3 for the mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe vasospasm group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean postspasmolysis PbO(2) increased to 40.3 and 38.4, respectively, which was statistically significant (P &lt; .05) for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 100% of instances in the moderate-to-severe group and 83% of instances in mild-to-moderate group, the mean PbO(2) increased after spasmolysis and correlated with improvement in angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other physiologic parameters, such as CPP, ICP, SaO(2), and Fio(2), did not show any statistically significant difference before and after spasmolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PbO(2) monitoring provides the interventionalist with an objective physiologic parameter to determine adequate spasmolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to establish target PbO(2) rates indicative of adequate reperfusion, which can be used in the endovascular suite </plain></SENT>
