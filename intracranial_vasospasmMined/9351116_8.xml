<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 24 patients treated with intra-arterial papaverine for vasospasm following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, 12 did not improve clinically after the initial treatment; 9 received second or third infusions on consecutive days; 6 received only a second infusion; and 3 received a third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Superselective infusion into the intracranial arteries was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite angiographic improvement after the initial or second infusions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients showed varying degrees of recurrent vasospasm at the time of the second or third treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 24 h of a second infusion, three of the six patients had significant clinical improvement, and one of these showed marked improvement soon after a third infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results suggest that repeat papaverine infusion may be a way of controlling recurrent or recalcitrant vasospasm </plain></SENT>
