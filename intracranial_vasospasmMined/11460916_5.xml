<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) suggest a breakdown of the balance between the vasoconstrictor and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A shortage of a major cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), has been accused of causing this breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of continuous intracisternal infusion of a NO precursor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi>, in a rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Three experimental groups were designated: Group 1--Cerebral blood flow (CBF) data was obtained via transorbital Doppler ultrasonography (TDU) in 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2--Intracisternal catheter placement and TDU study during saline infusion were performed in 8 animals at the 4th day of SAH, Group 3--SAH occurred in 8 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4 days later, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> was infused intracisternally for 1 hour, while TDU was performed before and during infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF parameters which were obtained via TDU measurement or calculations, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The results of TDU revealed significant vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH animals, as well as resolution of vasospasm with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 20 minutes of infusion, a steady and sustained vasodilation was obtained in the third group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis of CBF data revealed a significant difference in SAH values, and no difference in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our results support the contribution of the "NO shortage" concept in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and overconsumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> during the post-SAH period may cause this shortage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> treatment may be useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The intracisternal infusion method can eliminate the short action time disadvantage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
