<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nimodipine on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700323,C0234119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular blockade</z:e> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> had been given to facilitate tracheal intubation and maintenance of muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> in patients undergoing clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were divided into two groups: a control group (n = 10) who received no calcium channel blocking drug, and a nimodipine group (n = 10) consisting of patients treated with nimodipine at clinically used doses of 0.03 mg kg(-1) h(-1) pre- and perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia was induced with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> 10 microg kg(-1), dehydrobenzperidol 5 mg, fentanyl 5 microg kg(-1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> 5 mg kg(-1) and maintained with a mixture of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (0.5-1% inspired concentration) in O2, and additional doses of fentanyl 2.5 microg kg(-1) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a stabilization period, an intubating dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> 0.1 mg kg(-1) was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action, the time of first appearance of T1 and clinical duration of action were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then, maintenance doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> 0.03 mg kg(-1) were administered twice more when T1 had recovered to 25% of control twitch height </plain></SENT>
