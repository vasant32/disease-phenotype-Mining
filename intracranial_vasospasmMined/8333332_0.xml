<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of 20 kDa MLC was not augmented in the spastic BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Turnover of PC and PE was detectably stimulated on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytosolic PKC activity was down-regulated on days 4 and 7, while the membrane PKC activity remained unchanged during these periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that a process which affected the membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, PKC metabolism and PKC activity occurred in spastic BA </plain></SENT>
