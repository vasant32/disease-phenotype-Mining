<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Worldwide, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has an estimated morbidity and mortality of 1.2 million annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While it has long been suspected that reactive oxygen species play a major role in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, promising results in animal work were not borne out in human clinical trials, despite intensive research effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase in the SAH cerebrospinal fluid milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized commercially available kits for the quantitation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase 1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase) activity and oxygen radical capacity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis with Western blotting with specific antibodies to human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase to determine the enzyme content of the cerebrospinal fluid samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in an Institutional Review Board-exempt manner for this study in the following groups: control (no SAH), CSF(C) (SAH but no vasospasm on angiography) and CSF(V) (SAH with clinical and angiographic vasospasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity is significantly higher in CSF(V) compared with CSF(C), and this is reflected in a higher total oxidative capacity in CSF(V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite similar levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase protein, CSF(V) had significantly greater activity than CSF(C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These results further elucidate previous research from this laboratory, showing increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in CSF(V) compared with CSF(C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there appears to be <z:mp ids='MP_0011602'>increased glutathione peroxidase activity</z:mp> in CSF(V), despite there being increased levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers, suggesting overwhelming <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
