<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> is increased in spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Degradation of platelets liberates mediators, which in turn increase vasospasm, thus creating a vicious cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy vessels cope with this by increasing the synthesis of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to increase experimentally the levels of arterial prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) in animals through intraarterial injection of these substances because they are lower in spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin promotes antiaggregation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, increases blood flow, inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>, and prevents synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of these effects were done by increasing cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After injecting autogenous blood into the cisterna magna of male dogs, both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases of vasospasm and the degenerative changes in the arterial wall were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injecting ATP increased the severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During vasospasm it was found that when prostacyclin is used intraarterially, vasodilatation began, but degeneration of the arterial wall could not be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group of animals in which both ATP and prostacyclin were used, there was no degeneration of the arterial wall and the basilar artery was seen to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when viewed under the electron microscope </plain></SENT>
