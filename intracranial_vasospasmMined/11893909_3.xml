<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, reversal of the vasospastic response was not very efficacious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effects of a highly selective ECE-1 inhibitor, CGS 35066, on SAH-induced cerbrovasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by injecting autogenous blood into cisterna magna and CGS 35066 was injected i.v. twice daily, either at 1 h (prevention protocol) or 24 h (reversal protocol) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS 35066 significantly attenuated basilar arterial narrowing at a dose of 1 mg/kg in both protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provide support for the use of selective ECE-1 inhibitors for the treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm even after the process of arterial narrowing has begun </plain></SENT>
