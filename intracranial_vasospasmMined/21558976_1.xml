<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is widely accepted to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH); however, its predictive value remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive reliability of an increase in the mean blood flow velocity (mBFV) ratio of the ipsilateral to contralateral middle cerebral arteries (I/C mBFV) compared with the conventional absolute flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical and radiologic data of consecutive patients with SAH admitted from July 2003 to August 2009 who underwent TCD ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest mBFV value in bilateral middle cerebral arteries was recorded, while delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) was defined as neurological deficits or computed tomographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral side was defined as the side with higher mBFV value when evaluating the I/C mBFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus elucidated the reliability of this rate in comparison with the conventional method for predicting DCI with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and forty-two patients were retrospectively analyzed with specific data from 1262 TCD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve showed that the overall predictive value for DCI had an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.96) when the I/C mBFV was used vs 0.80 (0.71-0.88) when the absolute flow velocity was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The threshold value that best discriminated between patients with and without DCI was I/C mBFV of 1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with SAH, the I/C mBFV demonstrated a more significant correlation to vasospasm than the absolute mean flow velocity </plain></SENT>
