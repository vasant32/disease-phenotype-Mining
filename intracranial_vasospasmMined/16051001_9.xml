<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) has come into wide use for management of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term effects of TBA in this clinical context on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the functional properties of the arterial wall after aneurysmal SAH remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent unilateral TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computed tomography was performed for an average of 18 days after TBA to measure CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and CVR were compared between the side of TBA and the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen vascular territories were treated successfully with TBA in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic improvement of vasospasm was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients, and 9 (75%) patients showed neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After balloon angioplasty, global CBF was 35.1 +/- 8.2 mL/100 g per minute, with CBF on the side with TBA (37.8 +/- 10.3 mL/100 g per minute) being essentially the same as that on the other side (P = .0671, paired Student t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> did not differ significantly between sides (P = .0817) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transluminal balloon angioplasty increased proximal vessel diameters but showed no significant influence on CBF or vascular reactivity 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Benefits presumably were short term, but the procedure was clinically safe </plain></SENT>
