<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of clot removal on multiple outcome variables following the clipping of ruptured anterior communicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2007 to 2011, 30 patients with Fisher grade III aneurysmal SAH underwent clipping of an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> before SAH day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 20 women and 10 men, mean age 53.4, range 28-80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen underwent fenestration of lamina terminalis and cisternal removal of clots (group A), and 13 did not (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical grades, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> at admission, treatment modality, occurrence of clinical vasospasm, the need for interventional vasospasm therapy, and need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Vasospasm affected 5 of 17 (29%) in group A and 8 of 13 (61.5%) in group B (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment for vasospasm was required in one patient in group A (5.8% of 17, 20% of 5) and in five from group B (38.4% of 13, 62.5% of 8) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was observed in one case in group A (5.8% of 17, 20% of 5) and in two cases in group B (15.3% of 13, 25% of 8) and was related to vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ventriculoperitonal shunt (VPS) was required in one case in group A (5.8%) and in five cases in group B (38.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fenestration of the lamina terminalis and removal of cisternal clots significantly decreased the incidence of post-SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and was associated with better outcomes in our series </plain></SENT>
