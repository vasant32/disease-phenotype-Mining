<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intraarterial papaverine infusions are performed to reverse cerebral arterial vasospasm resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, but such infusions may lead to increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine when ICP monitoring is indicated during papaverine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight vessels were treated in 51 sessions in 28 patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICP, papaverine doses, and infusion rates were recorded during treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedural data, Hunt and Hess scores, Fisher grades, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores, and ages for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline ICP ranged from 0 to 34 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With typical papaverine doses of 300 mg per territory and infusion times ranging from 5 to 60 minutes per vessel, ICP increases above baseline during papaverine infusion ranged from 0 to 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant (&gt; or = 20 mm Hg) ICP increases during therapy were observed even in patients with low baseline ICP and with papaverine infused at the slowest rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a baseline ICP of more than 15 mm Hg were much more likely to have significant ICP increases than were patients with a baseline ICP of 0 to 15 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hunt and Hess scores, Fisher grades, age, and Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores on admission and immediately before treatment did not correlate with ICP increases during papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICP increases of more than 10 mm Hg during therapy were more likely to experience adverse clinical events than were patients with ICP increases of &lt; or = 10 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reduction in the rate of papaverine infusion, or termination of infusion, resulted in reversal of drug-induced ICP elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICP monitoring during intraarterial papaverine infusions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and is particularly important for patients with elevated baseline ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Continuous ICP monitoring facilitates safe and time-efficient drug delivery </plain></SENT>
