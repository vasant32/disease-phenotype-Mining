<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through multivariate analysis we determined the independent prognostic factors of the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH in a study cohort of 244 patients undergoing either surgical or endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors of sequelae after aneurysmal SAH were studied as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Symptomatic vasospasm was defined as the association of deterioration in a patient's neurological condition between 3 and 14 days after SAH with no other explanation and an increase in mean transcranial Doppler velocities of &gt;120 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors were registered on admission and during the intensive care stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 22.2% surgical patients compared with 17.2% endovascular treatment patients (P=0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the probability of occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm decreased with age &gt;50 years (relative risk [RR], 0.47 [0.25 to 0.88]) and severe World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade measured on admission (RR, 0.43 [0.20 to 0.90]) and increased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> occurring during the intensive care stay (RR, 1.94 [1.04 to 3.63]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in risk of symptomatic vasospasm could be identified between surgical and endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm (OR, 4.73 [CI, 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>77 to 12.6]) as well as WFNS grade of &gt;2 (OR, 8.95 [3.46 to 23.2]), treatment complications (OR, 8.39 [3.16 to 22.3]), and secondary brain insults were associated with an increased risk of 6-month sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age &lt;50 years, good neurological grade, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> whereas treatment was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This provides a basis for future clinical prospective randomized trials comparing both treatments </plain></SENT>
