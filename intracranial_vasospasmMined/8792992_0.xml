<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether this new vasoconstrictor has any effect on regulation of the cerebral circulation, we measured plasma ETL-1 concentrations in patients undergoing carotid revascularization and attempted to correlate the variations of venous and arterial plasma ETL-1 with the characteristics of the procedure, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 11 patients undergoing a total of 14 carotid surgical revascularization procedures (12 endarterectomies, 2 polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts from the common to the internal carotid arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before carotid cross-clamping, blood samples were drawn from the internal jugular vein and the healthy common carotid artery proximal to the occlusive lesion to be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endarterectomy, blood samples were withdrawn from the internal, external, and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the release of the last clamp, a final aliquot of blood was withdrawn from the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After plasma extraction on a C2-ethyl microcolumn, plasma endothelin-like immunoreactivity was measured by means of radioimmunoassay with a polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 11 patients, internal jugular vein ETL-1 concentration decreased statistically significantly after carotid artery cross-clamping (4.2 +/- 1.4 pg/ml vs. 3.9 +/- 1.1 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 2 patients in whom ETL-1 levels failed to drop, a shunt was used during the procedure in 1, and the other was the only patient who had an ipsilateral ischemic postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in internal jugular vein ETL-1 concentration failed to correlate with any of the cross-clamping times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of arterial blood ETL-1 remained steady in the common carotid artery before and after cross-clamping (4.5 +/- 1.5 pg/ml vs. 4.6 +/- 0.9 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A small, nonsignificant decrease in ETL-1 level was noted in the external and internal carotid arteries after cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease in internal jugular vein ETL-1 levels may in part reflect a compensatory response to carotid artery cross-clamping, which could limit the reduction of local cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
