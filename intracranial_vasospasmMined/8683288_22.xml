<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients (45 males and 22 females) aged 2 to 70 years (mean 36 years) who had suffered closed head injury were investigated with daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 470 TCD recordings (mean 7) were made during Days 1 to 14 after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities were determined in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (40%) of the 67 patients demonstrated traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (tSAH) on the first computerized tomography (CT) scan after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities exceeded 100 cm/second in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven (41%) of the 27 patients who showed tSAH on the first CT scan developed velocities greater than 100 cm/second, as compared to 11 (28%) of 40 patients without tSAH on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients in whom a thick layer of tSAH was revealed on the first CT scan had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocities exceeding 200 cm/second for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) were performed in six tSAH patients who showed TCD flow velocities exceeding 120 cm/second (uni- or bilaterally) to determine whether the increase in velocity reflected vasospasm or hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SPECT studies verified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in five patients but revealed general hyperemia in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bilateral increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocities in the latter case was due to high-volume flow through the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> secondary to elevated CBF rather than arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient with a thick layer of subarachnoid blood on a CT scan obtained at admission, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocities exceeded 220 cm/second bilaterally on Day 8 after the head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A SPECT measurement obtained on the same day reflected bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this patient flow velocities decreased, with a corresponding normalization of CBF, after 5 days of intravenous nimodipine administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/ICA ratio correlated well with the distribution of CBF in the six patients studied using SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that vasospasm is an important secondary posttraumatic insult in patients suffering severe head injury and, in some cases, is probably treatable by administration of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
