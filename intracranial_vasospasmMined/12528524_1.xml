<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes of somatosensory evoked potential(SEP) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>(SAH), and the influence of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rats in sham-operated group, SAH model group and EGb-treated group underwent measurement of dynamic changes of regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF), SEP and NO levels both in serum and in brain tissue within 24 h after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In SAH group, rCBF decreased immediately after operation, with no tendency to recover within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latency of SEP delayed progressively from 1 h to 24 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NO levels in serum and in brain tissue decreased and increased respectively from 1 h to 24 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGb effectively antagonized the changes of above parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SEP is helpful in the judgement on brain ischemic damage after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decrease of NO in serum and increase of that in brain tissue may lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and ischemic brain damage respectively after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGb relieves SAH-induced brain ischemic damage by reversing the pathological alterations of NO </plain></SENT>
