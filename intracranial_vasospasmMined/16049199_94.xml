<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase II randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pravastatin treatment could improve cerebrovascular autoregulation and reduce vasospasm-related complications after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 80 aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) patients (18 to 84 years of age) within 72 hours from the ictus were randomized equally to receive either oral pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo daily for up to 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the incidence, duration, and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and duration of impaired autoregulation estimated from transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the incidence of vasospasm-related delayed ischemic deficits (DIDs) and disability at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prerandomization characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of vasospasm and severe vasospasm were reduced by 32% (P=0.006) and 42% (P=0.044), respectively, and the duration of severe vasospasm was shortened by 0.8 days (P=0.068) in the pravastatin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These measurements were maximal on the ipsilateral side of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of impaired autoregulation was shortened bilaterally (P&lt; or =0.01), and the incidence of vasospasm-related DIDs and mortality were decreased by 83% (P&lt;0.001) and 75% (P=0.037), respectively, in the pravastatin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> treatment with pravastatin after aSAH is safe and ameliorates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, improves cerebral autoregulation, and reduces vasospasm-related DID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable outcome at discharge was reduced primarily because of a reduction in overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of clinical benefits with immediate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disorder </plain></SENT>
