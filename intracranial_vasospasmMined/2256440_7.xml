<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured using the intra-arterial 133-Xe clearance technique within one hour of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between regional CBF and diameter of major supplying vessel was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the 13 cases with focal vasospasm the reduction in CBF was global and not restricted to the area of the spastic vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral oxygen extraction was reduced but independent of the degree of vasospasm, speaking against vasospasm as the cause for the reduction in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed association between reduction in CBF and vasospasms could be caused by a common factor responsible for development of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is proposed that the amount of blood escaping at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture determines 1) the amount of reduction in cerebral oxygen uptake and thereby the reduction in CBF and 2) the degree of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If so a correlation, yet not causal, between reduction in CBF and degree of vasospasm, will be observed </plain></SENT>
