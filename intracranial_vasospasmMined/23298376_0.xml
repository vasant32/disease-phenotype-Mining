<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm plays a major role in the morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preliminary studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in preventing clinical vasospasm and improving functional outcome in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with aSAH admitted within 96 h of ictus were randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> or placebo - 80 mg/day for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty eight patients were recruited in the study- 19 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> and 19 placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent surgical clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of the study was the development of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes included Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) and Barthel Index Score (MBI) at follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>16% of the patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group had high Middle Cerebral Artery velocities (&gt; 160 cm/sec) on transcranial Doppler on one or more than one day during the study duration as compared to 26% of the patients in the placebo group (p = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration occurred in 26% and 42% of the patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group versus placebo group, respectively (p = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
