<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As our recent study showed that tenascin-C (TN-C), an extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which is up-regulated in inflammatory states and is associated with tissue remodeling, causes vasospasm-like changes in arterial walls, we examined whether TN-C might be induced in relation to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> experimentally and clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, rat models were produced by means of a single cisternal injection of either autologous arterial blood or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for TN-C was performed with basilar arteries obtained from non-operated rats (n=3) and on days 1-4 in SAH (n=18) or saline-injected (n=12) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, levels of TN-C were prospectively measured in serum in 31 consecutive patients diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH on days 1-12 and compared between those with and without subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In SAH rats, marked induction of TN-C immunoreactivity was shown throughout the vasospastic arterial wall, especially in the smooth muscle cell layers, in comparison with control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a clinical study, serum TN-C levels increased transiently, the extent being significantly greater in patients with subsequent vasospasm; the peak occurred 2.4 days before an increase in the mean transcranial Doppler velocity to &gt; or =120 cm/s and 3.6 days before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This is the first study suggesting TN-C increases with close linkage to the occurrence of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
