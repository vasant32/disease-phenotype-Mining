<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The number of elderly people is markedly increasing in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the epidemiology and management outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in elderly patients aged &gt; or = 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 3100 patients were enrolled in the Yamaguchi Data Bank of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Cerebral Aneurysm</z:hpo> between 1985 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 598 with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and 120 with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were elderly (ie, aged &gt; or = 70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> has markedly increased since 1991, and in 1995 approximately 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, the proportion of patients with severe neurological grade did not change and that with an unfavourable outcome did not decrease throughout the 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with severe neurological grade in the elderly group was higher than in the younger group (&lt; 70 years), and the management outcome of elderly patients for each neurological grade on admission was worse than that of younger patients (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence rate of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and rebleeding was the same for the two age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eventually, 60.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elderly patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> had an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, 63.3% of the selected elderly patients were surgically treated, and the surgical morbidity and mortality rates were 26.3% and 4.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These rates were nonsignificantly higher than those for younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> has markedly increased in Yamaguchi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the unsatisfactory management outcome of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and surgical outcome of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in elderly patients during the 11-year period, we propose the treatment of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> at a younger age and the use of a screening system to detect these subjects </plain></SENT>
