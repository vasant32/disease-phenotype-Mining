<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many compounds have been identified in CSF from SAH patients: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">Thromboxanes A2</z:chebi> and B2, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandins</z:chebi> F2 alpha, E2 and D2 are the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi> incriminated in the causation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have monitored the CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> concentrations with serial lumbar punctures at different intervals from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 16 patients admitted for SAH: <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> was measured with radioimmunoassay as its 9-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi> derivative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lumbar CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> concentration ranges from 0.11 to 1.53 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases vasospasm was angiographically demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>9 patients presented no clinical or radiological evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases cisternal CSF samples were available at the operation by cisternal punctures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> concentration and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 7 cases with evidence of vasospasm a significant increase of CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> corresponded to neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 cases without evidence of vasospasm CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> concentration trend was in a steady-state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cisternal CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> concentration was higher than lumbar CSF concentration in cases with arterial spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests the importance of the clotting phenomenon in vasospasm <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp> is one of the most important spasmogens in clotted blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although its role in the genesis of vasospasm <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> remains to be defined, its vasospastic action, in addition to that of other analogous compounds, seems to be relevant </plain></SENT>
