<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteries to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteries displayed a supersensitivity to these <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi>, which was most marked 3 days after the experiment and then gradually disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The supersensitivity to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> was greater and longer than the response to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in the vascular contractile response induced by SAH was similar to that seen after superior cervical ganglionectomy or intracisternal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that supersensitivity to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> induced by SAH may be involved in the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
