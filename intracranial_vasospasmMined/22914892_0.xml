<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of patients with CV treated by 2 endovascular procedures: intra-arterial nimodipine angioplasty (IANA) and balloon angioplasty (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 2008 and June 2011, we performed 22 IANA and 8 BA in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 44 years and 60% was female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients, the treatment was clipping, whereas 13 underwent coil treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CV was severe in 63%, moderate in 30%, and mild in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good outcome between 2 groups was similar (P = .36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome according to the subgroups of CV severity and modality treatment was equivalent (P = .22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality at 3 months was 16% and 20% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences in the clinical outcome despite the fact that both techniques produce adequate angiographic resolution of CV </plain></SENT>
