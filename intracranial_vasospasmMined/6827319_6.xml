<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow, measured by the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 washout technique, decreased from a control value of 49.5 +/- 1.17 ml/100 gm/min to an experimental value of 34.1 +/- 1.65 ml/100 gm/min at 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral vascular resistance rose from a control value of 2.05 +/- 0.17 PRU (peripheral resistance units) to an experimental value of 2.91 +/- 0.25 PRU at 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, intracranial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output also fell significantly (in 2-hour control animals it was 2.89 +/- 0.37 liter/min, and in 2-hour experimental animals 1.43 +/- 0.13 liter/min) and peripheral vascular resistance rose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were evident by 10 minutes after the cisternal injection of the hemolysate protein, and remained for the duration of the 2-hour monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial vertebrobasilar angiograms demonstrated marked narrowing of the intracranial basilar artery when compared to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The narrowing persisted for several days in most animals, and tended to increase with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relaxation occurred by the 10th through the 14th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that this experimental preparation may be a useful model for both in vitro and in vivo investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
