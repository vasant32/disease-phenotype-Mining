<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methodological parameters have not been analyzed to validate this model and associated neurological deficits have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We introduce a technique to quantify DCV and associated neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6J mice were subjected to SAH or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours later, the vasculature was cast in situ with India ink/gelatin at perfusion pressures of 40-60, 60-80, or 100-120 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were perfused with and without microfiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional mice underwent grading of SAH size, measurement of vascular diameters, and neurological examination (score range 5-27; 27= <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When cast at 60-80 mmHg, SAH was associated with an intraluminal cross-sectional diameter reduction in 3 of 7 ipsilateral vascular segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 40-60 mmHg, the diameter of only one segment was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed at 100-120 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Emboli prevented adequate perfusion of vascular segments in the absence of microfiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median (interquartile range) neurologic score was reduced after SAH (sham, 27(27); SAH 11(7-17)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Deficits correlated with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) diameter and SAH grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameter also correlated with SAH grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only when utilizing microfiltration, controlling for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> size, and casting at perfusion pressures of 60-80 mmHg does India ink/gelatin vascular casting demonstrate consistent DCV that correspnds to neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This allows measurement of both anatomical and clinical DCV in the mouse </plain></SENT>
