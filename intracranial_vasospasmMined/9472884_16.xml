<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) is used after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and is often treated with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral autoregulation, however, may be disturbed in this population, raising the possibility that TCD velocities may be elevated by induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study this possibility, we performed continuous TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during the induction and withdrawal of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were studied during the induction and withdrawal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> using primarily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous monitoring was performed on the middle cerebral artery with the highest flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was based on rising TCD velocities or clinical evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure and mean TCD velocities were recorded every minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A change of &gt; 15% from starting TCD values was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral autoregulation was calculated as a percentage of intact autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were subsequently divided into groups of disturbed and intact autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 of 19 patients (53%), TCD velocities changed by &gt; 15% and paralleled changes in mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This directly altered the TCD interpretation of the grade of vasospasm in 7 of 19 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three additional patients had smaller absolute changes in TCD velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No clinical difference could be identified between patients with disturbed and intact autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with disturbed autoregulation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can alter cerebral blood flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The level of autoregulation needs to be considered when interpreting TCD velocities in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
