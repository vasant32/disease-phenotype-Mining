<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thorough medical inquiries revealed strong histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headaches</z:hpo> in the parents of 13 severely deaf children (mean age: 7 years) and two of them also presented symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disease is viewed as a form of a relatively benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> causing an intense transitory vasodilatation of the small vessels of the brain and a subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liberation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and plasma kinins appear to interfere with the metabolism of nerve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children in our study had suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> at birth, a condition related to a depopulation of cochlear brainstem nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraines</z:hpo> may therefore produce obvious hearing symptoms when vasomotor disturbances occur in already damaged <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8500">propranolol hydrochloride</z:chebi> (HCl), a potent beta-blocker, resulted in cessation of hearing fluctuations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in an improvement of thresholds in two of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We presented our results, as well as preliminary studies on asphyxiated rats shortly after birth, with transitory artificially induced cerebral vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
