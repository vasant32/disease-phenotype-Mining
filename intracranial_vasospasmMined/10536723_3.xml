<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Is there an increase in the concentration of PDGF-AB following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Is the increase in concentration related to the angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "double haemorrhage" model was applied in seven dogs to produce experimental SAH with determination of angiographic vasospasm in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood and CSF samples were taken on the first, third and eighth days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analyses were performed with an ELISA human PDGF-AB antibody kit (quantikine human PDGF-AB, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average PDGF-AB base value in the serum on the day before the SAH was 410.77 +/- 177.56 pg/ml, in the CSF it was 6.43 +/- 3.19 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant (p = 0.05) increase in the concentration of PDGF-AB (third day 717.35 pg/ml, eighth day 918.07 pg/ml) in the serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant increase was found in the CSF samples of any animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, a PDGF-AB like immune reactivity was found in the serum of dogs with the human PDGF-AB ELISA kit and the concentration of PDGF-AB in the serum increased after experimental SAH but not in CSF, but there was no relationship between the increase in PDGF-AB serum concentration and angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
