<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the gap junctional blockers would inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH with injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna on days 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37868">Octanol</z:chebi> or carbenoxolone was administered intracisternally on day 3, and repeated on days 4 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed before (day 0) and 7 days after (day 7) SAH, and the diameter of the basilar artery was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paraffin blocks of brain tissues were prepared and sectioned for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining for morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing in SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37868">octanol</z:chebi> group and SAH + carbenoxolone group at day 7 was significantly less than that in SAH-only group and each SAH + vehicle group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Less morphologic changes in SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37868">octanol</z:chebi> group and SAH + carbenoxolone group were observed when compared to that in SAH-only group and each SAH + vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blotting showed that carbenoxolone down-regulated Cx43 protein expression in the BA, which in the SAH-only group was significantly higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gap junction blockers attenuate the experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and down-regulate the increase in expression of Cx43 protein after SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that gap junctions play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
