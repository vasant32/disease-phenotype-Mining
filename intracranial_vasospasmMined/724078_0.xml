<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been said that vasospasm would occur in early days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But in this paper, in the cases with only one history of SAH, vasospasm occurred within 3 days after SAH was seen in only 4.2% of the 120 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peak of vasospasm on angiography was seen in the period between 10 and 17 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this period vasospasm was seen in 49.1% of the 116 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, in the cases with preceding SAH occurred between 1 and 17 days before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the last SAH, vasopasm occurred within 3 days after the last SAH was seen in 38.7% of the 62 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, during the period between 10 and 17 days after the last SAH, vasospasm was seen in only 20% of the 25 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preceding SAH occurred between 1 and 17 days before the last SAH seemed to be responsible for the high rate of vasospasm within 3 days after the last SAH and the low rate of vasospasm in the period between 10 and 17 days after the last SAH </plain></SENT>
