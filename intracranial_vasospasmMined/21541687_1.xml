<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated CT angiography (CTA) as a non-invasive alternative for diagnosis of CV and assessed if CTA could have a role in choosing appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with SAH and suspected vasospasm were included when DSA was performed within 24Â h from CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two neuro-radiologists retrospectively analysed CTA and DSA studies independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment included presence of central and peripheral vasospasm and grading of severity of central CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A treatment recommendation based on CTA was compared to actual treatment received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final analysis included 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTA was more accurate for diagnosis of central then for peripheral CV with high sensitivity (reader 1, 91%; reader 2, 92%), specificity (reader 1, 73%; reader 2, 90%), accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for central vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For grading the severity of CV CTA's sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were high for most central arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reader's recommendation of angioplasty according to CTA was significantly predictive of actual receipt of angioplasty but overestimated actual receipt of triple H treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA is adequate for detecting central vasospasm in symptomatic SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A negative result should not prevent further investigation especially when evaluating arterial segments adjacent to metal artefacts from coils or clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CTA is helpful in treatment decision making specifically regarding the need for balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
