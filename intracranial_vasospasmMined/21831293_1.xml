<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, our purpose was to identify risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after BAVM rupture in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients admitted to our ICU from January 2003 to May 2010 for BAVM rupture were included in this observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, laboratory and radiological features from admission to ICU discharge were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by transcranial Doppler (TCD-VS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at ICU discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,734 patients admitted to our ICU during the study period, 72 (2.6%) with ruptured BAVM were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD-VS occurred in 12 (17%) and CI in 6 (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CI had a previous diagnosis of TCD-VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;8 was a risk factor for both TCD-VS (relative risk (RR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.6 to 26) and CI (RR, 7.8; 95% CI, 0.1 to 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for TCD-VS by multivariate analysis were lower Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score (odds ratio (OR) per unit decrease, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.80), female gender (OR, 4.86; 95% CI, 1.09 to 25.85), and younger age (OR per decade decrease, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of a poor outcome (GOS &lt;4) at ICU discharge was non-significantly increased in the patients with TCD-VS (RR, 4.9; 95% CI, 0.7 to 35; P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients with CI had poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first cohort study describing the incidence and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after BAVM rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to investigate the significance of TCD-vasospasm and CI in these patients </plain></SENT>
