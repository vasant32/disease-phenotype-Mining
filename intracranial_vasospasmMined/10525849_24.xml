<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxyHb) is deemed to be the principal cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the mechanism(s) whereby it leads to vasospasm is by no means clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of importance is the fact that prolonged contraction of arterial smooth muscle is not the sole feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, particularly in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm is also associated with the occurrence of organic changes in the arterial wall as well as the derangement of cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These additional features may play a pivotal role when vasospasm in the proximal arteries incurs delayed ischemic neurological deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The question then arises as to whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of vasospasm are attributable to the actions of oxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this regard, owing to the recent advances in vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, it has become clear that the cerebral vasculature should be regarded as an organ, not a mere conduit, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intracellular mechanisms are functionally integrated for the maintenance and regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the sense that the arterial function is not simply a sum of the individual cellular functions, it may be described as "holistic" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to extant literature, oxyHb has multifarious actions that can be divided into the following three categories: (1) scavenging of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), (2) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (3) activation of the tyrosine kinase/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated kinase (TK/MAPK) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on such knowledge, the present review aims at a speculative synthesis in terms of how oxyHb pertains to the occurrence of vasospasm, in which the highly integrated, holistic mechanisms within the cerebral artery are perturbed for a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
