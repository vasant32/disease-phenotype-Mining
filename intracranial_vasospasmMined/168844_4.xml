<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cat, the basilar artery was exposed by a transclival approach and spasm induced by the application of blood to the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the monkey, spasm was produced by injecting blood into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel size was determined in the cat by direct observation and, in the monkey, by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several agents known to alter the synthsis and degradation of cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) were used to modity the vasospasm produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> (Norisodrine) and aminophyline were effective in reversing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> when applied topically and when administered parenterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that manipulation of the cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> pathways may be an effective method of controlling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
