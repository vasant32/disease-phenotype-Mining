<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical cardiovascular side effects have limited the dose in neurology and neurosurgery to 0.03 mg/kg X h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the influence of an infusion of high dose nimodipine (0.09 mg/kg X h) on haemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>52 patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery and prospectively randomised in a nimodipine group and a control group having received 0.9% saline solution as placebo were investigated at 3 different times: 1. before induction of anaesthesia (n = 6) 2. during anaesthesia (n = 10) 3. during extracorporeal circulation (ECC n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predominant effect of high-dose nimodipine was a decrease in total systemic resistance (TSR), followed by a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a significant increase in cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic effects were much more pronounced during anaesthesia in comparison to patients before induction of anaesthesia, thus demonstrating an interaction between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anaesthetics</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate (HR -9.3%) and dp/dtmax (-17%) showed a decrease, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in MAP and HR in connection with a decrease in left ventricular pressure (-21.9%) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (-42.8%) indicate a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increasing dosage of nimodipine is accompanied by increasing cardiovascular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the haemodynamic point of view high dosage of nimodipine seems to be of advantage in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> suffering simultaneously from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
