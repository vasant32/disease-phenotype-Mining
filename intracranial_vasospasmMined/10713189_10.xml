<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic vasospasm is a well-recognized sequela of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk factors associated with post-traumatic vasospasm have not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 119 consecutive patients with head injury to determine the risk factors for post-traumatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine (27.1%) patients were excluded from the study because of poor insonation (n = 12) or a hospital stay of less than 72 hours (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy (77.8%) of 90 patients suffered severe head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (17.8%) patients sustained moderate head injury and four (4.4%) patients sustained mild head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored with transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Post-traumatic vasospasm was detected in 32 (35.6%) of 90 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 29 (90.6%) had severe head injury, and three (9.4%) had moderate head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with mild head injury suffered post-traumatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of post-traumatic vasospasm began on the fifth day and lasted 1 to 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 8 (25%) patients, post-traumatic vasospasm began within the first three days of the head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 32 patients with post-traumatic vasospasm, 10 (31.2%) patients had mild vasospasm, 20 (65.5%) had moderate vasospasm, and 2 (6.3%) had severe post-traumatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical deterioration was documented in two (2.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Development of post-traumatic vasospasm correlated only with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on initial computed tomographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was an increased incidence of post-traumatic vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score on admission was inversely related to the development of post-traumatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the period of vasospasm was short and clinical deterioration was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Probably, two varieties of post-traumatic vasospasm exist, one that lasts a shorter time and does not correlate with the presence of SAH, and a second that correlates with the presence of SAH, lasts longer, and resembles aneurysmal vasospasm </plain></SENT>
