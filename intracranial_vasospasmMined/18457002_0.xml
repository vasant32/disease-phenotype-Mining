<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular responses to variations in blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> are attenuated during delayed vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is routinely used to assess the presence of vasospasm, but cerebral blood flow velocities (CBF-V) measured by TCD do not necessarily reflect cerebral blood flow (CBF) or the severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the correlation of end-tidal pCO2 levels with CBF-V and CBF is equally decreased in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during variations in pCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to the vasospasm group and eight animals to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals in the vasospasm group underwent placement of an autologous subarachnoid blood clot and vasospasm was confirmed by angiography on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, CBF and CBF-V were measured simultaneously while end-tidal pCO2 was altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured using a thermal probe placed on the cortical surface and CBF-V was measured using a commercial TCD device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pearson's correlation coefficient between CBF-V values and pCO2 levels in the control group was strong (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.001) while it was moderate in the vasospasm group (r = 0.54, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation of CBF values with pCO2 in healthy controls was equally strong (r = 0.87, p = 0.005), while there was no correlation in the vasospasm group (r = -0.09, p = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, correlations of CBF-V with pCO2 values during chemoregulation testing were lower in animals with vasospasm than in healthy ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This correlation coefficient based on modifications in pCO2 may potentially facilitate the non-invasive assessment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
