<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the effectiveness of continous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> infusion for vasospasm prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six adults (mean age 54.6 years; 71% women; 92% Caucasian) were included in this comparative matched-cohort study of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on the basis of computed tomography (CT) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients who received continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> infusion were matched for age, race, sex, treatment option, Fisher grade, and Hunt and Hess grade to 38 historical control individuals who did not receive MgSO4infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve grams of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> in 500 ml <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was given intravenously daily for 12 days if the patient presented within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was diagnosed on the basis of digital substraction angiography, CT angiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and evidence of neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was present at a significantly lower frequency in patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> infusion (18%) compared with patients who did not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> (42%) (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> infusion may have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
