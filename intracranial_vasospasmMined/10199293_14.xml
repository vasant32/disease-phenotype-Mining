<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) dilates constricted arteries at the circle of Willis to reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although 90% of the patients show angiographic improvement after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, only 70% show clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Why some patients do not improve after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a 48-year-old woman who failed to improve after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rerupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathologic studies were performed to determine why <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> failed to reverse the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The arteries of the brain were studied by light microscopy using Gomori's trichrome stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arteries were also studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The arteries that were dilated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> showed compression of the connective tissue, stretching of the internal elastic lamina, and a combination of compression and stretching of the smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The small arteries and arterioles that had been treated with an infusion of intraarterial papaverine were constricted with a thickened intimal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in small and perforating arteries may contribute to the failure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> to reverse after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
