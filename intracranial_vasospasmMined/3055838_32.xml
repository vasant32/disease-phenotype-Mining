<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared flow velocity in these vessels with findings from 56 cerebral angiographies obtained in 51 patients at from day 1 to day 21 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the proximal segment of the middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, and posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, ACA, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, respectively) were measured from anteroposterior films produced in one angiographic laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients investigated on day 1-2, the median <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameter was 2.8 mm with range 2.3-3.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median flow velocity was 56 cm/s, range 36-88 cm/s (within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a clear inverse relationship between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameter and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 13 MCA's having diameter 1.5 mm or less showed flow velocity in excess of 140 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This seems a useful limit to diagnose pronounced <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm (50% diameter reduction) with this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further clues to the severity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> spasm were obtained from the ratio calculated dividing the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity by the flow velocity in the ipsilateral, extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), since spasm probably does not involve the neck vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This ratio was from 1.1 to 2.3, median 1.7 at day 1-2, but rose to over 10 in patients with the most severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lumen narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> flow velocity was inversely related to the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment of ACA spasm requires considering findings from both hemispheres combined, since the two proximal ACA's usually anastomose through the anterior communicating artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
