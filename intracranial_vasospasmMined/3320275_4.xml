<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A control group of 21 patients and a second group of 20 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and a group of 26 with other intracranial pathologies were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Doppler flow velocity (DFV) was significantly higher when vasospasm was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If it was higher than 100 cm/s, the patients were found to have vasospasm in 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If Doppler flow velocity was below 100, less than 10% had spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler flow velocity was not found to increase following craniotomy in patients not suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients there was a trend to increased Doppler flow velocity especially in patients who developed neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doppler flow velocity and Initial Slope Index by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> clearance (ISI) were not found to correlate with clinical grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ISI/DFV quotient (which can be shown mathematically to be related to vessel diameter) was found to correlate well with clinical grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this largely post-operative group, absolute levels, or rate of change of Doppler flow velocity could not be shown to be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or existence of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
