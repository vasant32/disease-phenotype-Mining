<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has been postulated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SAH and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of CuZn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (CuZn-SOD) on the induction of iNOS after SAH was examined by using transgenic mice overexpressing CuZn-SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SOD-transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates were subjected to SAH by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the left anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression after SAH was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the distribution of iNOS-positive cells was immunohistochemically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nuclear expression of activated nuclear factor-kappaB, a major transcription factor of iNOS gene, was also immunohistochemically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nontransgenic mice, SAH-induced iNOS protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in the arteries of basal cistern as well as in the cerebral cortex were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH-induced iNOS protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in those tissues were much reduced in SOD-transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the nuclear expression of the activated form of nuclear factor-kappaB was immunohistochemically detected in the cerebral cortices of nontransgenic mice but not in those of SOD-transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that oxygen-derived free radicals, particularly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, play an important role in the iNOS gene expression after SAH and provide a molecular basis for the protective role of SOD against vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
