<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For vasodilation, a "cocktail" consisting of 10(-4) M papaverine, 2 x 10(-4) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, and 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was administered intra-arterially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two rabbits were divided into six groups: control (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals); control plus cocktail (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals perfused with the cocktail before fixation); SAH (animals sacrificed 48 hours subsequent to intracisternal injection of 1.5 ml/kg of arterial blood); SAH plus cocktail (SAH plus perfusion with the cocktail); BaCl2 (animals sacrificed 10 minutes after intracisternal injection of 2 ml of 3 x 10(-3) M BaCl2); and BaCl2 plus cocktail (BaCl2 animals perfused with the cocktail) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar arteries in the control and the control plus cocktail groups was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BaCl2 reduced the diameter 44% and SAH reduced the diameter 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the diameter of the BaCl2 plus cocktail group and SAH plus cocktail group when compared with the control or the control plus cocktail group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination by light and transmission electron microscopy showed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing and corrugation of the elastic lamina with few degenerative or proliferative changes of the vessel wall in animals with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is caused initially by smooth muscle contraction rather than by proliferative vasculopathy and that it is not an irreversible process </plain></SENT>
