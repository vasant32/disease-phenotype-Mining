<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Maxadilan is a vasodilatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> isolated from the blood-feeding sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its vasodilatory activity, estimated by the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> on rabbit skin, is greater than those of calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PACAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that maxadilan is a specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> for the PACAP type I receptor, which is widely distributed in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were interested in the vasodilatory effect of maxadilan on cerebral arteries and the possibility of its clinical use for the delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following subarachnoid (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, 10(-10) mol/kg of maxadilan (in <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> water) was injected into the cisterna magna three days after the induction of experimental SAH in rabbits (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maxadilan dilated spastic basilar arteries within 30 min of the injection, but not at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, to prolong the vasodilatory effect of maxadilan, tablets containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi>, hydrogenated oil, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi>, hydroxypropylcellulose and 15 mg of maxadilan were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro testing showed that 60% of maxadilan could be released slowly within the initial five days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo experiments were performed to implant the maxadilan tablet (n = 7) and the placebo tablet (n = 6) into the cisterna magna after the induction of experimental SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spastic response of the basilar artery was maximum on day three in the placebo-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we observed no significant change in the arterial diameter until day five in the rabbits treated with maxadilan tablet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that maxadilan may have therapeutic potency in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
