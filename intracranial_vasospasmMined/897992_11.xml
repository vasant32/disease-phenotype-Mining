<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following this treatment the artery became three to five times more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> compared with vessels from untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was reflected in a parallel shift of the log dose-response curve towards lower concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in a way resembling that seen after cocaine treatment of sympathectomy and interpreted as a prejunctional supersensitivity of the vascular alpha-receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The injection of blood also increased the amount of vasoconstriction with 5-hydroxytryptamine to a level which was three times higher than that obtained in untreated vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest one type of mechanism whereby <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> might be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
