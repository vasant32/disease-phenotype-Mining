<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review enumerates the many proposed mechanisms of vasospasm, including cellular elements, agents derived from the blood and injured cerebral tissues, alteration of calcium: <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> ratios, free radical reactions, hypothalamic injury, clogging of the subarachnoid space, obstructions of the vasa vasorum and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the media with subintimal proliferation and intraluminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, no single agent has been demonstrated as the only source of vasospasm, and whether the disorder is spasm or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> remains the subject of argument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factors influencing the frequency, timing, severity and distribution of angiographically documented vasospasm are discussed, including data from our own population-based study over a 3 year period showing an incidence of vasospasm of 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis is given to the observation that differences in patient populations play a major role in the incidence and severity of reported vasospasm: those from non-selective populations show a higher incidence of vasospasm and a greater severity of the syndromes attributed to spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypotheses are offered to account for the low frequency of vasospasm in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical syndromes of vasospasm are reviewed, with special emphasis on our own material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and subsequent course of syndromes include those of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> consistent with embolism, and those of gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> suggesting a low flow state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their relationship to the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the vasospasm is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The paucity of syndromes of isolated deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the lacunar type is noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An account is given of the many failed therapies and the future hopes for early surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Innovations in medical therapy, including the use of some platelet inhibitors available only in some countries, and rationales for the use of aspirin and even <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is discussed </plain></SENT>
