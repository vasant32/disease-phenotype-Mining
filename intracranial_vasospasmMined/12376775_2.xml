<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbit models of vasospasm have been developed as in vivo experimental pathogenesis and the treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> using human vessels are not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> following induced SAH in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Ten rabbits' left leg veins catheterised by intravascular access needle and 3F catheters introduced to the right leg arteries probing the proximal of the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially IV-DSA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three millilitres of fresh autologous arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna of the ten rabbits' in order to produce in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were obtained 15 minutes and 72 hours after the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Diameters of the basilar arteries were similar to each other in both methods and reduced after the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interpretation:The present study shows that IV-DSA is a relatively simple and effective method for demonstrating cerebral vessels, especially the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
