<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen adult mongrel dogs were divided into two groups, two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH group (n = 8) and control group (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contents of 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> in CSF, the basilar artery segment, and subarachnoid clot were measured by enzyme immunoassay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi> content on Day 7 in the SAH group was 67.9+/-29.9 pg ml(-1) (n = 8), which was significantly higher than 27.1+/-13.8 (n = 8) on Day 0 in the SAH group, and 33.2+/-14.4 pg ml(-1) (n = 5) on Day 7 in the control group </plain></SENT>
