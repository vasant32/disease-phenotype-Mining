<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document the influence of the treatment modality (early surgery versus early endovascular treatment) on measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a nonrandomized series of 156 patients treated within 72 hours of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The following parameters were prospectively collected in a computerized data base and retrospectively analyzed for association with vasospasm-related ischemic infarctions: 1) Hunt and Hess (H&amp;H) grade, 2) Fisher grade, 3) highest mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFVMAX) and maximum percent change in mean CBFV (%deltaCBFV) as recorded by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, 4) incidence of repeat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 5) incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits, 6) incidence of delayed ischemic infarctions, and 7) Glasgow Outcome Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one patients (26.3%) suffered ischemic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic infarction rate was correlated with higher H&amp;H grade (P = 0.002), higher Fisher grade (P = 0.05), higher CBFVMAX (P &lt; 0.001) and %deltaCBFV (P = 0.01), occurrence of repeat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits, and endovascular treatment (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The infarction rate was higher with endovascular treatment versus surgery (37.7 versus 21.6%), as a result of a skewed Fisher Grade 4 infarction pattern in the endovascular treatment group versus the surgery treatment group (66.7 versus 24.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suspect that unremoved subarachnoid/intracerebral clots contributed to the higher infarction rate with endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients with Fisher Grade 4 and H&amp;H Grade V were excluded from analysis, the difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> incidence between the treatment groups no longer reached statistical significance (Fisher Grades 1-3, P = 0.49; H&amp;H Grades I-IV, P = 0.96) </plain></SENT>
