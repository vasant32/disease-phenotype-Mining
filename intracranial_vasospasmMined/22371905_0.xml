<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CVS model was established by injection of fresh autologous nonheparinized arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the timecourse of the MMP-9 expression in the basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, we chose the maximum time point of vasospasm (Day 3) and assessed the effect of SB-3CT (a selective MMP- 9 inhibitor) on the regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured by H&amp;E staining and the MMP-9 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elevated expression of MMP-9 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and peaked on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal administration of SB-3CT, the vasospasm was markedly attenuated after blood injection on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that MMP-9 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this rat experimental model of SAH and that the administration of the specific MMP-9 inhibitor could prevent or reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
