<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the techniques and efficacy of intracranial intraarterial papaverine infusion for symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Papaverine was infused on 19 occasions in 14 patients, 6 hours to 2 days after spasm became apparent clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty vascular territories were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion was made into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery 20 times, cavernous internal carotid artery once, selective A1 anterior cerebral artery 8 times, M1 middle cerebral artery 7 times, and basilar artery 3 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Papaverine doses ranged from 150 to 600 mg and exceeded 400 mg on 8 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic improvement occurred in 18 (95%) of the 19 treatment sessions: results were excellent in 3 sessions, moderate in 8, and mild in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best angiographic results often were obtained with superselective infusion, although angiographic results did not always correlate with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven (50%) of the 14 treated patients showed dramatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical improvement within 24 hours of papaverine therapy, and there was no clinical evidence of recurrent vasospasm in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of angiographic vasoconstriction was demonstrated in three patients; one showed marked clinical improvement after a second treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> developed in one patient because of papaverine infusion near the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Papaverine was effective in dilating narrowed arteries in most patients with symptomatic vasospasm caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This series showed encouraging clinical results with no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> in those patients who responded well to papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Superselective infusion appears to be indicated in some cases for adequate papaverine delivery </plain></SENT>
