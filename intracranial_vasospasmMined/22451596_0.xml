<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is a common and potentially life-threatening complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of vasospasm may include intraarterial (IA) injections of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> into the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical experience suggests that the average patient experiences an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reduction in systemic blood pressure after IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study objective was to (1) identify the effects of IA injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and (2) determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> dose on change in MAP and HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that (1) selective IA injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is associated with a reduction in MAP and an increase in HR and (2) the change in MAP and HR are linearly related to the dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied subjects with vasospasm scheduled for cerebral angiography with possible IA injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were given a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Invasive arterial blood pressure and HR were monitored continuously and recorded at 10-second intervals throughout the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified the lowest MAP and highest HR before and after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and change in MAP and HR was determined using repeated-measures multivariate regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounding factors (weight, preoperative vasopressor use, and preinjection MAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data are reported as adjusted coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 20 subjects who underwent a total of 46 injections of IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our multivariate model, on average, each 5 mg of IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was associated with a 3.5 mm Hg reduction in MAP (95% CI -5.0 to -2.0, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HR was not significantly altered by IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> on both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (nonsignificant increase of 0.4 beats per minute for each 5 mg of IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, 95% CI -1.6 to 2.4, P = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under general anesthesia, injection of IA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> into cerebral arteries reduces MAP but does not change HR in the average patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to determine the clinical significance of these results </plain></SENT>
