<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ring preparations from control vessels or vessels removed three or seven days after injection of blood, were contracted with either 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and then exposed to increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries, low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> enhanced the response to PGF2 alpha, while higher concentrations caused relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> were inhibited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries were compared with arteries from animals injected with blood, in the case of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> was a less effective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> at low doses, but equieffective at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments conducted with PGF2 alpha showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> was a more effective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in spastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha have significant differences in the mechanism by which they produce contraction of cerebral vessels, that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> has secondary effects on contraction independent of inhibition of calmodulin, and, finally that the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> in clinical vasospasm may be insufficient to reverse the condition, despite the observation that vessels in spasm may be more sensitive to this agent </plain></SENT>
