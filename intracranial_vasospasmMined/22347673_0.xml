<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor like sildenafil acts as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of oral sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> in patients with symptomatic refractory vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 832 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid bleed were operated in 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and seventy-three patients had vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 72 patients had refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was defined as refractory when institution of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHH</z:e>" failed to reverse the transcranial Doppler (TCD) values even after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan showed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and the serum electrolytes were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They received 100-150 mg of sildenafil every 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response was evaluated by 2-hourly TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients had sustained (TCD values <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for &gt;48 hours) and four had temporary relief in vasospasm, as suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed complications significant enough to terminate the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> may be effective in patients with refractory symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It calls upon the pharmacologists and scientists to discover newer supraselective PDE inhibitors, specific to PDE receptors in brain vessels </plain></SENT>
