<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The system has detected and measured clinically significant disease in the carotid siphon and bifurcation, even in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiograms, and has recorded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and disappearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may act as a flexible Helmholtz resonator, possibly being driven by vortex shed or turbulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal is the development of a safe, non-invasive method by which the physician could investigate warning symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in order to recommend preventive surgery or medical treatment early before the patient's condition might deteriorate </plain></SENT>
