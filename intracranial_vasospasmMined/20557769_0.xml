<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic methods are available for the detection and treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This includes transcranial Doppler, CT or MRI perfusion scan, protein S100B dosage, cerebral blood flow monitoring at the bedside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment of vasospasm relies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497247,C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">increased blood pressure</z:e> and dobutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergency balloon angioplasty or arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> infusion is mandatory in case of vasospam- induced ischemic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite several medical advances in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, particularly interventional neuroradiology, it remains a potentially devastating illness with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important determinant of outcome is neurologic state on arrival in the hospital, assessed with the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale (table 1) (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and medical complications due to SAH have both a major impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> study, including 457 patients with SAH, showed that the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from medical complications (23%) was comparable with the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to the direct effects of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (19%), rebleeding (22%), and vasospasm (23%) after aneurysmal rupture (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of ICU management is to prevent or to limit the consequences of vasospasm and to treat medical complications that can have an adverse effect on the brain </plain></SENT>
