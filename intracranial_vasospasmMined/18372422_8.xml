<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficacy of intra-arterial administration of nimodipine (IAN) in patients with severe vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains unproved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate the clinical effect and cerebral perfusion after IAN in patients with severe vasospasm refractory to hemodynamic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six of 214 patients with aneurysmal SAH were included in the prospective study, approved by the local ethics committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met the criteria of medically refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was monitored angiographically by digital subtraction angiography and by transcranial Doppler (TCD), perfusion CT (PCT), and neurologic examination during treatment course and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No angiographic effect was observed in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled PCT values revealed a reduction of time to peak (P = .03) and mean transit time (P = .17) 1 day after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect did not persist during the following days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled TCD analysis demonstrated a transient increase in flow 1 day after intervention (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No trend was evident during the next 7 days after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional infarction was experienced by 61.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAN in a selective patient group resulted in a positive response with reduction of angiographic vasospasm and increase in cerebral perfusion as detected by PCT after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IAN appears more effective than intra-arterial papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless the efficacy of IAN is temporary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the search for more effective treatment strategies to reduce critical vasospasm and to improve cerebral perfusion must be continued </plain></SENT>
