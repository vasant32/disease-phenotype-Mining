<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the possible involvement of MAPK in hemolysate-induced signal transduction and contraction in rabbit basilar artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isometric tension was used to record the contractile response of rabbit BA to hemolysate, and Western blots were obtained using antibodies for MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following results are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) Hemolysate produced a concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit BA; however, preincubation of arteries with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 markedly reduced this contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 also relaxed, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the sustained contraction induced by 10% hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2) The Janus tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor AG-490, preincubated with arterial rings, reduced the contractile response to hemolysate but failed to relax the sustained contraction induced by this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Src-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> damnacanthal and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> failed to reduce hemolysate-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3) Hemolysate produced a time-dependent elevation of MAPK immunoreactivity as seen on Western blots of rabbit BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MAPK was enhanced 1 minute after hemolysate exposure and the effect reached maximum levels at 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of MAPK decayed slowly over time, but the level of this kinase was still higher than the basal level, even at 2 hours after exposure to hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of arteries with the MEK inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 abolished the effect of hemolysate on MAPK immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemolysate produced contraction of rabbit BA, possibly by activation of MAPK, and therefore MAPK inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
