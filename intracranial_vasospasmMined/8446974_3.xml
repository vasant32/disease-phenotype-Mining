<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier reports showed elevated or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelin levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in patients suffering from SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether endothelin is a causal factor in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of these 11 patients had a proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and six had experienced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Big endothelin levels were determined by a radioimmunoassay recognizing the C-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, 1-11 fmol/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no elevations of big endothelin in the 59 plasma samples and the 17 simultaneously estimated cerebrospinal fluid samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid did not reach significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Big endothelin values between patients with and without vasospasm showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that plasma elevation of the endothelins is not reproducible in SAH and that big endothelin is unlikely to be a causal plasma factor in the complex multifactorial development of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
