<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be a correlation between the severity of vasospasm and the magnitude of pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large myofibroblast cells and type V collagen within the medial layer were abundant in arteries showing marked vasospasm, but were less conspicuous in those showing milder involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries from patients who died from non-cerebral causes did not demonstrate these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ruptured vessels, there was also a positive fluorescence for actin-myosin filaments in layers of the arterial wall other than the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the intimal and adventitial actin-myosin, myofibroblasts and type V collagen may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by holding the damaged vessel in a contracted phase during the healing period </plain></SENT>
