<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on microthrombi formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and explore its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 24 adult male SD rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) control group (n = 6); (2) SAH group (n = 6); (3) SAH + vehicle group (n = 6) and (4) SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 ml of fresh arterial, non-heparinized blood into prechiasmatic cistern in 20 sec with a syringe pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was administered ip at a dose of 20 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain samples were excised after perfusion fixation at 7 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microclots were evaluated by H&amp;E staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microthrombi formation was measured by fibrinogen immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of microthrombi was 1 ± 1, 25 ± 5, 24 ± 4 and 5 ± 2 in control, SAH, vehicle and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of microthrombi significantly increased in cerebral cortex at 7 days post-SAH (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> down-regulated the formation of microclots in the SAH model and the number of microthrombi decreased significantly in the SAH + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group as compared with the SAH or SAH + vehicle groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> alleviates microthrombosis in late phase of SAH in this prechiasmatic blood injection model </plain></SENT>
