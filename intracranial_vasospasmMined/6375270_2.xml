<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximum fall in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) after administering of 2 micrograms/ kgBW and 15 micrograms/ kgBW of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>, ranged from 35 to 45 mmHg and from 65 to 85 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drop in MABP after an injection of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (1.5 mg/ kgBW ) was between 30 and 40 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If MABP did not fall, the vessel diameter did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although papaverine elicited marked dilation of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and spastic basilar arteries, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> did not dilate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar arteries and produced only a slight dilation of spastic basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was simulated by an intracisternal injection of fresh autologous arterial blood 3 days prior to experimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured by the heat clearance method, before and after an intravenous administration of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> or papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in rCBF fell into 3 categories: Type A, no change; Type B, a change which varied with the arterial blood pressure, and Type C, an increase rCBF despite systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type A or B was observed in 17 out of 19 cats with SAH in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> was administered intravenously, and Type C was observed in only 2 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen untreated control cats produced a Type A or B response in 12, and Type C response in only one cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the control and SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29792">hydroperoxy</z:chebi>-5, 8, 11, 13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24644">HPETE</z:chebi>) was infused, the same results prevailed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> increased rCBF either transiently or continuously in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> dilates extracranial rather than intracranial vessels regardless of the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
