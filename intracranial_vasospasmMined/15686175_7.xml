<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy consecutive patients underwent direct surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping within 48 hours of SAH and had computed tomography (CT) findings classified as Fisher group III or IV with densities of more than 65 Hounsfield units (HU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis of the cisternal clots was performed during surgery using 1.6 mg tPA in 55 cases or 3.2 mg tPA in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If postoperative CT within 24 hours of surgery showed areas with density more than 65 HU, additional tPA (0.8 mg/day) was administered into the cisternal catheter until the high density areas disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cisternal drainage catheters were left in place until day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional tPA injection was necessary in four of the 55 patients receiving 1.6 mg tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in three patients (4.3%) and two patients had low density areas on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent deficit (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remained in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative cisternal irrigation with tPA combined with cisternal drainage is safe and effective for the prevention of symptomatic vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
