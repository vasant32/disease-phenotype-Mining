<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the therapeutic benefits of intra-arterially administered papaverine for treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in microcatheter technology have facilitated endovascular approaches to vessels experiencing vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, despite numerous encouraging anecdotal reports, no rigorous examination of the efficacy of these procedures has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial infusion of papaverine has become part of the standard management of vasospasm at some centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined a series of 31 patients undergoing papaverine infusion for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were a subgroup of the series enrolled in the North American Trial of Tirilizad for Aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These individuals were matched with patients from the same trial who exhibited similar clinical characteristics (including the degree of vasospasm and the modified Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores measured at the time of admission and on the day of papaverine infusion) but received medical management alone for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis comparing these two groups showed no statistical difference in the 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale scores between patients receiving papaverine and control subjects (58% favorable outcomes for control subjects versus 45% for patients receiving papaverine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although isolated series documenting clinical successes have prompted the increased use of papaverine as a treatment for vasospasm after SAH, this series suggests that, as it is currently being used, the drug does not provide added benefits, compared with medical treatment of vasospasm alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result does not preclude the possibility that alterations in the timing of or indications for drug treatment might produce beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
