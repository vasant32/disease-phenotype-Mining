<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, 2ME2 has been shown to downregulate <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the major cerebral arteries might activate a unique signaling pathway, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), to produce or enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 70) were randomly divided into 5 groups: Sham operated, SAH without treatment, SAH treated with vehicle (DMSO), SAH treated with two HIF-1alpha inhibitors, 2ME2, and D609 (positive control of 2ME2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH model was produced by middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2ME2 and D609 were administered intraperitoneal at 1 h after SAH; rats were sacrificed after 48 h of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thick blood clot was observed around basilar artery under arachnoids in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals except Sham group; severe morphological vasospasm was observed in basilar arteries in SAH and SAH+DMSO rats, and the mild vasospasm in rats treated with 2ME2 and D609; 2ME2 and D609 reduced the activity of HIF-1alpha in the basilar arteries by HIF-1alpha DuoSet ELISA; reduce the expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNIP3 and PCNA in basilar arteries by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, it decreased the mortality and improved the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 2ME2 is a powerful agent to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by inhibiting HIF-1alpha activity and the expression of VEGF as its downstream, suppressing endothelium and VSMCs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via BNIP3 pathway, and attenuating vasoproliferation </plain></SENT>
