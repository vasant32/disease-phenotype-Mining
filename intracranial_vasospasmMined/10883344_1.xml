<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine is a class Ib drug that is widely used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound is mainly known as a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker, but studies have demonstrated that it can also activate ATP-sensitive K+ channels and block <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent in vitro data from experiments on liposomes indicate that mexiletine is also a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unique activity profile of this drug raised the possibility that it might be of benefit in limiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our first series of experiments assessed the effects of mexiletine on transclivally exposed rabbit basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arteries were treated with 50-mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, 20-nM endothelin-1 (ET-1), or 100-microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52288">lysophosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi>) in the presence or absence of 400-mM mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, ET-1, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> was inhibited by mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced in rabbits by injecting 3-ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after SAH induction, transclivally exposed basilar arteries exhibited a spastic constriction that was partially reversed by topical application of 400-microM mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a third set of experiments, mexiletine was administered orally at dosages of 80-, 20, and 5-mg/kg/day t.i.d., beginning 3 hours before SAH to study the prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a separate group of animals, 80- and 20-mg/kg/day t.i.d. of mexiletine was administered 21 hours post-SAH induction, to study the reversal of vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analysis of vessels from controls (no SAH), SAH-only, and SAH + mexiletine groups indicated there was 71.43% vascular constriction in the SAH-only group compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considerable vasorelaxation was seen in the prevention study, in which average arterial cross-sectional areas were reduced by only 17.86% and 39.29% in the mexiletine 80- and 20-mg/kg/day groups, respectively, compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, average arterial cross-sectional areas were reduced by 53.58% and 64.29% in the mexiletine 80- and 20-mg/kg/day reversal groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that mexiletine induces potent relaxation in cerebrovascular arteries contracted with various agents, and that it prevents and partially reverses SAH-induced vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
