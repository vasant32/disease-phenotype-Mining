<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several investigations suggest a key role of endothelin (ET) in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebrovasculature, physiologically ET-dependent constriction is mediated by the ET(A) receptor, whereas activation of the endothelial ET(B) receptor results in relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, existence of a contractile ET(B) receptor was postulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), according to gene expression studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation is, therefore, to characterize the function and the expression of the ET(B) receptor in the cerebrovasculature during CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CVS was induced in the rat double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model and assessed by perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed on Days 3 and 5 after SAH, and immunohistochemical staining for ET(B) receptors was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isometric force of basilar artery ring segments with (E+) and without (E-) endothelial function was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentration effect curves for the ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, sarafotoxin 6c, were constructed by cumulative application in segments under resting tension and after precontraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunoreactivity for the ET(B) receptor was observed exclusively in the endothelium and was not significantly altered after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under resting tension, sarafotoxin 6c did not induce significant contraction in E+ or E- segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After precontraction, a significant relaxation was induced by sarafotoxin 6c administration in sham-operated rats (mean maximum effect, 103 +/- 10%), which decreased time dependently after SAH (Day 3, 68 +/- 3%; Day 5, 42 +/- 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, however, was not significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present investigation provides evidence for the loss of the ET(B) receptor-mediated vasomotor function after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, antagonism of the ET(B) receptor may be undesirable for the treatment of CVS </plain></SENT>
