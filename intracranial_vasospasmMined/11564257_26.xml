<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite improvements in the care of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains a major cause of morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is now evidence that a decrease in the local availability of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) plays a role in delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a controlled-release polymer containing the NO donor (Z)-1-[2-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NO) for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> posthemorrhagic vasospasm in the rat femoral artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The release kinetics of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymers</z:chebi> loaded with 20% (w/w) DETA/NO were determined in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm was induced in the left femoral artery of adult male Fischer 344 rats (n = 35) by exposure to autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1, 3, or 7 days after blood exposure, either a 5-mg polymer loaded with 20% (w/w) DETA/NO or an empty 5-mg polymer was placed in the periadventitial space next to the left femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, an empty 5-mg polymer was placed next to the right femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the 8th day after blood exposure (at the peak of vasospasm in this model), rats were transcardially perfused with 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>, and the left and right femoral arteries were removed for histological processing and morphometric analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was expressed as the percent lumen patency of the treated left artery, compared with the control right artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in vitro release kinetics demonstrated that the 20% DETA/NO-loaded polymers released up to 15% of their total drug load during a 9-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DETA/NO treatments initiated at 1, 3, or 7 days after blood deposition <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly inhibited vasospasm, compared with control values (94.6 +/- 7.2% versus 67.6 +/- 5.8%, 104.6 +/- 5.5% versus 64.9 +/- 1.7%, and 102.4 +/- 5.1% versus 73.6 +/- 1.4%, respectively; mean +/- standard error of the mean percent lumen patency; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects of treatment were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diazeniumdiolate NO donor DETA/NO can be effectively released from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32028">vinyl acetate polymers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Administration of DETA/NO into the periadventitial space can prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> posthemorrhagic vasospasm in the rat femoral artery and can reverse established vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects of DETA/NO were observed in this model </plain></SENT>
