<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Because oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> appear to reduce the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), interest in their application intraarterially has emerged for cases in which noninvasive means of alleviating vasospasm are unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies to date have been limited to the administration of low intraarterial doses because of concerns about hemodynamic stability and changes in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These doses, although effective in cases of milder vasospasm, were inadequate in severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors present a series of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> who underwent 12 procedures in which they received &gt; or = 20 mg of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> per procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent endovascular treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> due to aneurysmal SAH by the senior author between February 2005 and October 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were identified who had undergone a total of 12 procedures during which &gt; or =20 mg of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> had been administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From angiography reports, anesthesia records, and nursing records, we obtained pre- and postverapamil mean arterial blood pressures (MABPs), heart rates, intracranial pressures (ICPs) (when available), and visible changes in the degree of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant changes in MABP, heart rate, or ICP were observed after administration of &gt; or = 20 mg of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, and the degree of improvement in vasospasm was statistically significant based on our grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the change in hemodynamic parameters and the total dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that high-dose intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> may be used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> without compromising hemodynamic stability or increasing ICP </plain></SENT>
