<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent publications suggest that a combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> and cisternal irrigation might reduce symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present clinical prospective randomized phase I/II study was initiated in order to analyze the prophylactic effect of intracisternal lysis in combination with kinetic treatment followed by intrathecal nimodipine lavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with aneurysmal SAH, WFNS grade 2 to 5 (GCS 13-3) and Fisher grade 3 or 4 were included in this prospective randomized study which had been approved by the local Ethics Research Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following insertion of a ventricular drain, securing of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by a microsurgical or endovascular route and the insertion of two lumbar catheters, intracisternal lysis with urokinase 120 000 IU/d was performed for 48 h in the patients of the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal pressure was monitored by the second lumbar catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal lysis, intrathecal nimodipine lavage was applied for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients kinetic head-rotation was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was clinically identified with a focus on delayed neurological deficits (DINDs) by daily transcranial Doppler (TCD), computerized tomography (CT), perfusion CT (pCT) and cerebral angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no DIND in the study group among the patients who were awake, while two DINDs occurred in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled TCD flow velocities over an average period of 14 d revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm-related infarction on CT was seen in two patients of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evident vasospasm on DSA appeared in three patients of the study group compared with 7 patients in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover there was a neurological improvement in the study population as measured by mRS at 3-month follow-up (P=0.266) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In two consecutive patients randomized to the study group a <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the lower extremities of unknown origin occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As a result of these complications the study was stopped in accordance with the local Ethics Research Committee guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A multimodal approach with translumbar lysis in combination with kinetic therapy followed by intrathecal nimodipine lavage proved to be effective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and for clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, due to the observed complications with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> in two patients of the study group the trial was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the promising preliminary results suggest a further development of the clinical protocol using a modified multimodal concept to prevent and treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after severe SAH </plain></SENT>
