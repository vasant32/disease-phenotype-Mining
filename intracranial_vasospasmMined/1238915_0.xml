<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>That direct intracranial operation in indicated in ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> which has passed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is an accepted procedure today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, regarding the pros and cons of direct intracranial operation during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, settlement has yet to be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This arises from the fact that various combined aggravated pathological states of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> etc. are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors had attended to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in the cases of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and conducted ventriculoatrial shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> actively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, it was found that ventriculoatrial shunt brought about considable improvement of the patients condition to such an extent that an early operation became possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are following: (1) The authors conducted cerebral angiography in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage in 51 cases of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of this 51 cases as a result of angiographic findings, 12 cases, 23.5% showed ventricular dilation and accompanied lowering of consciousness level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The largest number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> among our cases appeared in patients in the age level of 30-39, amounting to 44.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While this seemed to indicate the importance of the age factor, no correlation was seen with the localization of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> or the number of experienced ruptures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) Of 12 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> 7 cases were subjected to ventriculoatrial shunt operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 7 cases, after operation 6 cases showed an improvement in consciousness remarkably, thus making it possible to conduct an early intracranial operation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ventricular drainage, V-A shunt for the following reasons: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is very few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The site of burr hole for V-A shunt located in parietal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>So craniotomy area, for example bifrontal craniotomy is apart from the site of V-A shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The control of intracranial pressure is also easy after intracranial operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> can be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This method is useful for decreasing the brain bulk during the direct operation </plain></SENT>
