<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A deficit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> that persisted and was severe or caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by the end of the 21-day treatment period occurred in 8 of 60 patients given placebo and in 1 of 56 given nimodipine (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the amount of basal subarachnoid blood on pre-entry CAT scans in patients with deficits from spasm showed that an increase in subarachnoid blood was not associated with a worse neurologic outcome among patients who received nimodipine, unlike the situation in patients given a placebo </plain></SENT>
