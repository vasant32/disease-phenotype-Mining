<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was designed to compare two monitoring instruments: a standard neurological tool (SNR) and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two assessment tools were compared to evaluate their concordance and to identify areas where efficiency in recording assessments might be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no statistical difference between the two tools in detecting symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Substantial discrepancies in the documentation of observations were noted, particularly in the assessment of limb drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Avoidance of these discrepancies may require further definition in the SNR tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A qualitative component consisting of a review of the nurses' notes regarding neurological status in the patients' charts was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that nurses commonly document information in the progress notes that is already captured in the SNR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further education of nurses in the use of assessment tools is therefore recommended to avoid redundancies and increase efficiency in recording clinical observations </plain></SENT>
