<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of puerarin on the vascular active factors correlated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four patients with aSAH were randomly assigned to the puerarin group (30 cases) and the control group (24 cases) by lot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of routine treatment, the patients in the pueparin group were intravenously dripped with 0.5 g puerarin by adding in 250 mL <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injection once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The injection was given starting from the 3rd day of the disease course, for 14 successive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> B, (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>), 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1alpha</z:chebi> (6-K-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi>) were compared between the two groups pre- and post-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) was observed using transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) were compared at discharge between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the plasma levels of NO, ET-1, and 6-K-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1alpha</z:chebi> increased in the puerarin group (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>05), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> level decreased (P &lt; 0.05), the incidence of CVS decreased (P &lt; 0.05), the mean <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity increased (P &lt; 0.05), and the GOS at discharge increased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Puerarin is an effective agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of the CVS in patients after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it can improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism might be correlated with improving the levels of the vascular active factors, i.e., increasing the plasma levels of NO and PGl2, decreasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>, in plasma, increasing the cerebral blood flow, and improving cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
