<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six dogs were subjected to autologous non-heparinized blood injection via cisternal puncture twice at one-day interval to establish models of SAH, and another 6 received injections with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline in an identical manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1)H-MRS scan was performed on the 3rd, 7th and 14th days after the injections to measure the changes of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the (1)H-MRS scan, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dogs underwent brain digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for determining the basilar artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DSA results on day 3 presented development of obvious vasospasm of the basilar artery, which was most evident on day 7 and recovered obviously on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1)H-MRS results demonstrated obvious changes of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>, Cho and Cr on days 3 and 7 in SAH model group, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> declined to the lowest level on day 3 followed by gradual ascending till reaching the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cho decreased slightly on day 3, then increased and reached the peak level on day 7 and then decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cr rose steadily from day 3 to 14, but since day 7, the rise slowed down obviously and Cr maintain a level not significantly different from that on day 14 (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional results of (1)H-MRS were consistent with the DSA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1)H-MRS can be used to monitor the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> resulting from SAH as a good evaluation method for functional imaging </plain></SENT>
