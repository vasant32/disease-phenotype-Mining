<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with 148 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography was performed before and/or after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A near-infrared excitation light illuminated the operation field, ICG was injected intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intravenous fluorescence was imaged with a video camera integrated into the microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 208 investigations of ICG angiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping was applied in 120 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incomplete clipping was detected in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parent and/or branching <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was found in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed perfusion of ICG was detected in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in 108 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angiographic results were consistent with findings on intraoperative ICG angiograms in 100 patients (92.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three cases, a mild stenosis was seen on DSA, which was not detected intraoperatively using ICG angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one patient, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients had small residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> found by postoperative DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The remaining one developed a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICG angiography is a simple, reliable and cost-effective method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It provides real-time information in detecting the patency of parent, branching, perforating arteries and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This technique may be a useful adjunct to improve the quality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
