<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was evaluated in a prolonged experiment using dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the diameter of the basilar artery were followed by angiography, and morphological changes were studied by photomicroscopy and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, OKY-1581 (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-(E)-3-(4(-3-pyridylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)-2-methylacrylate) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dogs received intravenous injections of 160 mg of OKY-1581 dissolved in 2 ml of physiological saline immediately after subarachnoid blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the animals received continuous intravenous infusion of the drug at the rate of 4 gm/50 ml/24 hours until sacrifice 4 days after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control dogs received subarachnoid blood injection without treatment with OKY-1581 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic examination revealed that the late spasm was almost completely abolished by the treatment with OKY-1581 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early spasm was also prevented, but the drug's effect was less prominent than it was on the late spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphological study revealed degenerative changes in the endothelium and myonecrotic changes in the tunica media following SAH in the basilar arteries of the treated as well as the untreated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was almost completely absent in the treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The above results indicate that a disproportionate synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> plays an important role in the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH, and that drugs such as OKY-1581 that selectively inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase might be useful in the prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
