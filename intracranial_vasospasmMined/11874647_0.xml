<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on the characteristic radiological signs and criteria for diffuse axonal injury (DAI), 89 patients with the diagnosis of DAI were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nimodipine proved to be safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With TCD sonography we found that there was a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this series (38.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, Nimodipine produced a better clinical result than placebo, but there was no statistically significant difference in favorable outcome at 3 months after injury (P=0.11) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A trend toward a favorable effect was suggested by the analyses in two small subgroups, either in the patients suffering from clinical Grade III DAI (P=0.04), or in those with the TCD-evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during clinical observation (P=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that a clinically valuable benefit is possible with nimodipine treatment in DAI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the effects on outcome should be verified by further controlled study </plain></SENT>
