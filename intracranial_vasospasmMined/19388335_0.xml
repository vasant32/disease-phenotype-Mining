<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken in 30 patients who were status-post clipping of a ruptured anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ICP monitoring, post-operative <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/A1 flow velocity measurements, and post-operative angiography were evaluated, with clinical follow up for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical testing was done using a Chi- square analysis between ICP &gt; = 30 mmHg, CPP &lt; = 70 mmHg, TCCD-A VSP and DND and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Mean ICP was 34.2 mmHg and mean CPP was 71.3 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICP &gt; = 30 mmHg occurred in 56.7%. of patients and CPP &lt; = 70 mmHg occurred in 36.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCCD-A VSP, DND and poor outcome occurred in 56.7%, 60% and 33% of patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall ICP &gt; = 30 mmHg was significantly related to TCCD-A VSP (p value = 0.046) but not with DND or poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CPP &lt; = 70 mmHg had no significant relationship with TCCD-A VSP, DND or poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCCD-A VSP was significantly related to DND (p value = 0.00018) but not to poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of TCCD-A VSP and ICP &gt; = 30 mmHg was significantly related to poor outcome (p value = 0.015), but the combination of TCCD-A VSP with CPP &lt; = 70 mmHg was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased ICP, not decreased CPP, was related to VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of TCCD-A VSP and increased ICP was predictive of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ASAH should include reduction of increased ICP especially when there is concomitant TCCD-A VSP </plain></SENT>
