<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has long been suspected that, due to its potent vasoactivity, erythrocyte lysate provides the major vasoconstrictive input to cerebral arteries during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the model conditions (incubation at 37 degrees C in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid), however, the rate of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> was quite slow (about 1%/day), becoming only somewhat more rapid after 4 days' incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of aging erythrocytes was dramatically increased (500- to 1000-fold) by the addition of plasma proteins, but only after the erythrocytes had aged 2 to 3 days, or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of age-dependent, plasma-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> of originally autologous erythrocytes is shown to involve activation of the plasma complement protein pathway, analogous to the mechanisms of innate immunity which lead to lysis of nonautologous cell types and activate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
