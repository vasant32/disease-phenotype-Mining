<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the potential function of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi>, which occur naturally in plasma and serum, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S1P), to act as proinflammatory mediators in cerebral artery vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rat cerebral arteries, SPC but not S1P activated p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using transcription factor arrays, two proinflammatory transcription factors activated by SPC in cerebral arteries were identified--nuclear factor-ÎºB and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both these transcription factors were activated by SPC in a p38MAPK-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp>, an inflammatory protein array was performed, which showed that SPC increased release of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) in cultured rat VSM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression was confirmed in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The S1P did not increase <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that SPC, but not S1P, can act as a proinflammatory mediator in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> observed after SAH and may be part of the initiating event in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
