<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a clot group (8) and a sham-operated group (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals underwent craniectomy, and in the clot group, the autologous blood clot was located around the arteries dissected free from the arachnoid membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 7 days after (Day 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, regional CBF in the parietal lobe--measured by the hydrogen clearance method--and central conduction time were studied during either graded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the clot group, the mean vessel caliber of the cerebral arteries on the right side (clot side) of the circle of Willis showed significant (P less than 0.01) reduction (more than 40%) as compared with the values on the contralateral, non-clot side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The values for the bilateral parietal CBF in the sham-operated group and the left parietal CBF in the clot group were fairly constant when the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was in the range of 60 to 160 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the clot group, right parietal CBF was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that on the left side at an MABP level of 40 to 100 mm Hg, and increased at an MABP level of 180 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right parietal CBF increased as the arterial blood pressure increased, showing impairment of autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
