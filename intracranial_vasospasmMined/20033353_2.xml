<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For endovascular treatment of vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH), an intraarterial treatment course with the calcium channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> nimodipine infused for 30 min is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As some patients still show ongoing vasospasm thereafter, we report on our experience with an extended time period of selective intraarterial nimodipine administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In nine patients with aSAH and refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we left the catheter in place within the internal carotid artery after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the neurosurgical ICU, a continuous infusion of intraarterial nimodipine was commenced, combined with intraarterial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy was controlled with extended neuromonitoring techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients died from refractory vasospasm and a fourth suffered lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients survived in a good clinical condition, two of them without apparent neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of intraarterial nimodipine was best verified with regional CBF monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD failed to detect vasospasm in two patients and missed improvement in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue oxygenation increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but was not indicative of vasospasm in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion reflected the treatment course adequately in the qualitative scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective continuous intraarterial nimodipine treatment for refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aSAH seems feasible and may add to the endovascular therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Appropriate monitoring technology is essential for further investigation of this novel technique </plain></SENT>
