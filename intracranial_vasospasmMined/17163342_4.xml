<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been used as the standard method for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multislice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a relatively recent method used for evaluating the vasculature of the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare multislice CTA and DSA for the detection and quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, and to analyze the usefulness of multislice CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with SAH underwent initial CTA with DSA within 72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and follow-up multislice CTA and DSA 8 to 48 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five arterial locations were established in the A1 and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery, the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) on both multislice CTA and DSA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was classified as none, mild (up to 30% reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter), moderate (31-60% reduction), and marked (at least 60% reduction) using the scale of Schneck and Kricheff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multislice CT system used the following parameters: 1.25 mm collimation and 3.75 pitch with a 4-channel system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm revealed by the multislice CTA was significantly correlated with the degree of vasospasm revealed by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, most discrepancies between CTA and DSA were in the detection of mild and moderate vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the consistency between multislice CTA and DSA was greater for mild (100%, n=3) or moderate (100%, n=3) vasospasm than none (n=1) or marked vasospasm (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it was unclear whether multislice CTA was more specific for a proximal location (A1, M1, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) or distal location (A2, M2) for evaluation of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multislice CTA can detect angiographic vasospasm after SAH with an accuracy similar to that of DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multislice CTA is highly sensitive, specific and accurate in detecting mild and moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is less accurate for detecting no vasospasm and marked vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors propose that multislice CTA be considered as a useful tool for the detection and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
