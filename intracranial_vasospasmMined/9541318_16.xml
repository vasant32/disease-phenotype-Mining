<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare a group of 19 patients treated with craniotomy and aneurysmal clipping with a group of 18 patients who were treated via endovascular occlusion with Guglielmi detachable coils in regard to frequency and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated within 48 hours of ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the endovascular group, nine patients had Hunt and Hess grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, five patients had grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and four patients had grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the Fisher classification, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was grade I, nine were grade II, and eight were grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were on the anterior circulation and seven were on the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the surgical group, 10 patients had Hunt and Hess grade I <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, seven had grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and two had grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of these were Fisher grade II and 10 were grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were on the anterior circulation and one was on the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascularly treated patients were medically treated identically to those in the surgical group, with prophylactic volume expansion and hemodilution immediately after endovascular occlusion, except that they also received 48 hours of full heparinization followed by 24 hours of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> infusion after endovascular occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients in the endovascular group in whom delayed neurologic deficits developed as a result of vasospasm responded to elevation of blood pressure and did not require either mechanical or chemical angioplasty to reverse their symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the surgical group, 14 of 19 developed clinical vasospasm, with elevation of their transcranial Doppler velocities, and required maximum triple-H (hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients required mechanical and pharmacologic angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No surgical complications were incurred as a direct result of the craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient in the endovascular group developed a femoral pseudoaneurysm as a complication of the procedure and postocclusion anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were noted in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with similar Hunt and Hess grades and Fisher grades, preliminary data suggest that the frequency and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be reduced in those treated by endovascular occlusion of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as compared with those treated by direct surgical clipping </plain></SENT>
