<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurs only in surface vessels or also in parenchymal arterioles is debatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to evaluate comprehensively the microvasculature of the brainstem after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine mongrel dogs of either sex, each weighing between 18 and 24 kg, underwent double blood injections spaced 48 hours apart; the injections were infused into the cisterna magna immediately after angiography of the basilar arteries (BAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three additional dogs assigned to a control group received no blood injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dogs were killed on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial sections obtained from the midpontine region of both control dogs and animals subjected to SAH were evaluated with respect to the morphological characteristics of vessels and neurons, and for ultrastructural changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm occurred in the BAs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs subjected to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in these animals, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas and vessel perimeter in parenchymal arterioles, but not in parenchymal venules, were observed to have increased when compared with those of control dogs (p &lt; 0.01, t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was observed and smooth-muscle and endothelial cells remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the ultrastructural level in the dogs with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this model, vasospasm of the BAs did not extend into the region of the pons to affect the intraparenchymal arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dilation of the parenchymal arterioles might serve as compensation for reduced blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, no neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or infarction resulted in the pontine region of the brain </plain></SENT>
