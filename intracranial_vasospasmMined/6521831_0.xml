<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We, neurosurgeons have sometimes confronted with the case of posttraumatic cerebrovascular narrowing or spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few reports on the pathophysiology of the posttraumatic narrowing or spasm in comparison with those the spasm following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by the rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report here a case of temporal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> who demonstrated cerebrovascular narrowing angiographically at the 21st days after head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This 53-years-old male was examined again by angiography one week after the above-described angiography and the narrowing disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed the literature on the posttraumatic cerebrovascular narrowing or spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty seven cases have been reported in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions of these 38 cases including the present case, the pathophysiology of the posttraumatic cerebrovascular narrowing or spasm was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two theories had been suggested for a long time: one was vasospasm caused by the traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the other by direct mechanical irritation of cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, neurogenic factor is thought to take a part of this to a great extent such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751230,C0348470,C0869047" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothalamic dysfunction</z:e> or dysfunctioning fragile autoregulation mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is seemed to be that such spasm caused by these mechanism will exist sure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in the posttraumatic cerebrovascular vasospasm, there are other accompanying intracranial lesions such as cerebral swelling, cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>, fracture of the base of the skull and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is not assumed to be so simple environment as the spasm following the rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and also the mechanism of genesis of the posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> is not to be so simple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several factors and their duplication will play a role in the mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is necessary for the clearness of the problem </plain></SENT>
