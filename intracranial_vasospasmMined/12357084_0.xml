<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether the lack of a diastolic notch within the TCD waveform was associated with relative hyperemia within 5 days after injury in 35 traumatic brain injured (TBI) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperemia (avD<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27140">(O2)</z:chebi> of &lt; 4 ml/dL) was present in 16 patients and absent in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two clinicians independently coded TCD waveforms based on the presence of a diastolic notch (88% agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the presence of a diastolic notch by group; a diastolic notch was present in 57% (11/19) of patients without hyperemia and 81% (13/16) of patients with hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of detecting hyperemia using the diastolic notch was 18.7% and 57.9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that relative hyperemia was present without an elevation in blood flow velocities, and that the lack of a diastolic notch did not detect the presence of hyperemia in the TBI patient </plain></SENT>
