<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the mechanical properties of canine basilar arteries subjected to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle contractility was determined from pressure-diameter curves obtained after subjecting the basilar arteries to three different conditions: Krebs-Ringer solution (KRS), Krebs-Ringer solution containing <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>), and saline solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pressure-diameter curves obtained in KRS and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> are biphasic and have sharp flexions that yield flexion points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pressure level at the flexion point increases as vasospasm increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong constriction is retained up to that pressure above which the constriction is released abruptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that increasing the intraluminal pressure dilates the spastic artery nonlinearly and that induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could relieve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by vasospasm if blood pressure were maintained above the flexion point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The contractile response of spastic arterial wall to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> remains unchanged after SAH although the spastic constriction increases progressively and becomes maximal seven days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesser the arterial wall stiffness, the more efficiently it constricts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This means that the diminution of arterial stiffness observed after SAH might be one of the factors promoting the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
