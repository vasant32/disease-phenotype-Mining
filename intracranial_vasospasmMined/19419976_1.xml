<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV), a narrowing of the cerebral vasculature, significantly contributes to the poor recovery profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variation in the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase (eNOS) gene has been implicated in CV and outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this project was to explore the potential association between three eNOS tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and recovery from SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included 195 participants with a diagnosis of SAH and DNA and 6-month outcome data available but without preexisting neurologic disease/deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and TaqMan assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CV was verified by cerebral angiogram independently read by a neurosurgeon on 118 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scores (MRS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were collected 6 months posthemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square analysis as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sample was primarily female (n=147; 75.4%) and White (n=178; 91.3%) with a mean age of 54.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the participants with CV data, 56 (47.5%) developed CV within 14 days of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the SNPs individually were associated with CV presence; however, a combination of the three variant SNPs was significantly associated with CV (p=.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one SNP (rs1799983, variant allele) was associated with worse 6-month GOS scores (p&lt;.001) and MRS (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the eNOS gene plays a role in the response to SAH, which may be explained by an influence on CV </plain></SENT>
