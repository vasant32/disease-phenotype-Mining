<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many therapeutic interventions have been proposed to treat this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; however, the most effective means to counteract this development still eludes the health care team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faced with this dilemma, recent investigators have examined subarachnoid blood as visualized on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies have enabled them to identify those patients most at risk for developing symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predicting the occurrence as well as the severity and location of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> will facilitate early implementation of preventative measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This knowledge may help to minimize the frequent unfavorable outcomes following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the subsequent development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroscience nurse can apply this information to the clinical setting by being able to identify those patients at high risk for developing symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, to improve assessment skills, and to plan and anticipate the patient's future needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A case study is offered to illustrate how this is accomplished </plain></SENT>
