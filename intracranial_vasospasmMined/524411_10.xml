<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small cored vesicles were transformed, decreased and disappeared gradually after development of vasospasm induced by blood-CSF mixture incubated 5--10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes were not induced by fresh arterial blood, lysed platelets in saline and mechanical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the portion with severe vasospasm induced by incubated blood-CSF mixture, nerve distribution was rich and uniform in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> portions of the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the portion with slight vasospasm, nerves were extremely scanty in the innermost area of the adventitia, within 10 mu from the outer edge of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of experimental vasospasm became definitely lighter and the duration shorter after bilateral cervical sympathectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that nerves, especially the adrenergic axon in the innermost area of the adventitia, may play an important role on the genesis of late vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in nerve distribution may be a factor influencing individual differences in frequency or severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
