<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SAH in rabbits was simulated by a single injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna, and, for 7 days, the caliber of each basilar artery was examined several times via angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 SAH rabbits, the peak of the arterial narrowing was observed on Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this model, the effect of intravenous administrations of FUT-175 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven SAH rabbits were randomly divided into three groups, and 3 doses of 1, 2, or 3 mg of FUT-175 were administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic arterial narrowing on Day 2 in nontreated SAH rabbits (Control) was 35% compared with 21, 5, and 14% in rabbits treated with a total of 3 (Group A; n = 9), 6 (Group B; n = 13), and 9 mg (Group C; n = 5) of FUT-175, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant differences in the arterial calibers between Group A and the Control on Days 1 and 2, between Group B and the Control from days 1 to 4, and between Group C and the Control from days 1 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three other rabbits, after vasospasm reached its maximum on Day 2, no vasodilatory effect was observed when a total of 6 mg of FUT-175 was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the inhibition of the plasma serine protease cascades at an early stage of SAH prevents the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
