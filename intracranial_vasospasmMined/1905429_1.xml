<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that blood placed on the adventitial surface of cerebral arteries enhances intimal platelet accumulation, positively correlating with endothelial damage and other pathologic changes in vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the ability of a single bolus injection of tissue plasminogen activator to prevent platelet accumulation in cerebral vessels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was produced in cats by the transorbital intracisternal injection of 2.5 ml autologous arterial blood around the proximal part of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 animals, 25 micrograms tissue plasminogen activator was injected at intervals of 10 (five cats) and 60 minutes (five cats) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal physiological saline (0.5 ml) was injected in six cats 10 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelets labeled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111 were injected intravenously just before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and their radioactivity was measured in cerebral arteries at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, early injection of tissue plasminogen activator inhibited intimal platelet accumulation, but later injection did not, although the extent of subarachnoid clot was reduced at both plasminogen injection times </plain></SENT>
