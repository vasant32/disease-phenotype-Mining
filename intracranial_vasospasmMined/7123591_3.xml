<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular specimens were resected transclivally as cylindrical segments and their external diameters were measured in vitro in the pressure range from 0 mm Hg to 250 mm Hg in the active condition of smooth muscle in Krebs-Ringer solution and in the passive condition in saline solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was confirmed comparing the diameter difference between these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental data indicated that vasospasm was most prominent on the 7th day after the treatment of blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the passive condition no significant dimensional change (i.e. radius and wall thickness) was observed between the control and the treated arteries at various pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results imply that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing under vasospasm is not attributable to an irreversible organic change in the wall but to the constriction of vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treated arteries are more distensible and have lower elastic moduli than the control arteries, possibly due to a change in the content of their connective tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes of the passive elastic properties of arterial walls after blood injection might be one of the factors affecting the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
