<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> is being increasingly used as a hypnotic drug in neuroanaesthesia and for sedation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is evidence of a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> effect on voltage-dependent calcium channels; hence, the administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> may interact with the haemodynamic effects of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the haemodynamic interactions of both compounds in chronically instrumented dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented for measurement of heart rate (HR), left atrial (LAP), aortic (ABP), and left ventricular pressure (LVP), LV dP/dt, cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV), and myocardial wall-thickening fraction (WTF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After complete recovery from surgery and assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting blood gas values and temperature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals received on separate days either <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> 30 mg/kg.h (P), nimodipine in two maintenance doses in the awake state (N), or the combination of nimodipine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (N+P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maintenance doses of nimodipine in N and N+P were 1 and 2 micrograms/kg.min for 40 min each after a bolus of either 10 or 20 micrograms/kg min over 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed as controls, in the middle (20 min), and at the end (40 min) of each maintenance infusion of nimodipine or at equivalent points in time in group P (Fig. 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> were mechanically ventilated after endotracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood gas values were kept within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were analysed with repeated measures of ANOVA followed by student's t-test with Bonferroni correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference for any of the measured parameters between N and N+P or between the two maintenance doses of nimodipine (Table 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HR was significantly higher with both doses of nimodipine in the awake state compared to the control values (123 +/- 7.1 and 146 +/- 6.4 vs 78 +/- 2.4/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The administration of nimodipine with and without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> led to a significant increase in CBFV (Fig. 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in CBFV between nimodipine in the awake state and in combination with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (Fig. 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> does not alter the systemic haemodynamic and regional myocardial effects of a nimodipine infusion in a dose of 1 or 2 micrograms/kg.min in chronically instrumented dogs </plain></SENT>
