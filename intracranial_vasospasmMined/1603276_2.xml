<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report 15 cases of peripheral PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were discovered after their rupture and two were discovered after rupture of concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, and one was detected incidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As to the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, more than half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose at the telovelotonsillar segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on the same peripheral PICA, which were not obvious on preoperative angiography because the ruptured one was partially thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another rare case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located at the internal auditory meatus is also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of CT were characteristic, namely <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the fourth ventricle without obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the basal cisterns, or only within the cerebellar vermian cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon strongly suggested the possibility of rupture of peripheral PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As to the surgical results, 10 patients (71%) of the 14 patients had a good recovery, and 1 patient (7%) with nonrupture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had a fair result due to pre-existing pontine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (21%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding occurred in 3 patients, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurred in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, as peripheral PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are likely to be missed, and rebleeding is an unfavorable factor, one should try to demonstrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with angiography, by using various methods such as subtraction or magnification </plain></SENT>
