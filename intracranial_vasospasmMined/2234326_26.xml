<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new animal model for vasospasm using rat femoral artery has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whole blood, washed erythrocytes, or leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma were selectively applied to the adventitial surface of the femoral artery for 7 days in 15 rats, after which the vessels were perfusion-fixed and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared with matched control arteries, there was a prominent reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional area after 7 days in vessels exposed to whole blood or washed erythrocytes, but not in those exposed to leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In arteries with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing, light and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated marked morphological changes throughout the vessel wall similar to those seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry disclosed a prominent loss of immunoreactive actin in smooth muscle cells of arteries exposed to whole blood or erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the time course of arterial narrowing in this model, whole blood was selectively applied to the adventitial surface of femoral arteries in 23 rats for periods from 2 to 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared with control arteries, arterial narrowing was variably present at 2 days, progressively increased by 5 days, was maximal at 7 to 10 days, and returned to near control levels by 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence and severity of ultrastructural changes in vessel wall corresponded to the degree of arterial narrowing over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> narrowing in rat femoral artery exposed to periadventitial blood is analogous to that observed in cerebral arterial vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This new model represents a simple and reliable means to investigate pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapies for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
