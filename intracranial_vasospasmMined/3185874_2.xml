<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arteries were precontracted by extraluminally administrated 0.67 X 10(-4) M 5-hydroxytryptamine or 10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxyHb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between these groups in the dose-response curves of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>)-induced relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of oxyHb used was enough to abolish the endothelium-dependent relaxation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> when administered intraluminally in this preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blocking effect of oxyHb to endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) did not appear for at least 3 hours after the extraluminal application of 10(-5) M oxyHb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the inactivation of EDRF by oxyHb may not play an important role in producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the initial stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
