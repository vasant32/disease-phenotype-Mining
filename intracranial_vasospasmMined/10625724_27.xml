<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the availability of these therapies improves outcomes at these institutions has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed institutional factors in the outcomes of patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in the academic medical centers of the University Health Systems Consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (primary outcome), length of stay, and hospital charges were evaluated in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, admission source, and admission status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2623 unruptured and 9534 ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> cases treated at 70 centers in the University Health Systems Consortium hospital discharge database during 1994-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated at institutions that more frequently used coil embolization were less likely to die in the hospital (relative risks [RRs] for every 10% of endovascular-treated cases: ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96; P=0.001; unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.91; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients treated at institutions that used angioplasty for vasospasm had a 16% reduction in risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with patients treated at other institutions (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospital treatment volume was not independently associated with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> at institutions offering endovascular services have lower rates of in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether this is due to improved outcomes with endovascular therapy or is a marker for other aspects of multidisciplinary care cannot be answered in this analysis </plain></SENT>
