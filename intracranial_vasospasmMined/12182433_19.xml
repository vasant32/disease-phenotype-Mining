<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records for 387 patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> who were treated at a single institution (University of California, Los Angeles) between May 1, 1993, and March 31, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and underwent cerebral arteriographic, transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies before and after endovascular therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> (vasospasm) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five patients fulfilled the aforementioned criteria and were treated with either papaverine infusion, papaverine infusion with angioplasty, or angioplasty alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After balloon angioplasty (12 patients), CBF increased from 27.8 +/- 2.8 ml/100 g/min to 28.4 +/- 3.0 ml/100 g/min (P = 0.87); the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was 1 57.6 +/- 9.4 cm/s and decreased to 76.3 +/- 9.3 cm/s (P &lt; 0.05), with a mean increase in cerebral artery diameters of 24.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Papaverine infusion (20 patients) transiently increased the CBF from 27.5 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g/min to 38.7 +/- 2.8 ml/100 g/min (P &lt; 0.05) and decreased the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity from 109.9 +/- 9.1 cm/s to 82.8 +/- 8.6 cm/s (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a mean increase in vessel diameters of 30.1% after papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment (13 patients) significantly increased the CBF from 33.3 +/- 3.2 ml/100 g/min to 41.7 +/- 2.8 ml/100 g/min (P&lt; 0.05) and decreased the transcranial Doppler velocities from 148.9 +/- 12.7 cm/s to 111.4 +/- 10.6 cm/s (P &lt; 0.05), with a mean increase in vessel diameters of 42.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon angioplasty increased proximal vessel diameters, whereas papaverine treatment effectively dilated distal cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our small series, we observed no correlation between early clinical improvement or clinical outcomes and any of our quantitative or physiological data (CBF, transcranial Doppler velocities, or vessel diameters) </plain></SENT>
