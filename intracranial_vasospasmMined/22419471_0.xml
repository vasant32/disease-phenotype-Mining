<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with ruptured vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were managed by various treatment modalities according to their conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by proximal vertebral artery coiling, 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and parent artery coiling, and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by stent-assisted coiling (4 of 5 by stent-within-a-stent technique), one by single double-stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bloody cerebrospinal fluid was drained by postoperative lumbar subarachnoid drainage in order to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 cases were successful without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication during the operation.There was 1 case of early postoperative non-aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 2 cases of posterial group <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsies</z:hpo>, 1 case harbored Hunt &amp; Hess IV who gave up treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After follow-up for 3-18 months, there was no rebleeding and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients recovered well, except 1 having posterial group <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases were followed up by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients treated by stent-assisted coiling, DSA showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> disappeared and loading vessel passed freely.DSA of 11 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and parent artery coiling demonstrated complete obliteration of the dissection without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early endovascular treatment of ruptured vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The selective method of endovascular management according to the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Double stent-assisted coiling should be the first choice </plain></SENT>
