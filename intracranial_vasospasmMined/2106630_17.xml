<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty monkeys were randomly assigned into one of five equal groups: a control group that underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> alone, and 0-, 24-, 48-, and 72-hour treatment groups that received 0.75 mg of tissue plasminogen activator at those times after baseline cerebral angiography and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven days later angiography was repeated and the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One animal in the 72-hour group developed a delayed ischemic deficit on Day 7 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control and 72-hour groups significant vasospasm occurred in most of the major, right cerebral arteries (P less than 0.05), but no significant vasospasm developed in the 0-, 24-, and 48-hour groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a large subarachnoid clot remained in the control animals, most clot had been dissolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lysing of subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with intrathecal tissue plasminogen activator within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is effective in preventing vasospasm in primates </plain></SENT>
