<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients admitted after suffering closed head injuries, with Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores ranging from 3 to 15, were evaluated with transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity was determined in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because proximal flow in the extracranial ICA declines in velocity when arterial narrowing becomes hemodynamically significant, the extracranial ICA velocity was concurrently monitored in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess cerebral perfusion, cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements obtained with the intravenous 133Xe technique were completed in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm, designated as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity exceeding 120 cm/sec, was found in eight patients (26.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm, defined as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity greater than 200 cm/sec, occurred in three patients, and was confirmed by angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was documented by computerized tomography in five (62.5%) of the eight patients with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of severe vasospasm were associated with subarachnoid blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time course of vasospasm in patients with traumatic SAH was similar to that found in patients with aneurysmal SAH; in contrast, arterial spasm not associated with SAH demonstrated an uncharacteristically short duration (mean 1.25 days), suggesting that this may be a different type of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was identified between the lowest CBF and highest <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity in patients during the period of vasospasm, indicating that arterial narrowing can lead to impaired CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain damage was found in one patient who had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the territories supplied by the arteries affected by spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> is a frequent complication of closed head injury and that the severity of spasm is, in some cases, comparable to that seen in aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This experience suggests that vasospasm is an important secondary posttraumatic insult that is potentially treatable </plain></SENT>
