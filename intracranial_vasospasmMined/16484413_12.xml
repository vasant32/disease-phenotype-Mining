<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at multidetector-row spiral CT angiography (MDCTA) compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> (SAHs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients suspected of having vasospasm on clinical findings underwent both postoperative MDCTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MDCTA was analyzed by using volume-rendered images as well as axial images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 251 arterial segments were analyzed for vasospasm by using a 5-point grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MDCTA results were then compared with findings on the corresponding DSA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MDCTA for detection of hemodynamically significant spasms were also calculated, with findings at DSA used as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On DSA, 74 spasmatic segments were found among the 251 segments evaluated, and 40 segments with hemodynamically significant vasospasms were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall agreement between MDCTA and DSA was 95.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We had 12 (4.8%) cases of disagreement between MDCTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 segments, the degree of stenosis was overestimated at MDCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of MDCTA in the detection of hemodynamically significant vasospasm were 97.5%, 98.1%, and 98.0%, respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 90.7% and 99.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MDCTA appears to be a reliable alternative imaging technique to DSA in the assessment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
