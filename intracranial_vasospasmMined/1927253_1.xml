<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm of the basilar artery is induced photochemically after transpalatal illumination of intracisternally injected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> in two different rat strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Singlet oxygen, generated in the subarachnoid space, elicits vasospasm which has been demonstrated angiographically at 90 min and 24 h after photosensitisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague Dawley rats responded better than Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dilution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> in water was more vasospastic than dilution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> in artificial CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the action of singlet oxygen is similar to that of free radicals, this experiment gives an argument for the hypothesis that free radicals play a leading role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
