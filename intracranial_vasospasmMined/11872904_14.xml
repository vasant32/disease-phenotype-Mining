<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether recombinant endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene expression may protect vasomotor function and prevent vasospasm in a canine experimental SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recombinant adenoviral vectors (5x10(9) plaque-forming units/animal) encoding genes for eNOS (AdeNOS) and beta-galactosidase (AdLacZ) or vehicle were injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of dogs on day -1 (ie, 24 hours before the first intra-CSF injection of blood on day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed at day 0 (baseline) and day 7 (immediately before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), and tissues were harvested for additional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Western analysis and immunohistochemistry detected recombinant eNOS exclusively in cerebral arteries isolated from AdeNOS-transduced dogs, and in this group of animals CSF NO concentrations were significantly elevated by day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of day 7 versus day 0 cerebral angiograms for each group revealed significant spasm at the basilar artery midpoint in AdLacZ-transduced and nontransduced dogs but not in AdeNOS-transduced dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isometric force recording of basilar arteries isolated from AdeNOS-transduced dogs showed significantly augmented relaxations to bradykinin and reduced contractions to endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that expression of recombinant eNOS in the adventitia of cerebral arteries may contribute toward protection against post-SAH vasospasm </plain></SENT>
