<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TA-0201 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited ET-1-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated canine basilar artery without endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its pA2 value was 9.2 (ET(A) antagonism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a canine double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, intravenous treatment with TA-0201 (3 mg/kg, twice a day for 7 days) ameliorated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e> significantly on day 7 compared with that in nontreated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reductions of the basilar artery diameter were 26.1+/-3.9% and 40.5+/-4.1% with and without TA-0201 treatment, respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic study on day 7 indicated that treatment with TA-0201 inhibited vessel-wall damage such as disintegration of endothelium architecture and degeneration of medial smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intravenous treatment with TA-0201 prevents the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and accompanying pathologic changes of the vessel wall, probably through blockade of ET(A) receptors </plain></SENT>
