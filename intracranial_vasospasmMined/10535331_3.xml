<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier reports have provided evidence suggesting a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> blockade with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> on blood pressure and survival in animals following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, induced in conscious rats by injecting homologous blood via a catheter placed along the surface of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We combined measurements of plasma renin activity with blood pressure recording in order to examine renin-angiotensin system activation following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following subarachnoid injury an approximately three-fold increase in plasma renin activity occurred (3.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 10.1 +/- 1.8 ng angiotensin I produced/ml/h, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) prior to the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> blood pressure fell dramatically following the cerebral injury (124 +/- 5 vs. 94 +/- 7 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001), whereas blood pressure remained unchanged in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was markedly reduced in those animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the pronounced decrease in blood pressure and impaired survival following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> in animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, it would appear that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> activation of the renin-angiotensin system following this insult is in fact a desirable, compensatory response </plain></SENT>
