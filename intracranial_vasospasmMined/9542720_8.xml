<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alacepril or enalapril was used as an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> with or without a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> moiety in the structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH rats or sham-operated rats were produced by the injection of homologous blood or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the cisternal magna, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SAH rat, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was observed at 24 h after blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>)-induced relaxation in basilar arteries from SAH rats significantly decreased compared to that from sham-operated rats, although the relaxation induced by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> or papaverine did not decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the endothelium cell function of basilar arteries in SAH rats is damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alacepril prevented both the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the suppression in the <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>-induced relaxation of basilar artery in SAH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, enalapril did not prevent the suppression of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>-induced relaxation in SAH rats, despite the tendency to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that the preventive effect of alacepril on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> could be based on its protective effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation system </plain></SENT>
