<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between the biological protective mechanisms of scavengers and free radicals that are elicited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the pathogenesis of prolonged vasospasm following ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 25 patients treated by early surgery (within 72 hours after SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> concentrations and the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-px) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> increased significantly more (p less than 0.05) during the first 4 days after SAH in patients with symptomatic vasospasm than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic vasospasm had a marked decrease in SOD activity on Days 3 and 4 followed by a gradual decrease, whereas the patients without spasm showed little change (difference between the groups, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in catalase activity reversal to SOD activity, but no difference in GSH-px activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, correlation was close between the increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> concentration and the decrease in SOD activity in CSF (p less than 0.05), suggesting an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
