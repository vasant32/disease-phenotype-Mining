<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lipoxygenase activity in the subarachnoid clot and the basilar artery was measured, ex vivo, using samples obtained 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a quantitative analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi>, each sample was homogenized with either ice-cold saline or <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extract was then submitted to reverse-phase HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identity of each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> was further confirmed using straight-phase HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the basilar artery was homogenized with ice-cold saline, a significant increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28209">5-HETE</z:chebi> content was observed on SAH day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the artery was homogenized with <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi> were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of incubation in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, the 5-lipoxygenase activity was remarkably increased in the basilar artery exposed to SAH, compared to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subarachnoid clot contained a significant amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19138">12-HETE</z:chebi> (average 1.8 nmol/g wet weight) from day 2 to day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of 1,2-bis(nicotinamido)<z:chebi fb="46" ids="32879">propane</z:chebi> significantly ameliorated vasospasm in the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, simultaneously inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase activity of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observations show that the activities of 12- and 5-lipoxygenases are significantly increased after SAH in the subarachnoid clot and the basilar artery, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
