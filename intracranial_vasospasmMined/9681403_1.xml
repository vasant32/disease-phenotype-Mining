<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the study was limited in that DCLHb was given to animals with an intact vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As extravasated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, DCLHb in the subarachnoid space might in theory have a detrimental effect on cerebral perfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, autologous blood was administered into the cistema magna of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes, the animals received one of the following in the cistema magna (n=8 for each group): The control group received mock cerebral spinal fluid, the "blood" group received autologous blood, the "DCLHb" group received DCLHb, and the "Alb" group received human serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 20 minutes, areas of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF, 0-20 and 21-40 ml/100 g/min) were assessed in five coronal brain sections with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were evaluated by analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas of 0-20 ml/100 g/min CBF were greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five brain sections in the Blood group than in the other three groups; were greater in four brain sections in the DCLHb group than in the Control group; and were greater in three brain sections in the Alb group than in the Control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The areas of 21-40 ml/100 g/min CBF were greater in three sections in the Blood group than in the other three groups; and were greater in two brain sections in the DCLHb group than in the Alb group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support a hypothesis that subarachnoid blood induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and that although molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> decreases CBF, the potential adverse effects are less than those produced by blood </plain></SENT>
