<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping were included into this single center, randomized, double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received NPRIs implanted into the basal cisterns in direct contact to the exposed proximal blood vessels; in 16 control patients, the basal cisterns were opened and washed out only without leaving implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed preoperatively and at day 8+/-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography imaging was analyzed for the incidence of territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> unrelated to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of angiographic vasospasm in proximal vessel segments was significantly reduced after implantation of NPRIs (73% control versus 7% NPRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences occurred also for the majority of distal vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans revealed a lower incidence of delayed ischemic lesions (47% control versus 14% NPRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NPRI group demonstrated more favorable modified Rankin and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> scales as well as a significantly lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (38% control versus 6% NPRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of NPRIs reduces the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and delayed ischemic deficits and improves clinical outcome after severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
