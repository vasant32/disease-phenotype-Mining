<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 18 SAH patients diagnosed with vasospasm, the cardiac index (CI) was analyzed continuously via the radial FloTrac system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time-course changes in hemodynamic variables following dobutamine infusion at each dose increment (3-24 microg/kg/min) for reversing vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) and infarction were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At therapeutic dobutamine doses (3-15 microg/kg/min), CI increased immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of each dose administration, which gradually fell to a level slightly higher than the baseline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases whose neurological findings were able to be examined, an improvement of DIND occurred during the phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However at high-dose (20-24 microg/kg/min), dobutamine depressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume which was compensated for by increasing the pulse rate, thus raising CI only slightly from the baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that step-up increase of dobutamine dosage is not always effective in raising CI in patients suffering from post-SAH vasospasm, but rather may cause some adverse effects associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption as evidenced by high-dose infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The less-invasive FloTrac system might be useful as a device for tracking trends in hemodynamic outcomes of hyperdynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
