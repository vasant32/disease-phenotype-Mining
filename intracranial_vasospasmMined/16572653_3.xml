<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients with vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH (12 men and 23 women with a mean age of 49.3 +/- 10.1 years) underwent imaging studies; thus, 35 perfusion CT scans and 35 SPECT images were available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values in 12 different brain regions were defined relative to the interhemispheric occipital cortex values using perfusion CT scans and were compared with qualitative relative (rel)CBF estimated on SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In brain regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mild (relCBF 71-85%), moderate (relCBF 50-70%), and severe (relCBF &lt; 50%) hypoperfusion on SPECT, the mean relCBF values measured on perfusion CT were 1.01 +/- 0.08, 0.82 +/- 0.22, 0.6 +/- 0.15, and 0.32 +/- 0.08, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001); the mean relMTT values were 1.04 +/- 0.14, 1.4 +/- 0.31, 2.16 +/- 0.46, and 3.3 +/- 0.54, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one brain region (30 regions) with severe hypoperfusion on SPECT images demonstrated relCBF values less than 0.6 and relMTT values greater than 2.5 on perfusion CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relative CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values on perfusion CT showed a high concordance rate with estimated relCBF on SPECT in patients with vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given its logistical advantages, perfusion CT may be a valuable method of assessing perfusion abnormality in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting of vasospasm and in patients with an unstable condition following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
