<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial infusion of 40 mg of papaverine containing 37 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO was performed from the C1 segment in seven of the nine patients and from the C4 segment in the other two patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 99mTc-HMPAO was distributed in the territories of the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the three patients who were treated with papaverine from the C1 segment at 2 ml/min, although most 99mTc-HMPAO was distributed in the territory of the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm of the ACA can be treated by intraarterial infusion of papaverine from the C1 segment at 1 ml/min when selective catheterization to the ACA is difficult to perform </plain></SENT>
