<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible role of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> ebselen in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we examined the effects of ebselen on the vasoactive mechanisms induced by endothelin (ET)-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and oxygen-derived radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated rabbit basilar arteries with intact endothelium were fixed in a perfusion system and perfused intraluminally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contraction of the artery was detected as an increase in perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ebselen, in a certain concentration range (3 x 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/L), significantly reduced the contractile response to ET-1 (10(-10) to 10(-8) mol/L) but not the contraction induced by 40 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It reduced the contraction induced by 10(-4) mol/L 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, a protein kinase C activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of 10(-5) mol/L dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent, partially reversed the inhibitory effects of ebselen on ET-1- and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ebselen (10(-5) mol/L) as well as a combination of catalase (1000 units/mL) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (150 units/mL) inhibited the potentiating effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (10(-5) mol/L) on ET-1-induced contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both ebselen and catalase inhibited the contractile response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> generated by ferrous ion (10(-3) mol/L) plus <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (10(-2) mol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ebselen reduced the response to <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> when a high dose (3 x 10(-5) mol/L) was applied and failed to preserve contractility of the preparation after exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ebselen suppressed ET-1-induced contraction and synergetic interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and ET-1, where free radical formation was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects may result from modification of the intracellular regulatory system including protein kinase C, as well as from protection against free radicals </plain></SENT>
