<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the standard of reference for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT angiography (CTA) is a relatively recent method for depicting the intracranial arterial vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare CTA and DSA in the detection and quantification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with SAH underwent initial CTA with or without DSA and follow-up CTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up CTA and DSA studies were performed within 24 hours of each other and 5 to 10 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum intensity projection images were produced for each CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six arterial locations were examined for spasm: the suprasellar internal carotid artery (ICA), the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery, the A1 and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery, and the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was categorized as none, mild (&lt;30% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> reduction), moderate (30% to 50% reduction), or severe (&gt;50% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall correlation between CTA and DSA was 0.757, but was better for proximal than distal locations (0.88-1.00 versus 0.152-0.446) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement between CTA and DSA was greater for no spasm (92%) and severe spasm (100%) than for mild (57%) or moderate (64%) spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CTA was highly accurate for no spasm or severe spasm in proximal locations (96%, and 100%, respectively); it was less accurate (90% and 95%, respectively) for mild or moderate spasm in these locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For distal locations, the accuracy for absent, mild, moderate, or severe spasm was 78%, 81%, 94%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA is highly sensitive, specific, and accurate in detecting no spasm or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in proximal arterial locations; it is less accurate for detecting mild and moderate spasm in distal locations </plain></SENT>
