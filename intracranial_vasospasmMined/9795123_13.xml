<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined the effects of the endothelin receptor subtype A <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, Ro 61-1790, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical neuronal injury and delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the cerebellum after mild traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered Ro 61-1790 or vehicle for 24 h after injury and euthanized at 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein70 (HSP70), a marker of neuronal stress/injury, was immunolocalized in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and enhanced immunoexpression of the complement C3bi receptor, both of which are indicators of cerebellar glial reactivity, and Purkinje cell loss were evaluated in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was maximal induction of HSP70 in cortical neurons at 24 h postinjury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drug treated animals showed significantly fewer HSP70 labeled cortical neurons at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were fewer reactive glia in the cerebellum of drug treated animals as compared to vehicle controls at 3 days postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, at 7 days postinjury glial reactivity and Purkinje cell loss were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that Ro 61-1790, when administered for the first 24 h postinjury, limits <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury in the cortex, transiently influences glial reactivity in the cerebellum, and does not attenuate delayed Purkinje cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter finding may reflect the duration of infusion of the drug </plain></SENT>
