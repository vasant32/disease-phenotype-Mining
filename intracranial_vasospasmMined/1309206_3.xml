<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Passaged cultures (10-30 passages) that expressed <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> receptors were studied using [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When tested in quiescent medium, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> potently stimulated [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation (EC50 of 31 nM) by as much as 400% at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of cells was not significantly increased at 24 or 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-5) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake was reduced 40-50% by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (1 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate a possible mechanism for the sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> currents were measured using the whole cell patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> currents was related exponentially to the membrane surface area, measured as cell capacitance </plain></SENT>
