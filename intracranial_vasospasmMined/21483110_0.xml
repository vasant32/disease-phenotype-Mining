<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of continuous intravertebral artery (cIVA) injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> on delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty white rabbits were alloted into groups: (i) seven-day (cIVA injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> for seven days after injection of blood) group, (ii) five-day (cIVA injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> for five days from the third day after injection of blood) group, (iii) intravenous treatment (intravenous infusion of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> after the first blood injection twice a day) group, and (iv) control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the rabbits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the four groups underwent selective vertebrobasilar angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological changes in the basal artery were observed by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> injection (2ml:30mg) was provided by Tianjin Chase Sun Pharmaceutical Company Limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe CVS occurred after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the control group, whereas, it was significantly lower after intravertebral artery and intravenous injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between the intravenous and intravertebral artery groups was statistically significant on the seventh day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effect of cIVA injection of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> in treating delayed CVS due to SAH at different time points was better than intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
