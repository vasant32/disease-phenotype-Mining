<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical evidence suggests that factors other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, such as delayed neuronal and astrocytic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, may play a role in the poor prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined this using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in 3 different brain areas in a dog model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using antibodies against neuronal marker neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in conjunction with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> marker (cleaved caspase-3), we quantified neurons and astrocytes to monitor the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH group showed 44 +/- 1% caspase-3 positive neurons in comparison to the 2.0 +/- 0.1% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001, 6 animals each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For astrocytes, a total 25 +/- 1% were caspase-3 positive in day 7 SAH group, as compared to 0.40 +/- 0.01% for controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional analysis revealed that neuronal caspase-3 immunoreactivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 regions were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) in SAH animals than that in the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the analysis of total area, size and signal co-localization of GFAP with caspase-3 indicated that astrocytic reactivity and proliferation are seen primarily in the hippocampal area, with the least changes detectable in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in the dog model, there was a significant increase of neuronal and astrocytic cleaved caspase-3, possibly reflecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, following SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes coupled with neurological deterioration seen in patients may present a possible reason for the poor outcome in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
