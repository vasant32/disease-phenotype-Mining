<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of papaverine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) by different routes of administration for the treatment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by autologous blood injected into the basilar and prepontine cistern was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> (2mg/kg) was injected either by an intravenous (IV), intra-arterial (IA), intra-cisternal (IC), or combination of intra-arterial and intra-cisternal (IA+IC) routes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery diameters were measured before and after vasospasm was induced and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction of vasospasm reduced basilar artery diameters by more than 50% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to artery diameters before vasospasm, diameters after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> treatment via the IV route were only reduced by 0.5+/-4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other reductions in the diameter included 29.1+/-10.4%, about 1.8+/-3.1%, and about 26.7+/-8.4% in the IA, IC, and IA+IC groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, IA administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> caused obvious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial application of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was the most effective way to treat vasospasm in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of IC route in our study did not confirm the results of prior study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possibility of side effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> via the IA route should be considered before clinical application </plain></SENT>
