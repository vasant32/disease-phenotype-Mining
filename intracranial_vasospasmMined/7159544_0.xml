<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Polygraphycal studies were carried out in order to evaluate the effects of Diltiazem (Ca-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) on cerebral circulation in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to these studies, the inhibitory effect of Diltiazem on incubated blood-, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced vasocontraction of basilar arteries was observed through on operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental vasospasm were induced by local administration of incubated blood and 10(-5)--10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The required dose of Diltiazem, 30-300 micrograms/kg, was injected by one shot intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF slightly decreased concomitantly with transiently decreased blood pressure shortly after intravenous injection of Diltiazem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After that, CBF increased for 15-20 minutes and returned to the state similar to that before the administration of Diltiazem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in reactive pattern of CBF depend on the doses of Diltiazem and related to changes of CAR and VAR which were thought to indicate the blood of cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasocontraction induced by incubated blood and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> was released 30-35 per cent for 30 minutes after intravenous injection of Diltiazem 100 micrograms/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, by administration of Diltiazem before and after local application of incubated blood and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> on basilar arteries, vasocontraction was inhibited completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that administration of Diltiazem (Ca-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) might be useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of vasospasm following rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
