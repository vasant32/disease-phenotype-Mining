<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Big ET-1 was the predominant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> present in the CSF of SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSF concentrations of big ET-1, ET-1, and ET-3 were significantly higher in older patients than in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SAH patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) documented by transcranial Doppler sonography and clinical signs, postoperative concentrations of ETs in the CSF remained at or were increased above levels measured before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SAH patients without CVS, the concentrations of ETs in the CSF decreased with time, whereas the time course of CVS coincided with the increase in concentrations of big ET-1 and ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The temporal dependence of concentrations of big ET-1 and ET-1 in SAH patients with and without CVS were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the basal cisterns as detected by computerized tomography was predictive of the concentrations of ETs in the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of ETs were not correlated with CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible role of ETs in the pathogenesis of CVS associated with SAH and the controversial data reported to date are discussed </plain></SENT>
