<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report compares the results of early and delayed operations for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in two groups of 100 consecutive patients managed at Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first group, operation was postponed for a minimum of 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and aneurysmal clipping was carried out only on patients classified as grade I or Ia in whom intracranial pressure was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and in whom serial angiograms demonstrated absence or resolution of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to this policy, 35 patients came to operation with no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0%) and four permanent neurological deficits (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients died prior to operation from a variety of causes including aneurysmal rebleeding, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and systemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 81 patients admitted in grades I-III, the survival rate was 43% (35/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second group, aneurysmal clipping was carried out as soon as possible after admission on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were grade III or below without specific regard to intracranial pressure or angiographic vasospasm, and on occasional grade IV and V patients with intracerebral clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this strategy, 81 of 86 grade I-III patients came to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 4 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4.9%), 10 permanent neurological deficits (12%), and a survival rate of 90% (77/86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Including three of six grade IV and V patients who were successfully operated upon for intracerebral clots, the overall survival of the second group (80%) was more than twice that of the first group (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that, whereas early surgical intervention for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> invites a higher operative mortality, patient mortality, by far the most important statistic, can be significantly reduced without increasing long-term morbidity </plain></SENT>
