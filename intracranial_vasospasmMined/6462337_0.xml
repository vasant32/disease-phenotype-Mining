<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A review of 45 cerebral vasospasm cases for cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> under computer tomography (CT) scanner and based on activities of daily living (ADL) resulted in the finding that, of 19 cases with vasospasm of "diffuse, severe" grade, 14 cases were rated "poor (disabled)" to "dead": CT-diagnosed cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was found in 4 out of 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From this, it was believed that indication for B-therapy was clinically significant vasospasm (diffuse, severe), which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> under the clinical grade of III or IV by Hunt and Kosnik without considering such incidental condition as severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After B-therapy, 45% showed ADL of at least "fair" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT-diagnosed cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was found in 4 out of 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None died from complications as a result of B-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The examination of ineffectual cases pointed to the importance of the first choice application of B-therapy, the continuation of the therapy as long as vasospasm continues, and the sustenance of cerebral perfusion pressure by the use of vasopressor (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi>) to offset the hypotensive effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With these points of care exercised, the B-therapy is believed to achieve good results </plain></SENT>
