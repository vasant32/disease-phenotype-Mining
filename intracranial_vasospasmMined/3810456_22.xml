<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experimental investigations have suggested an important role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this clinical study the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of the two main <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> are evaluated by measuring their stable degradation products 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> (6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) using radioimmunoassay methods during the pre- and postoperative course in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the serum levels of both substances do not seem to be important for the clinical course of the patients, the CSF concentrations of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> provide important data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A close correlation between the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> level of the individual patient and the amount of blood in the basal cisterns as detected by computed tomography scan can be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of this additional information for the occurrence of cerebral angiospasm is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the CSF levels of both metabolites the slight preoperative elevation of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> is significantly surmounted by an extraordinary rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, after cleavage of the basal cisterns there is a decline in the CSF levels of both substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pre- and postoperative clinical course in comparison to the CSF levels of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> is demonstrated in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> seems to be associated with an uneventful clinical course, whereas a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> level--whether occurring preoperatively or, even more important, as a secondary postoperative rise--seems to be associated with ischemic complications and neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that pre- and postoperative monitoring of CSF levels of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> may serve as a possible indicator for the detection of patients at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
