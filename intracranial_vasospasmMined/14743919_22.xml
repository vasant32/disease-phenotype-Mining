<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Interest has developed in the use of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg++) as a neuroprotectant and antivasospastic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> may increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduce the contraction of cerebral arteries caused by various stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors tested the hypothesis that a continuous intravenous infusion of Mg++ reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A dose-finding study was conducted in five monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to determine what doses of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> elevate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Mg++ to vasoactive levels and to determine what effects these doses have on the diameters of cerebral arteries, as shown angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a standard dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> had been selected it was then administered in a randomized, controlled, blinded study to 10 monkeys (five animals/group) with SAH, beginning on Day 0 and continuing for 7 days, at which time angiography was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 0.086-g/kg bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> followed by an infusion of 0.028 g/kg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> significantly elevated serum and CSF levels of Mg++ (five monkeys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> significantly elevated the serum level of total Mg++ from a control value of 0.83 +/- 0.04 mmol/L to 2.42 +/- 1.01 mmol/L on Day 7 and raised the CSF level from 1.3 +/- 0.04 mmol/L to 1.76 +/- 0.14 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no angiographic evidence of any effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the vasospasm in the middle cerebral artery was not significantly reduced (46 +/- 8% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>-treated group compared with 35 +/- 6% in the placebo [vehicle]-treated group, p &gt; 0.05, unpaired t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> did not significantly reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in the doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An investigation of SAH is warranted mainly to test whether a benefit can be achieved by neuroprotection or by augmentation of CBF by dilation of small vessels and/or collateral pathways </plain></SENT>
