<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of intracisternal nimodipine after induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five male Wistar rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control sham-operated group, the control <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-only group, and the treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 microL/hour of intracisternal nimodipine continuously for 5 days via subcutaneously implanted Alzet osmotic pumps (Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was analyzed 5 days later by means of digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination of the brain parenchyma was performed using Nissl-staining, c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end-labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detailed analysis of the digital subtraction angiography was possible for 31 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant angiographic vasospasm was induced in the double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>-only group compared with the sham-operated group (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 groups, there were statistically significant differences of the arterial vessel caliber as measured by digital subtraction angiography (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment group receiving 5 microL/hour of nimodipine and the control sham-operated group demonstrated the largest intracranial artery diameters with a significant difference between control <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-only group and the treatment group receiving 10 microL/hour of nimodipine (P = 0.0328, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variation in vessel calibers, however, did not result in different brain tissue alterations, even when using sensitive markers for the induction of the stress response or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracisternal nimodipine lavage with 5 microL/hour, but not with 10 microL/hour leads to significant arterial relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying cause of the decreasing nimodipine effect at higher dosage </plain></SENT>
