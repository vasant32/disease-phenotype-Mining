<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound blocks intracellular actions of calcium in a variety of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effects of HA1077 on the vascular actions of endothelin, an endothelium-derived vasoactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, in dogs in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal injections of endothelin (0.01 nmol) produced a significant vasospasm, as measured by angiography, similar to that seen in the canine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusion of HA1077 led to a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the spastic basilar artery in endothelin-treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rank order of in vitro contractile activity in canine cerebral arteries was a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> analog greater than endothelin greater than 5-hydroxytryptamine greater than <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha greater than <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> greater than <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HA1077 effectively antagonized the endothelin-induced contraction of canine basilar arterial strips in both calcium-containing and calcium-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that HA1077 is an effective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for endothelin in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
