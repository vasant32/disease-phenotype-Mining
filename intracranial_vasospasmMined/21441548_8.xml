<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial pressure waveform analysis of cardiac output (APCO) without external calibration (FloTrac/Vigileo™) is critically dependent upon computation of vascular tone that has necessitated several refinements of the underlying software algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that changes in vascular tone induced by high-dose vasopressor therapy affect the accuracy of APCO measurements independently of the FloTrac software version </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we assessed the validity of uncalibrated APCO measurements compared with transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output (TPCO) measurements in 24 patients undergoing vasopressor therapy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients received vasoactive support with [mean (sd)] 0.53 (0.46) µg kg(-1) min(-1) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> resulting in mean arterial pressure of 104 (14) mm Hg and mean systemic vascular resistance of 943 (248) dyn s(-1) cm(-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output (CO) data pairs (158) were obtained simultaneously by APCO and TPCO measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TPCO ranged from 5.2 to 14.3 litre min(-1), and APCO from 4.1 to 13.7 litre min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bias and limits of agreement were 0.9 and 2.5 litre min(-1), resulting in an overall percentage error of 29.6% for 68 data pairs analysed with the second-generation FloTrac(®) software and 27.9% for 90 data pairs analysed with the third-generation software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Precision of the reference technique was 2.6%, while APCO measurements yielded a precision of 29.5% and 27.9% for the second- and the third-generation software, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both software versions, bias (TPCO-APCO) correlated inversely with systemic vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In neurosurgical patients requiring high-dose vasopressor support, precision of uncalibrated CO measurements depended on systemic vascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the third software algorithm did not improve the insufficient precision (&gt;20%) for APCO measurements observed with the second software version </plain></SENT>
