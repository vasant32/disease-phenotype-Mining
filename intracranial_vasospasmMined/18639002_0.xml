<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported incidence of post-traumatic vasospasm (PTV) varies between 10% and 90%, probably largely because of differences in patient selection, in definitions of vasospasm and in methods of detecting spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In severe head injury, based on studies with similar criteria, the incidence is approximately 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTV is often associated with traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (tSAH), but has been reported without tSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two factors are independently associated with poor outcome, but the direct links between tSAH, vasospasm and outcome are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> improve outcome in patients with head injury and tSAH; aminosteroids may also be effective here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other strategies such as maintaining normocapnia and control of blood volume and pressure may also be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of large cohorts is required to clarify fully the significance of PTV, its relationship with tSAH and outcome and possible treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
