<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have tested the hypothesis that shedding of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and the resulting activation of the tyrosine kinase EGF receptor (EGFR) underlie OxyHb-induced K(V) channel suppression in the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of the conventional whole cell patch-clamp technique, two EGFR ligands, EGF and HB-EGF, were found to mimic OxyHb-induced K(V) suppression in rabbit cerebral artery myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>K(V) current suppression by OxyHb or EGF ligands was eliminated by a specific EGFR inhibitor, AG-1478, but was unaffected by PKC inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compounds (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and CRM-197) that specifically interfere with HB-EGF signaling eliminated OxyHb-induced K(V) suppression, suggesting that HB-EGF is the EGFR ligand involved in this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HB-EGF exists as a precursor protein that, when cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), causes EGFR activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMP activation was detected in OxyHb-treated arteries by gelatin zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the MMP inhibitor (GM-6001) abolished OxyHb-induced K(V) current suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed K(V) current suppression due to EGFR activation in human cerebral artery myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data demonstrate that OxyHb induces MMP activation, causing HB-EGF shedding and enhanced EGFR activity, ultimately leading to K(V) channel suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that EGFR-mediated K(V) suppression contributes to vascular pathologies, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and may play a more widespread role in the regulation of regional blood flow and peripheral resistance </plain></SENT>
