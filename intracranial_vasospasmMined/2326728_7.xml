<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: those operated on by day 3 (group 1: 116 patients) and those operated on after day 20 or not operated on (group 2: 34 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severity of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on computed tomography scan and angiographic vasospasm were graded into 0-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm was observed in 95% of group 1 and in 88% of group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant difference could not be found between groups 1 and 2 in the angiographic vasospasm grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in group 1 was 18%, which was significantly lower than the 44% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grades II to III, the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low density area on computed tomography scan were 13% and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these rates were significantly lower than those in group 2, which were 50% and 36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade IV, no differences could be found between groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a close correlation between the angiographic vasospasm grades and the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in group 1, no correlation could be observed between the site of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or the timing of operations and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there is still a limit to the effect of early operation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grade IV, symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may be ameliorated by early operation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> grades II to III </plain></SENT>
