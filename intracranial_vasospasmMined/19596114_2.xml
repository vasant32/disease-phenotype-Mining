<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of SPC were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH and also in an experimental canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were collected from 11 patients with SAH, and from dogs that had received an injection of SPC into the cisterna magna to examine SPC kinetics in the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SPC was assayed using solid-phase extraction and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SPC concentrations in SAH patients on days 3, 8, and 14 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the canine model, rapid dilution of SPC in CSF was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination with data from previous studies, these results suggest that SPC is involved in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid dilution of SPC in CSF suggests that SPC is released into CSF at higher concentrations than those measured in the present study </plain></SENT>
