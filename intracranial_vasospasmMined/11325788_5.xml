<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vasoactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin (ET) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these studies we investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in sustained vasoconstriction induced by ET-1 in canine cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined the ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22507">aminoglycoside antibiotics</z:chebi> to reverse the effects mediated by ET-1 in canine cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells (CVSMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, BQ-123, showed a competitive inhibition of the ET-1 responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictor action of both ET-1 (0.5 nM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) (160 nM) was reversed by a selective PKC inhibitor, Ro-32-0432 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cerebral arteries precontracted with ET-1 the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> caused a concentration-dependent relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EC(50s) for the relaxation were as follows: 0.54+/-0.05, 0.63+/-0.01, 1.88+/-0.46 and 2.3+/-0.92 mM for gentamicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6104">kanamycin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gentamicin caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced responses in calcium free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PKC activity was elevated in CVSMC exposed to ET-1 (170%) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> (167%) for a period of time (60 min) corresponding to maximum tonic contraction induced by these agents in arterial rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The administration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> to CVSMC, in concentrations corresponding to the EC(50s) from contractility studies, reduced the effects of both ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> on PKC activity to the levels not different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These results show that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycosides</z:chebi> are able to inhibit sustained vasoconstriction induced by ET-1, an effect which is due, at least in part, to the inhibition of PKC </plain></SENT>
