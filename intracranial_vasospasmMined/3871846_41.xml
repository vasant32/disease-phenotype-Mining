<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contralateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, rCBF was slightly higher in the two patients who eventually recovered (15.0 and 16.2 ml/100 gm/min) than in the two who remained hemiparetic (12.0 and 11.7 ml/100 gm/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rCMRO2 measurements showed similar differences, with values of 1.34 and 2.60 ml/100 gm/min in the patients who recovered, and 0.72 and 1.66 ml/100 gm/min in those who did not </plain></SENT>
