<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the first demonstration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> nearly 60 years ago, the preponderance of research has focused on strategies to limit arterial narrowing and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent clinical and preclinical data indicate a functional dissociation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and neurological outcome, signaling the need for a paradigm shift in the study of brain injury following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early brain injury may contribute to poor outcome and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, elucidation of the complex cellular mechanisms underlying early brain injury remains a major challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advent of modern neuroproteomics has rapidly advanced scientific discovery by allowing proteome-wide screening in an objective, nonbiased manner, providing novel mechanisms of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the context of neurosurgery, proteomic analysis of patient-derived CSF will permit the identification of biomarkers and/or novel drug targets that may not be intuitively linked with any particular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present report, the authors discuss the utility of neuroproteomics with a focus on the roles for this technology in understanding SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors also provide data from our laboratory that identifies high-mobility group box protein-1 as a potential biomarker of neurological outcome following SAH in humans </plain></SENT>
