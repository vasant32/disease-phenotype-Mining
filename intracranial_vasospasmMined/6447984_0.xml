<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels revealed abundant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> fluorescence in the adventitia and in close contact with the media, but none within the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> fluorescence in the adventitia and in its appearance in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vessels with vasospasm which lasted for 2 or 5 h and responded to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, fluorescence was scarce in the adventitia, but abundant in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vessels with vasospasm unresponsive to spasmolytic agents, fluorescence was observed neither in the adventitia nor in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> in the media of spastic arteries plays an important role in the development of cerebral vasospams </plain></SENT>
