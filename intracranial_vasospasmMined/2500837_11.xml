<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to measure flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and internal carotid artery (ICA) and vasomotor reactivity to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospastic conditions lead to higher flow velocities through the narrow segment, lower peripheral stream resistance due to the post-stenotic pressure drop and lower vasodilating capacities of arterioles under <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In severe vasospastic conditions, the peripheral stream bed is already maximally dilated and the hypercapnic response is weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the peripheral vascular bed reacts normally to <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vasospastic situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results point out two dangerous conditions of vasospastic disease: 1) exhaustion of peripheral vasodilating capacities, and 2) hyperventilatory therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of these situations can result in a reduction of CBF to brain tissue, mainly for two reasons: 1) In the former, a further increase in vasospasm cannot be compensated for anymore when the peripheral arterioles are maximally dilated, and 2) in the latter, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> produces a strong peripheral vasoconstrictor response with further reduction of CBF </plain></SENT>
