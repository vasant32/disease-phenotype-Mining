<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although recent investigations have suggested that a Rho-kinase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization of vascular smooth muscle contraction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cerebral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary vasospasm</z:e>, the upstream of this signal transduction has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) may also be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi>, induces Rho-kinase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization in pig coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this present study was to examine the possible mediation of SPC in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization of the bovine middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the relation to signal transduction pathways mediated by Rho-kinase and PKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In intact <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, SPC induced a concentration-dependent (EC50=3.0 micromol/L) contraction, without [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In membrane-permeabilized <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, SPC induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization even in the absence of added <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>, which is required for activation of G-proteins coupled to membrane receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SPC-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization was blocked by a Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) and a dominant-negative Rho-kinase, but not by a pseudosubstrate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for conventional PKC, which abolished the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-independent contraction induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization was resistant to a Rho-kinase inhibitor and a dominant-negative Rho-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, SPC induced the translocation of cytosolic Rho-kinase to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that SPC is a novel messenger for Rho-kinase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization of cerebral arterial smooth muscle and, therefore, may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of abnormal contraction of the cerebral artery such as vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SPC/Rho-kinase pathway functions independently of the PKC pathway </plain></SENT>
