<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the diameter of the basilar artery were assessed by serial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diameter ratio at day 7 was calculated as the percent of the basilar artery diameter of a given angiogram with respect to that of its control (day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter ratios for the basilar artery following SAH in the control and vehicle-treated groups were 49.7% +/- 3.9% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and 50.1% +/- 1.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> was administered either by continuous intravenous injection for 7 days or by bolus injection for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/hr or 10 mg/kg/hr) significantly attenuated the narrowing of the basilar artery following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter ratios in these groups were 71.3% +/- 3.6% (1 mg/kg/hr) and 75.7% +/- 1.7% (10 mg/kg/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bolus administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg, every 12 hours) reduced the arterial narrowing following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diameter ratio on day 7 was 60.1% +/- 3.3%, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> is effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
