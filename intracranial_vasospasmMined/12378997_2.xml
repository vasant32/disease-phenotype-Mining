<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report is to describe preliminary findings in further development of a non invasive method to estimate regional cerebral oxygenation and perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed with a technique combining near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and indocyaningreen (ICG) dye dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful data analysis has been performed based on the decomposition in pulsatile and non-pulsatile components of NIRS absorption data collected before and during the passage of ICG through the vascular bed under the NIRS-detector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First measurements in patients with CVS suggest that the technique could become a powerful tool in the detection and treatment of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This non invasive technique can be done at the bedside, it seems to be safe, easy to perform and less time-consuming compared to conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of extracerebral bone and surface tissue on cerebral NIRS signal has not been clarified yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore a new subdural NIRS probe has been developed, which gives the opportunity to measure directly the concentration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23240">chromophores</z:chebi> in the brain without the influence of extracerebral contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In future comparative measurements with conventional NIRS probes on the scalp will allow to quantify and eliminate extracerebral contamination from the NIRS signal </plain></SENT>
