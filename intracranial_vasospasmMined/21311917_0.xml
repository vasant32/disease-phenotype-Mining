<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), the formation of subarachnoid clots and their associated resolution may be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To dissolve and wash out the subarachnoid clot is one of the therapeutic strategies for prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of recombinant streptokinase (r-SK), a synthetic plasminogen activator, which is added to degenerate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, one of the strongest spasmogenic substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of this therapy concerning the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were evaluated in a swine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen healthy porcine subjects were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each was randomly assigned to one of three groups: saline control (A), SAH treated with saline (B), and r-SK injection into the cisterna magna (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced by introduction of blood clots into the cisterna magna on each of 2 days in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24-h post-SAH, a one-time dosage of 15 mg of r-SK was administered to those subjects randomized to group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous drainage was applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter was evaluated by angiography before the induction of SAH and at day 7 following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pre- and post-SAH angiographs of subjects in group A determined no significant difference in mean vessel caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group B, pre- and post-SAH angiography indicated significant (p &lt; 0.05) reductions of the mean vessel caliber of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and basilar artery (BA) compared with the baseline values before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the r-SK treated group, the mean percent reduction in vessel caliber of the right ICA and BA on day 7 angiograms showed no significant difference compared with the baseline value before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was inhibited in the animals to whom r-SK was administered for 1 day after double administration of blood clots to the cisterna magna to induce SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the post-SAH presence of subarachnoid clots that contain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> might be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further degeneration of these clots by r-SK may have a promising effect for prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
