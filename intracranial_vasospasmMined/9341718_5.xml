<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the receptor subtypes for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and their mechanisms of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i mobilization in cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat basilar smooth muscle cells were isolated by an enzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response, a large transient peak followed by a slowly decaying plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potency of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> to raise [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i was ATP gamma S &gt; or = <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi> &gt; or = ATP approximately <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi> approximately <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, indicating that P2u receptors were expressed in the rat basilar smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> to release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> from internal stores was reduced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, by the phospholipase C inhibitor 2-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate, and by the Ca(2+)-pump inhibitor thapsigargin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results are the first demonstration that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> activate G protein-coupled P2u receptors to mobilize [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in rat basilar smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
