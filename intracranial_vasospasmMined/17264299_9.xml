<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations are increasingly used for therapy of several neuroimmunologic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IVIg therapy is considered safe, although serious side effects like aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, or ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These side effects are frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting a neutrophil-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the potential role of neutrophil activation, we analyzed IVIg preparations from 5 different commercial sources for the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>)-like immunoglobulins against <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-fixed peripheral-blood neutrophils, purified human antigens, and a panel of human and nonhuman tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IVIg batches tested (n = 13) contained atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> (IgG titer up to 1:2048, IgA up to 1:512) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparations were capable of inducing <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> production in TNFalpha-primed human neutrophils, with a significant correlation (P &lt; .005) between atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> titers in IVIg preparations and neutrophil activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fc-mediated binding and activation was ruled out by the use of IVIg-F(ab')(2) fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest that in vivo activation of TNFalpha-primed neutrophils by atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCAs</z:chebi> of IVIg may contribute to the side effects of IVIg therapy and for the first time demonstrate that the activation of neutrophil granulocytes by IVIg occurs in an Fc receptor (FcR)-independent, hence antigen-dependent, way </plain></SENT>
