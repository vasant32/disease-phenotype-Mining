<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients, who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, received hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (500 ml/day) postoperatively to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the 44 patients with prominent SAH on the computed tomographic (CT) scan, anticipating to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to vasospasm, were given dobutamine (DOB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BP was maintained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, and the heart rate was kept below 130/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 24 patients treated with DOB, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured repeatedly by the 133Xe intravenous injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 of these 24 patients, the cardiovascular function was monitored with Swan-Ganz (S-G) catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 44 patients (27%) developed delayed neurological deficits associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits were reversed by the administration of DOB, at a dose of 8-25 (average 12.4) micrograms/kg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 43 patients, the ischemic lesions associated with vasospasm did not appear on CT scan and the patients were of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, one patient showed multiple low-density lesions on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was because of the failure of hyperdynamic therapy due to pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to volume overload was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the 24 patients with prominent SAH, CBF increased significantly by up to 20% following DOB administration, although the BP stayed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
