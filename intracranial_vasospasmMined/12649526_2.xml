<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a locoregional cervical sympathetic block to improve cerebral perfusion in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with symptoms of delayed ischemic deficits, induced by angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, were treated with the injection of locoregional anesthesia to block the ascending cervical sympathetic chain at the level of the superior cervical ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was recorded before and after the procedure, and cerebral angiography was performed before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No complications occurred in this short series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure appeared to be simple and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Horner's signs appeared within 12+/-0.1 minutes and lasted for an average of 6.3+/-4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, improved cerebral perfusion was detected at the confirmatory angiography but without change in vessel caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died of the complications of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and 2 died of the consequences of the severe vasospasm despite maximal medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other cases, the neurological status promptly returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 48 hours after the locoregional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild to moderate symptoms seem to benefit greatly from transient ipsilateral cervical sympathetic block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This simple technique may be helpful when used as an adjunct to the standard therapy to improve cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
