<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Preliminary in vitro experiments were performed to determine the serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in the monkey, and the ability of cyproheptadine to block <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and serum-induced contractions in monkey cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cynomolgus monkeys were subsequently used to study changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) obtained by the intracartoid 133Xe technique, and in the angiographic cerebral arterial caliber resulting from subarachnoid injection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five animals in each injection group were given 1.0 mg/kg intravenous cyproheptadine (a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-blocking agent) during the post-injection period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subarachnoid injection of artificial CSF produced no change in CBF or arterial caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-injection administration of cyproheptadine also had no effect on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subarachnoid injection of fresh autogenous blood produced a significant but transient (less than 1 hour) decrease in CBF and moderate vasospasm, which lasted at least 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This vasospasm was essentially unaffected by intravenous cyproheptadine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF and arterial caliber were unchanged following a subarachnoid injection of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> at concentrations (5 x 10(-6)M) present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monkey serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 5 x 10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> invariably produced near maximal contractions in the in vitro cerebral artery preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher (x10) <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> concentrations caused a transient CBF response similar to that obtained with blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced was of shorter duration than that obtained with blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results do not support a major role for <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in the production of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data indicate that in vitro experiments do not reflect the ability of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> to constrict cerebral arteries in the intact animal </plain></SENT>
