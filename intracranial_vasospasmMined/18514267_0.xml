<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, ischemic neurologic deficits related to vasospasm are still the leading causes of mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well known that vasospasm is a dynamic process affected by various factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of vasospasm in animal models and clinical observations differ from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This variability has not been completely explained by blood and blood degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, metabolites released from the damaged vessel wall during the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> are thought to play an important role in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHOD: To test this hypothesis, we used 46 male Wistar rats that were divided into 7 groups and administered one of the following to cisterna magna: venous blood, arterial blood, arterial wall homogenate, venous wall homogenate, combined mixture of arterial blood and artery wall homogenate, or combined mixture of venous blood and venous wall homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brainstems of the rats were excised, and the basilar arteries were harvested for morphometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULT: There were significant differences between the degree of vasospasm caused by arterial and venous blood (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal area of the basilar artery was significantly narrower after application of arterial blood, artery wall homogenate, or their combination (49% +/- 1%) than after venous groups (30% +/- 1.9%) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this experiment demonstrated that metabolites from vessel walls play as important roles in the pathophysiology of vasospasm as blood and blood degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of these metabolites will improve our understanding of vasospasm, pathophysiology, and its treatment </plain></SENT>
