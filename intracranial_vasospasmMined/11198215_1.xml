<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was occluded with detachable coils followed by intra-arterial infusion of papaverine to treat vasospasm as an one-stage procedure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-term clinical outcome in one patient was excellent, the other still has minor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> therapy followed by intra-arterial spasmolysis with papaverine is a technically feasible therapeutic alternative in patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
