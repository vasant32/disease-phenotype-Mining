<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substances acting primarily via the inhibition of calcium entry into the cell have been divided into four distinct classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological characteristics of these classes that may be relevant for the use in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> are highlighted in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some main differences concern the effects on vascular smooth muscle cells and brain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The well-documented clinical applications in neurology are still limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> prophylaxis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evidence concerning the usefulness in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was regarded as reasonable, whereas several neurological indications should still be regarded as being under examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is little doubt that calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> will gain importance in the treatment of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
