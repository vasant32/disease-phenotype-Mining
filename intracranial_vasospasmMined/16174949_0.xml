<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In serial TCD measurements, some patients exhibit CBFV temporal profiles with two peaks (biphasic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The significance of this finding remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This retrospective case-control study was conducted to investigate the characteristics and possible predictors of biphasic CBFV profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biphasic CBFV profiles were identified in serial TCD examinations (every 1-2 days) of 182 consecutive patients admitted for aneurysmal SAH based on CBFV profiles of the middle cerebral artery on the side of higher maximum velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing angioplasty were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients meeting these criteria (study patients) were compared to control patients matched for age and Hunt and Hess grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (9.9%) demonstrated biphasic CBFV profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first CBFV (134 +/- 11 cm/second) peak occurred on post-SAH day 6 +/- 1, and the second peak (148 +/- 12 cm/second) on day 13 +/- 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study patients more often exhibited focal (p &lt; 0.05) symptoms at the time of the first peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient deteriorated neurologically at the time of the second peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between CBVF and mean arterial pressure or central venous pressure trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serial TCD assessment identifies patients with SAH and a biphasic CBFV temporal profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the second peak usually is not associated with a worsening of symptoms, these patients were more likely to exhibit clinical symptoms during the first CBFV peak </plain></SENT>
