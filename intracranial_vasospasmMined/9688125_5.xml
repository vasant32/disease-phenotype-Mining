<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isometric tension was used to monitor contractions in rabbit basilar arteries induced by erythrocyte lysate, 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> in the absence or presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> produced concentration-dependent contractions in rabbit basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> tyrphostin A23 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> (30 and 100 microM), but not diadzein, an inactive analog of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, attenuated significantly the contraction induced by erythrocyte lysate (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tyrphostin A23, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, and diadzein (30 microM) failed to reduce the contraction caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi>, but not tyrphostin A23 or diadzein (30 microM), attenuated significantly the contraction induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another series, arterial rings were initially contracted with erythrocyte lysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and the relaxant effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> was then tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">Genistein</z:chebi> relaxed rabbit basilar arteries that had been contracted by exposure to erythrocyte lysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (30-100 microM; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that tyrosine kinase may play a role in the regulation of cerebral arterial contraction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> may be useful in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
