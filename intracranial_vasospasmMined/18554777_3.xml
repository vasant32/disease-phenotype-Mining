<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilating agents for patients suffering from severe vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is often unsatisfying and there is still demand for further last resort treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current prospective study, we attempted the intrathecal lavage administration of nimodipine in cases of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that were refractory to medical and endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight of 146 patients with aneurysmal SAH were included in the prospective study, which had been approved by the local ethics committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was instituted by intraventricular nimodipine bolus (0.4 mg), followed by a continuous lumbar intrathecal infusion (0.4 mg/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was monitored angiographically, with transcranial Doppler (TCD), perfusion CT (pCT), and by neurological examination during treatment course and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological condition improved directly in three patients and remained unchanged in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (70.8%) CT perfusion analyses revealed improved perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reduction of vasospasm was seen angiographically by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in seven (66.6%) investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional ischaemic infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the intrathecal therapy was documented in two (25%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse effects observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study has for the first time demonstrated the feasibility and safety of intrathecal nimodipine lavage in patients with severe vasospasm resistant to the established medical and endovascular treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of the study are therefore encouraging, and further experimental and clinical trials should be carried out so as to investigate the efficacy of intrathecal nimodipine lavage in vasospasm therapy </plain></SENT>
