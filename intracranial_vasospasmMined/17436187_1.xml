<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The development of a computerized method which allows a direct quantitative comparison of perfusion parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The display should allow a clear direct comparison of brain perfusion parameters in different vascular territories and over the course of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis is intended to be the basis for further evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method should permit early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Angiotux 2D-ECCET software was developed with a close cooperation between computer scientists and clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting from parameter images of brain perfusion, the cortex was marked, segmented and assigned to definite vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The underlying values were averages for each segment and were displayed in a graph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If a follow-up was available, the mean values of the perfusion parameters were displayed in relation to time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method was developed under consideration of CT perfusion values but is applicable for other methods of perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computerized analysis of brain perfusion parameter images allows an immediate comparison of these parameters and follow-up of mean values in a clear and concise manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Values are related to definite vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The tabular output facilitates further statistic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The computerized analysis is precisely reproducible, i. e., repetitions result in exactly the same output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Computerized analysis of brain perfusion parameters with Angiotux 2D-ECCET is objective and ensures reproducible results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It may become the basis and a requirement for the analysis of minimal changes in brain perfusion prior to irreversible damage from posthemorrhagic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
