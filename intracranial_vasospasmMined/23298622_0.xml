<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to examine the feasibility of nimodipine loaded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> microparticles suspended in Tisseel(™) fibrin sealant as an in situ forming depot system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This device locally placed can be used for the treatment of vasospasm after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microparticles were prepared via spray drying by using the vibration mesh spray technology of Nano Spray Dryer B-90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spherically shaped microparticles with different loadings and high encapsulation efficiencies of 93.3% to 97.8% were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on nimodipine loading (10% - 40%) the particle diameter ranged from 1.9 ± 1.2 μm to 2.4 ± 1.3μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thermal analyses using DSC revealed that Nimodipine is dissolved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> loaded microparticles were encapsulated in Tisseel(™) to examine the homogeneity of particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3D-pictures of the in situ forming devices displayed uniform particle homogeneity in the sealant matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drug release was examined by fluorescence spectrophotometry which demonstrated a drug release proportional to the square root of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A prolonged drug release of 19.5 h was demonstrated under in vitro conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the Nimodipine in situ forming device could be a promising candidate for the local treatment of vasospasm after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
