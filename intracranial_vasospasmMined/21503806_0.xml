<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is one of the most serious complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral artery diameter is regulated by complex physiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis seems to play a crucial role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors (RYRs) are involved in regulating the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> calcium concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this gene association investigation, we studied the question as to whether variants in the gene for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors subtype 1 (RYR1) are associated with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After informed consent genomic DNA analysis was performed from a whole blood sample in 46 patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>16 Patients were affected by symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RYR1 gene was screened for possible genetic variants by means of direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of these variants was correlated to the development of symptomatic vasospasm, which was confirmed by clinical examination combined with cerebral angiography, transcranial doppler sonography, or CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three different genetic RYR1 variants (c.5360C&gt;T, c.6178G&gt;T, and c.7244G&gt;A) were identified in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The G/T genotype of RYR1 c.6178G&gt;T was associated with an increased risk for development of symptomatic vasospasm (odds ratio 6.4; 95% CI 1.1-37.8; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our pilot study suggests that RYRs are involved in the complex pathophysiology of vasospasm development following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The potential role of RYR1 as a biomarker for prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH has to be confirmed in a larger clinical trial </plain></SENT>
