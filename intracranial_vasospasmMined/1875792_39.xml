<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that the conversion of big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) to endothelin-1 (ET-1) is specifically inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitor phosphoramidon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of phosphoramidon on delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) using a two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the vasospasm and the drug effect were determined angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On SAH Day 7, diameter of the basilar artery decreased to about 55% of the control value obtained before SAH (on Day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive ET (IR-ET) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) significantly increased after SAH (on Day 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intracisternal pretreatment of phosphoramidon potently suppressed the decrease in diameter of the basilar artery after SAH, i.e., observed decrease was only about 20%, compared with the value before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the phosphoramidon group, IR-ET in CSF markedly increased (on SAH Day 2), but the increased levels of IR-ET significantly declined on SAH Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results clearly indicate that phosphoramidon effectively prevents delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the prevention is due to the inhibition of conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 is now under study </plain></SENT>
