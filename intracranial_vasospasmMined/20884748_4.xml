<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In recent years, the role of CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> for vasospasm diagnosis in the setting of ASAH has been the subject of many research studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> for vasospasm in patients with ASAH by using DSA as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search strategy for research studies was based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews, including literature data bases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science) and reference lists of manuscripts published from January 1996 to February 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were the following: 1) published manuscripts, 2) original research studies with prospective or retrospective data, 3) patients with ASAH, 4) CTA or <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> as the index test, and 5) DSA as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three reviewers independently assessed the quality of these research studies by using the QUADAS tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, DOR, and the SROC curve were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> searches yielded 505 and 214 manuscripts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten research studies met inclusion criteria for each CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six CTA and 3 CTP studies had sufficient data for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTA pooled estimates had 79.6% sensitivity (95%CI, 74.9%-83.8%), 93.1%specificity (95%CI, 91.7%-94.3%), 18.1 LR+ (95%CI, 7.3-45.0), and 0.2 LR- (95%CI, 0.1-0.4); and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> pooled estimates had 74.1% sensitivity (95%CI, 58.7%- 86.2%), 93.0% specificity (95% CI, 79.6%-98.7%), 9.3 LR+ (95%CI, 3.4-25.9), and 0.2 LR- (95%CI, 0.04-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall DORs were 124.5 (95%CI, 28.4-546.4) for CTA and 43.0 (95%CI, 6.5-287.1) for <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Area under the SROC curve was 98 ± 2.0%for CTA and 97 ± 3.0% for <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high diagnostic accuracy determined for both CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> in this meta-analysis suggests that they are potentially valuable techniques for vasospasm diagnosis in ASAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Awareness of these results may impact patient care by providing supportive evidence for more effective use of CTA and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> imaging in ASAH </plain></SENT>
