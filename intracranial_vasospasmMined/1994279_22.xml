<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the elaboration of iron from the subarachnoid clot might result in enhanced generation of free radicals and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If so, then treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, an iron-chelating compound, might reduce the formation of free radicals and thereby ameliorate vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was examined in a rabbit model of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New Zealand White rabbits were divided into the following experimental groups: control (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) animals (n = 7), control animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (n = 3), animals subjected to SAH and killed on Day 2 (n = 7), animals subjected to SAH on Day 2 and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (n = 9), animals subjected to SAH killed on Day 3 (n = 7), and animals subjected to SAH on Day 3 and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi> treatment (50 mg/kg/8 hours) was begun 16 hours before the induction of SAH and continued until the animals were killed by perfusion fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery caliber was assessed using morphometric techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar arteries in the control animals was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm </plain></SENT>
