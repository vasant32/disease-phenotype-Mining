<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cisternal blood injections induced both global and focal changes in CBF and CMRglu six days following SAH, the timepoint of maximal late spasm in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a global decrease in CBF of about 30% accompanied by an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake of about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of seven animals also had foci with flow decreased to 40% of control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake increased to 300% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an altered but still present interdependence between flow and metabolism post SAH </plain></SENT>
