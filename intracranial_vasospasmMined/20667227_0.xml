<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged from 70 to 86 years old (mean 77.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale revealed that 6 patients were in grade I, 5 in grade II, 2 in grade III, 12 in grade IV, and 1 in grade V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are as follows; 10 were in the internal carotid artery, 7 in the anterior cerebral artery, 1 in the middle cerebral artery, and 8 in the vertebro- basilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-aneurysmal occlusion was accomplished in 25 patients, resulting in 6 complete occlusion (24%), 3 neck remnant (12%), 11 body filling (44%), and both of neck remnant and body filling in 5 (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient with vertebral artery union <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the parent artery was occluded just proximal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 13 patients with good clinical grade (grade I, II, and III) resulted in good clinical outcome, whereas 11 of 13 patients with poor clinical grade (grade IV and V) showed poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and intra-procedural rupture occurred in 5 patients (19.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of the complications was attributed to severe atherosclerotic changes of parent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurred in only one patient (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, endovascular coil emboilization is a useful therapeutic alternative for treating ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients over 70 years of age, especially in patients with good clinical grade (better than grade III) </plain></SENT>
