<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty has emerged as an additional, effective treatment for symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of autoregulation, however, can occur despite effective angioplasty, underscoring the need for treatment with hyperdynamic therapy in combination with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old woman underwent endovascular coiling of a ruptured left posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient went on to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was treated with hyperdynamic therapy and angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation was assessed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An initial CBF study was obtained when the patient received <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and dobutamine infusions to maintain systolic blood pressure at 160 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vasopressor drips were then temporarily held for twenty minutes, allowing the patient's systolic blood pressure to drop to 140 mmHg, and a repeat CBF study was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several days after angioplasty, CBF decreased significantly when the patient was taken off vasopressors, indicating impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyperdynamic therapy was continued, and another CBF study one week later showed a return of autoregulation and normalization of CBF without induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation is disturbed during vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although angioplasty can improve large artery blood flow during vasospasm, hyperdynamic therapy is also needed to maintain cerebral perfusion, particularly in the face of impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quantitative CBF measurement permits the maintenance of optimal CBF and monitoring of response to therapy </plain></SENT>
