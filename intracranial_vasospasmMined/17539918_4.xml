<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can lead to ischemic injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and is a common complication of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, usually occurring 3-9 days afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of vasospasm is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been strong evidence that vasoactive oxidation products of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, the factors that lead to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation are poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have designed an in vitro model of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in order to investigate conditions that promote the oxidation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> to form vasoactive compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using our model, we created a basic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> system of blood, CSF, and hemeoxygenase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We manipulated this system in various ways, incubated it and determined the concentration of vasoactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products that resulted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conditions where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase was stimulated caused an increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products (292.6 +/- 39.9 micromol/L respectively, vs. 79.3 +/- 1.3 micromol/L for the basic reaction, p &lt; 0.05), which was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products may be produced by oxidation(s) requiring an oxygen-utilizing enzyme like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
