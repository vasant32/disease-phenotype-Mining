<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this prospective study was to analyse small band-like cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with reference to additional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 5-year period between January 2002 and January 2007 10 out of 188 patients with aneurysmal SAH were evaluated (one patient Hunt and Hess grade I, one patient grade II, four patients grade III, two patients grade IV, and two patients grade V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The imaging protocol included serially performed MRI with diffusion- and perfusion-weighted images (DWI/PWI) at three time points after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) was analysed on follow-up DSA on day 7+/-3 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lesions were located in the frontal lobe (n=10), in the insular cortex (n=3) and in the parietal lobe (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The band-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred after a mean time interval of 5.8 days (range 3-10 days) and showed unexceptional adjacent thick sulcal clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven out of ten patients with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had no or mild CVS, and in the remaining three patients DSA disclosed moderate (n=2) or severe (n=1) CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern after aneurysmal SAH includes cortical band-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the white matter which develop as a result of moderate or severe proximal and/or distal vasospasm visible on angiography, the cortical band-like lesions adjacent to sulcal clots may also develop without evidence of macroscopic vasospasm, implying a vasospastic reaction of the most distal superficial and intraparenchymal vessels </plain></SENT>
