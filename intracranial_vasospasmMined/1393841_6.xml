<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this theory, vasospasm was induced in monkeys by intrathecal injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> or supernatant fluid from autologous blood incubated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentration of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), a product of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in association with vasospasm caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and supernatant fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal injections of methemoglobin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> did not cause vasospasm or increased CSF <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity although there was a trend towards higher activities in animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, methemoglobin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and supernatant fluid </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, detection of peroxidation products after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> in the absence of erythrocyte membranes indicates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> may directly damage cerebral arteries and brain by inducing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in these structures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In fact, there was a tendency for vasospasm to elevate enzyme activities, as if production of scavengers was induced by excess free radicals in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
