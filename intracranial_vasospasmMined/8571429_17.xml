<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is refractory to most <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite evidence that a mechanism underlying the vasospasm may be smooth muscle cell membrane depolarization resulting from decreased K+ conductance, the ability of K+ channel activators to relax the spasm has not been thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether K+ channel activation selectively relaxes SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three days after SAH in the rabbit, relaxation of the basilar artery in response to the K+ channel activator cromakalim as well as to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> (protein kinase C <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (adenylate cyclase activator), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (guanylate cyclase activator) was measured in situ with the use of a cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relaxation in response to these agents was also investigated in control vessels contracted with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Membrane potential of the smooth muscle cells of the basilar artery from SAH and control rabbit was measured in vitro with the use of intracellular microelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cromakalim completely relaxed the SAH-induced spastic basilar artery, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> were significantly less efficacious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> were more efficacious relaxants in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-contracted control vessels than in SAH vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The K+ channel blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">[K+]</z:chebi> prevented cromakalim-induced relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glyburide</z:chebi> did not inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-induced relaxation of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-contracted control vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cromakalim concentration-dependently repolarized spastic basilar artery smooth muscle cells, and the repolarization was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that K+ channel activation selectively relaxes SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the ability of K+ channel activators to selectively relax the spasm may be due, at least in part, to the underlying inhibition of K+ channels after SAH </plain></SENT>
