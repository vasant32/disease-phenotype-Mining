<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of endothelin-1 (ET-1), its involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has been suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed various experiments, first to demonstrate the presence of ET in both patients and dogs with SAH, and second to examine the effects of ET synthesis inhibition in experimental vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that ET was present in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in SAH, but did not correlate with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, ET was locally expressed in the vascular endothelium in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several therapeutic approaches causing the inhibition of ET synthesis were effective in preventing the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such approaches utilized drugs that inhibited <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> treatment was most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also utilized phosphoramidon, a recently found conversion inhibitor of big ET to ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this product failed to ameliorate the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although we cannot yet conclude that ET is the main cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, it may, at least, act as one of the modifying factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
