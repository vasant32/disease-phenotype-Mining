<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By the beginning of the XIXth Century the old belief that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was due to demonic possession or to malevolent influences emanating from a variety of sources had largely given way to an acceptance that the disorder was a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">physical illness</z:e> which arose in the brain, though in some not very precisely defined way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No even reasonably satisfactory hypotheses about epileptogenesis were available till Marshall Hall (1790-1857), from 1836 onwards, popularised the concept of reflex action which had earlier been described by Robert Whytt (1714-1776) under the name 'sympathy' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marshall Hall interpreted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> as due to abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> in the afferent limb or central section of what later came to be called the reflex arc, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> being the result of secondary cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This concept of epileptogenesis was refined by Brown-SÃ©quard, who in 1858 ascribed a more important role to overt or occult peripheral afferent nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, considered that the central element of the relevant reflex mechanism involved the medulla oblongata, and believed that reflex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, rather than cerebral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost contemporaneously, Schroeder van der Kolk placed considerably greater emphasis on the medullary element in causing the increased excitability of the reflex arc that produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ideas of exaggerated reflex activity as the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were made redundant by the work of Hughlings Jackson (1837-1911), who from 1860 onwards demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> arose in the cerebrum itself, rather than from altered function at lower levels of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
