<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes preliminary findings in further development of a noninvasive method that estimates regional cerebral oxygenation and perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 50-year-old patient suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> before and after superselective papaverine infusion was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken by using a technique combining indocyaningreen dye dilution and near infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our first results suggest that the technique could be suitable for estimation of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This noninvasive technique can be performed at the bedside and in special environments, such as neurocritical care units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seems to be safe, easy to perform, and less time-consuming than conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of indocyaningreen dye dilution and near infrared spectroscopy might become a powerful tool in the detection and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> causing delayed cerebral ischemic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further larger-scale investigations are necessary to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary observations however, based on measurements before and after superselective papaverine infusion in vasospastic vessels, helped to clarify the influence of extracerebral contamination on the cerebral near infrared spectroscopy signal in the adult head </plain></SENT>
