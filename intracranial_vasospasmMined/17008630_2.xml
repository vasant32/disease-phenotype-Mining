<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients with clinically suspect severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aSAH underwent cerebral angiography before endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm severity was assessed for each patient by transcranial Doppler measurements, angiography, and (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>-SPECT) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percentage of BA narrowing was calculated in reference to the baseline angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BA narrowing &gt;or=25% was found in 23 of 65 patients, and delayed brain stem (BS) hypoperfusion, as estimated by <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>-SPECT, was found in 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 23 patients with BA narrowing &gt;or=25% experienced BS hypoperfusion, whereas only 2 of 42 patients with &gt;or=25% BA narrowing experienced BS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression after adjusting for age with Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and aneurysmal location as covariables revealed BA narrowing &gt;or=25% and delayed BS hypoperfusion to be significantly and independently associated with unfavorable 3-month outcome (P=0.0001; odds ratio, 10.1; 95% CI, 2.5 to 40.8; and P=0.007; odds ratio, 13.8, 95% CI, 2.18 to 91.9, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest for the first time that BA vasospasm after aSAH is an independent and significant prognostic factor associated with poor outcome in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> requiring endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study should be done to evaluate the role of interventional therapy on outcome in patients with posterior circulation vasospasm </plain></SENT>
