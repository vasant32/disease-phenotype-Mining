<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, coagulation and fibrinolytic studies were performed during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage through <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tested items were partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, FDP, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, antithrombin III, fibrinogen, besides, fibrinopeptide A (FPA), and fibrinopeptide B beta (FPB beta) which were being worthy of note </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood were sampled from peripheral vein (V) and internal jugular vein at jugular bulb (J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And, moreover, cerebrospinal fluid (L) were collected as possible as we could for measuring FPA and FPB beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The obtained results were summarized as follows; Within forty-eight hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, FPA-V, J,L and FPB beta-V, J,L were statistically higher than those of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FPA-J and FPB beta-V, J, within forty-eight hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were statistically higher in the cases with brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than in the survived cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the third to fifth day from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> when so called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> became apparent to begin, FPA and FPB beta had a tendency to be higher than other periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase of fibrinogen delayed from the peaks of FPA and FPB beta showing the peaks at the seventh to the fourteenth day from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three cases with symptomatic vasospasm, FPA and FPB beta showed maximal values two to four days prior to the appearance of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
