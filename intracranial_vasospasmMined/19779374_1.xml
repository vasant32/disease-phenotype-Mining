<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of intraperitoneal administration of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, which is an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was investigated in an experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By means of intracisternal blood injection model, SAH was induced in 24 rabbits, which were randomly divided into 3 groups (group 1= control group, group 2=SAH alone group, and group 3=SAH plus <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery angiography was performed on day 0 and day 3 as described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (0.05 mg/kg) treatment was started after the induction of SAH and administered once a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days later, the animals were killed and the basilar artery was examined histologically for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter and thickness of the arterial muscular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values for the measurements of angiographic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter, pathologic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area, muscular wall thickness derived from the blind observer were analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in basal angiographic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter evaluation between groups 1-2-3 (P&gt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But in third day angiography; comparison of group 2 and group 1-3 showed statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In pathologic investigation; there was statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and muscular wall thickness of the basilar artery between groups 1, 2, and 3 (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> treatment was found effective by increasing the angiographic diameter; pathologic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area and reducing muscular wall thickness measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to show that intraperitoneal administration of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> is effective in preventing vasospasm after SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
