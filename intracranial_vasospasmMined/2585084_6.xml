<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spastic basilar artery was exposed via the transclival route under a surgical microscope and was dilated by the topical application of 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexa-1,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47918">diazepine</z:chebi> (ML-9), a selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of myosin light chain kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dilation was dose-dependent, with a median effective dose (+/- standard deviation) of 51.4 +/- 6.9 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 50 microM of ML-9 was injected into the cisterna magna until the intracranial pressure (ICP) reached 200 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> for 30 minutes, including a complete reversal of angiographic delayed vasospasm in three of seven dogs; in contrast, 150 microM of ML-9 was infused at 1.52 ml/min into the vertebral artery for 30 minutes, producing little dilation of the spastic basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another study, the intracisternal perfusion of 50 microM of ML-9 at 1.48 ml/min for 30 minutes in dogs with an ICP of less than 200 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> produced no serious electroencephalographic abnormalities, and the mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; no neurological deficits or significant histological abnormalities ascribable to the intracisternal ML-9 were found </plain></SENT>
