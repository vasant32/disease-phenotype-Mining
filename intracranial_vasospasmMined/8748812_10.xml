<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 66 of 122 patients who underwent early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery between 1990 and 1993, the intracranial haemodynamics were documented by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>33 of these 66 patients received high dose nicardipine intravenously (Group I); the other 33 patients were not treated with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 6 Group I patients (18%) and in 13 (39%) in Group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 symptomatic patients received an intra-arterial infusion of papaverine; 15 patients (79%) responded well to this therapy and the symptoms were reversed quickly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mean flow velocity (MFV) was not different between the two groups, it was reduced significantly after papverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our retrospective analysis suggests that symptomatic vasospasm can be treated effectively with the combination of intravenous high dose nicardipine and intra-arterial infusion of papaverine, and that the correct timing of the infusions is crucial </plain></SENT>
