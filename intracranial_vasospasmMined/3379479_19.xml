<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contractile and ultrastructural changes of the cells were examined with electron microscopy during the first 2 weeks of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> not only produced progressive contraction of the arterial smooth-muscle cells, but it also caused ultrastructural changes that resembled myonecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no evidence of progressive contraction or ultrastructural changes either in control cultures or in cultures with the other vasoactive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although washout of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> 3 hours after administration prevented continued contraction of the cells, washout 24 hours or longer after administration had no preventive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Judging from these results and from the fact that the culture medium was changed every 2 days, it is unlikely that accumulation of exogenous vasoactive agents caused these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The contraction and suggestive myonecrosis of the arterial smooth-muscle cells are probably caused by some intrinsic process initiated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The culture of cerebral arterial smooth-muscle cells requires further technical improvement; nevertheless, these results obtained with the smooth-muscle cells of rat aortic media indicate that arterial smooth-muscle cells in culture provide a promising new experimental model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in vitro study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested from these results that cerebral arteries are particularly prone to vasospasm because of structural differences as compared to noncerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
