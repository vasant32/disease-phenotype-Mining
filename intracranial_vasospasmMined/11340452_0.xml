<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its early and non invasive detection by transcranial Doppler (TCD) may contribute to a better prognosis in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To discuss the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary cerebral to spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the flow velocities registered by TCD in intracranial arteries in 31 patients with SAH, performed sequentially, associated with neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (except one) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical vasospasm was found in 11 patients (36,6% from the total), with correspondent sonographic vasospasm present in 9 cases (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases (33.3%) the flow velocity alterations preceded the clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between the 20 asymptomatic patients, 15 (75%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow velocity, with evidence of sonographic vasospasm without clinical repercussion in 5 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The index of false negatives in the correlation between clinical examination and TCD (symptomatic vasospasm with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow velocity records) was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was correspondence between clinical and ultrasonographic findings in 26 of the 31 patients (83.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average flow velocity values in the various arteries and its interpretation for each subgroup are discussed with further details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD is a valuable auxiliary method in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (even pre-symptomatic) secondary to SAH, allowing a more precocious therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results are similar to those described in the literature </plain></SENT>
