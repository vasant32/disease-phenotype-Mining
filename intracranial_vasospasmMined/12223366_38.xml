<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the widespread use of angioplasty, adjunct chemical therapy is often needed to treat patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the safety of intraarterial administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein summarize our 2-year experience with this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, anesthesia records, clinical charts, and brain images of 29 patients who received intraarterially administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> in 34 procedures for the treatment of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from July 1998 to June 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were used to measure cardiovascular side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurologic effects were assessed by angiographic findings, the results of neurologic examinations performed before and after the procedure, and findings of CT of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> per patient was 3 +/- 0 mg or 44 +/- 5 mcg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average changes in mean arterial pressure at 10 and 20 minutes were -5 +/- 1 mm Hg and -2 +/- 1 mm Hg or -3.8 +/- 1.0% and -1.7 +/- 1.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant change of heart rate was observed at 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients showed no sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> by hemodynamic parameters, neurologic examination, or CT of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On 10 occasions, when the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> infusion was assessed angiographically, there was 44 +/- 9% increase of vessel diameter in the spastic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurologic improvement was noted after five of 17 procedures when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was used as the sole treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> is safe when administered intraarterially to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects are achieved in some patients, prompting further study of its efficacy </plain></SENT>
