<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vasospasm is a major cause of ischemic neurological deficits developing after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal was to identify hemodynamic changes and the presence of clinical vasospasm in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Pre- and postoperative serial transcranial cerebral oximetry and transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) examinations were performed in 75 patients operated for aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference (p=0.14) was found in the levels of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) between patients with vasospasm and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients who developed clinical vasospasm, the blood flow velocity values were significantly higher compared with those who did not (127.5+/-2.7 versus 92.5+/-1.2 cm/sec, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six patients with clinical vasospasm and low TCCO measurements, the use of triple-H therapy led to oxygen saturation increment and clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial cerebral oximetry seems to be of limited value for the detection of vasospasm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it may be useful in estimating the clinical impact of triple-H therapy in such patients </plain></SENT>
