<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the resting condition, levcromakalim reduced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and vascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levcromakalim suppressed the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced increases in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and force of contraction, the maximum effects of which were much greater than those of nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of levcromakalim were blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) or iberiotoxin (IbTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of levcromakalim, the curve relating [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i with force in the presence of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> at different extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]o) was shifted down- and right-ward compared with that in the absence of levcromakalim, suggesting that levcromakalim may reduce the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of the contractile proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, levcromakalim may be a good candidate to suppress delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
