<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> stimulates vasoconstriction and oxygen consumption in the porcine carotid artery in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of oxygen consumption has been used as an in vitro model of vasospasm to assess the relative benefits of nimodipine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>, dobutamine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Samples of human CSF were obtained from SAH patients and applied to de-endothelialised porcine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of oxygen consumption (as an in vitro marker for a stimulation of the vessels) was monitored and the effects of SNP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>, dobutamine or nimodipine were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The CSF from SAH patients with evidence of vasospasm stimulated oxygen consumption to 0.91 +/- 0.17 (microM O2/min/g dry wt, +/- SD p &lt; or = 0.01) and CSF from SAH patients without vasospasm did not significantly stimulate oxygen consumption 0.27 +/- 0.02, with 0.23 +/- 0.03 (microM O2/min/g dry wt) being an unstimulated rate of respiration for the porcine carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> or dobutamine significantly (p &lt; or = 0.01) decreased the stimulation of oxygen consumption of the porcine carotid artery whereas nimodipine did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 41 SAH patients who received nimodipine alone or nimodipine and dobutamine, the in hospital mortality rate of the patients who received only nimodipine was 42% as compared to an in hospital mortality rate of 17% in the nimodipine plus dobutamine group P &lt; or = 0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The in vivo data on the 41 patients is not statistically significant, so further studies are required to determine if the differences are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> and dobutamine significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005290'>decreased oxygen consumption</z:mp> of the porcine carotid arteries exposed to CSF from SAH patients who had vasospasm whereas nimodipine did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro results suggest that these compounds require further study in patients with SAH who are at risk for vasospasm because they may have a direct benefit for the vasospastic arteries </plain></SENT>
