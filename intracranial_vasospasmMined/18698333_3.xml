<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study's hypothesis is that cisternal cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from patients after SAH may cause Ca(2+) oscillations which induce these modes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> in an in vitro model of human cerebral endothelial cells (HCECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HCECs were incubated with cisternal CSF from 10 SAH patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF was collected on days 5 and 6 after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and cell contraction as an indicator of endothelial barrier function were examined by fura-2 microflurometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of NF-kappaB and VCAM-1 expression were measured by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of HCEC with SAH-CSF provoked cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations (0.31+/-0.09 per min), cell contraction, NF-kappaB activation, and VCAM-1 expression, whereas exposure to native CSF had no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase and ER <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> trisphosphate (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>)-sensitive Ca(2+) channels were blocked by thapsigargin or xestospongin, the frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations was reduced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In analogy to the reduction of Ca(2+) oscillation frequency, the blockers impaired HCEC contraction, NF-kappaB activation, and VCAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cisternal SAH-CSF induces cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations in HCEC that results in cellular constriction, NF-kappaB activation, and VCAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Ca(2+) oscillations depend on the function of ER Ca(2+)-ATPase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16595">IP3</z:chebi>-sensitive Ca(2+) channels </plain></SENT>
