<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microcirculatory changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) are still controversial and uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of cerebral microcirculation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to clarify the roles of microcirculatory disturbances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by measuring cerebral circulation time (CCT) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 cases with aneurysmal SAH, rCBF studies by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were performed on the same day between 5 and 7 days after SAH and/or within 4 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of delayed ischemic neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCT was obtained by analyzing the time-density curve of the contrast media on DSA images and was divided into proximal CCT, which was the circulation time through the extraparenchymal large arteries, and peripheral CCT, which was the circulation time through the intraparenchymal small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed in association with rCBF and angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe angiographic vasospasm statistically decreased rCBF, and correlation between the degree of angiographic vasospasm and rCBF was seen (r=0.429, P=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral CCT showed strong inverse correlation with rCBF (r=-0.767, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even in none/mild or moderate angiographic vasospasm, prolonged peripheral CCT was clearly associated with decreased rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the marked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing of large arteries detected as severe angiographic vasospasm, microcirculatory changes detected as prolonged peripheral CCT affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that impaired autoregulatory vasodilation or decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> caliber in intraparenchymal vessels may take part in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
