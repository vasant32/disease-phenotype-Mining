<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received three cisterna magna injections of fresh unheparinized autologous arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective left vertebral arteriograms were obtained during the week before and exactly 7 days after the initial subarachnoid injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasing volumes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (from 9 to 15 ml of blood) delivered over 24 hours produced increasingly more severe arterial spasm, with reductions in basilar artery diameter of 37% +/- 14 (SD) and 58% +/- 15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delay of the final injection of blood to 96 hours in the 15-ml <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group resulted in even more intense spasm, with an average 71% +/- 12 reduction in basilar artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial angiographic evaluation demonstrated the resolution of spasm in this group over approximately 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, small, late rebleeding episodes resulted in the rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of intense spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results support the clinical impression of previous studies that the severity of spasm is related to the volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and, in addition, suggest that the time course of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> may play a significant role in determining the overall severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
