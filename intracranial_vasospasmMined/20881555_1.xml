<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SAH increases with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether age is an independent predictor of angiographic vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs), or abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from CONSCIOUS-1 (Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> Occurring After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</z:hpo> study), a dose-finding study of clazosentan, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities were prospectively recorded as well as baseline characteristics and treatment data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient age was considered in 3 ways: as a continuous variable, dichotomized at age 65 years, and categorized by decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age was investigated as the main variable, whereas other possible confounding variables were adjusted for in the multiple logistic regression modeling with each of 3 dichotomized vasospasm outcome measures, presence or absence of angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities as the dependent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of patients with angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities were 45%, 19%, and 81%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, whether considered as a continuous, dichotomous, or a categorical variable, was not significantly associated with angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, or abnormal TCD measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age does not seem to be a significant predictor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
