<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomized open trial with nimodipine as the control included 72 patients who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> of Hunt and Hess grades I to IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 14 days following surgery, patients were administered either 30 mg of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> by intravenous injection over a period of 30 minutes three times a day or 1 mg/hr of nimodipine by continuous intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both drugs significantly improved consciousness levels and neurological deficits such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> improved motor disturbance more than nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions occurred in 13 of 37 patients receiving fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> and 15 of 35 patients receiving nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events in the fasudil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this clinical trial indicate that fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> is a safe and efficient agent for suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
