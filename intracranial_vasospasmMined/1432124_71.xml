<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven vascular territories in 10 patients with symptomatic vasospasm were treated according to the following protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in two steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon was used for dilation of the internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> leak balloon or Tracker-18 catheter was then introduced into or just proximal to the site of vasospasm not accessible to the angioplasty balloon catheter for superselective infusion of 0.2% papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of 37 vascular territories were successfully dilated, and eight of 10 patients showed improvement in neurological function after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no serious side effects due to infusion of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is essential to infuse the papaverine just proximal to the spastic vessels in order to deliver sufficient concentration of drug, and infusion should be carried out as early as possible before the artery loses its ability to return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Superselective intraarterial infusion of papaverine is an alternative method of treatment for symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
