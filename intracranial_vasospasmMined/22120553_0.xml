<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Colforsin</z:chebi> daropate <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (CDH) has also recently been reported to be useful for reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the impacts of intraarterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and CDH on the outcomes of SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of SAH patients were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight and 133 patients were included in the study during 1998-1999 (group A) and 2003-2005 (group B), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> or CDH was the only agent used for pharmacologic angioplasty in groups A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score ≤ 2 at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of patients without CV who had good outcomes were similar in groups A (78%) and B (81%, P = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage of patients with CV with a good outcome was significantly higher in group B (66%) than in group A (34%, P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression revealed that age ≤ 65 years (P = 0.0001), World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade ≤ 2 (P &lt; 0.0001), CV (P = 0.0001), and group B (P = 0.0069) were independent causative factors for good outcome in the overall patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age ≤ 65 (P = 0.0002) and WFNS grade ≤ 2 (P &lt; 0.0001) were independent causative factors for good outcome in patients without CV, whereas only group B (P = 0.0089) was an independent factor for good outcome in patients with CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CDH appears to be associated with a better outcome in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
