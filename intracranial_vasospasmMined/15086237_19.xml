<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Although abnormalities in the control of endothelial vasomotility have been reported in both experimental and clinical studies, the mechanism of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> that occurs following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the absence of previous in vivo studies of endothelial function in cerebral vessels in response to SAH or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the authors investigated endothelium-dependent responses in an established primate model of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was assessed by examining vascular responses to intracarotid injections of various drugs known to act via the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drugs that have a rapid total body clearance were selected so that their pharmacological effects would be limited to the cerebral circulation after an intracarotid infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen adult male cynomolgus monkeys were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular endothelium-dependent responses were examined in control animals and in animals with SAH 7, 14, and 21 days after placement of a subarachnoid clot around the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) were recorded continuously during 5-minute intracarotid infusions of 5% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> vehicle, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, bradykinin, or Calcimycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control animals the intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> produced a significant (7.8 +/- 9.5%) increase in CBF and a 9.3 +/- 8.7% reduction in CVR in comparison with a control infusion of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> disappeared in animals 7 days post-SAH, specifically in the subset of animals in which arteriography confirmed the presence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infusion of Calcimycin produced no significant changes in CBF or CVR in control animals, but resulted in a significant reduction in CBF and increase in CVR in animals 7 days after SAH and in animals with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An infusion of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> or bradykinin had no significant effect on CBF or CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An intracarotid infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, but not one of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, bradykinin, or Calcimycin, produced a measurable physiological response in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primate cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that occurred after SAH produced a pathophysiological effect similar to the endothelial denudation shown in the in vitro experiments of Furchgott and Zawadzki, in which <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> constricted the vessels via activation of receptors on smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Changes in vascular responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and Calcimycin in animals with vasospasm, compared with control animals, provide evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> plays a key role in the development and/or sustenance of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
