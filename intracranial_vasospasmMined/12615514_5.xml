<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was noticed that vasospastic CSF (CSF(V)) could be formed in vitro by the mixing of control blood (with platelets) and non-SAH CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also propose a hypothesis for the aetiology of CV after SAH based on this and previous research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study also aims to determine which blood fraction is responsible for the stimulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> consumption and vasospasm of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control blood was separated into various fractions and mixed with non-SAH CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of the resulting mixture and the blood fraction alone were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the fractions containing platelets mixed with CSF showed vasoactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that platelets plus some component in the CSF produce vasoactive factors with actions similar to CSF(V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study may help to elucidate the aetiology of CV after SAH </plain></SENT>
