<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated mechanisms of possible antivasospastic effects of N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi>-oxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), a caspase inhibitor that can inhibit both inflammatory and apoptotic systems, in animal models of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits were assigned to three groups of eight animals each and were subjected to SAH by injection of blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed in the following groups: SA only, SAH + vehicle, and SAH + Z-VAD-FMK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Z-VAD-FMK (1 mg) or vehicle (5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>) was intrathecally administered before SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diameters of the basilar artery (BA) were measured on angiograms obtained before and 2 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BA diameter on Day 2 was expressed as a percentage of that before SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was examined using Western blotting, and brains were immunohistochemically examined for caspase-1 and IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, 20 rats were subjected to SAH and their brains were immunohistochemically assessed for caspase-1, IL-1beta, and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In rabbits, Z-VAD-FMK significantly attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (the BA diameter on Day 2 in SAH-only, SAH + vehicle, and SAH + Z-VAD-FMK groups was 66.6 +/- 3.2%, 66.3 +/- 3.7%, and 82.6 +/- 4.9% of baseline, respectively), and suppressed IL-1beta release into the CSF and also suppressed immunoreactivities of caspase-1 and IL-1P in macrophages infiltrating into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivities for caspase-1 and IL-1P were observed in immunohistochemically proven infiltrating macrophages in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that caspase activation may be involved in the development of SAH-induced vasospasm through inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
