<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed rectifier and calcium-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents were identified from the whole-cell recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only the calcium-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current was increased by cromakalim and pinacidil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recordings from inside-out membrane patches revealed a large conductance voltage- and calcium-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel, which was blocked by charybdotoxin but unaffected by ATP less than 10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cromakalim and pinacidil increased the open probability of this channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, we suggest that such drugs, acting on cerebral arterial smooth muscle cell <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels, may be of some benefit in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
