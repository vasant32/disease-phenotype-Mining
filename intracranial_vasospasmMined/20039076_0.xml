<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The amount of blood on computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be a predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of the location of the blood on the incidence of vasospasm remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively assessed the association of the blood volumes in the individual components (cisterns and fissures) of CT scans with angiographic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-nine SAH patients scheduled for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of subarachnoid blood was classified using the Fisher CT grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amounts of subarachnoid blood in 5 cisterns or 3 fissures were also evaluated using SAH scores ranging from 0 to 3 (0, no blood; 3, completely filled with blood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was diagnosed by the results of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic vasospasm developed in 51 of 149 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those, 26 patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Fisher CT grade and SAH scores in the right and left sylvian fissures and suprasellar cisterns were significantly higher in patients with angiographic vasospasm than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a high Fisher CT grade and high SAH scores in the right and left sylvian fissures and suprasellar cisterns were predictors of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that the SAH score in the right sylvian fissure was an independent predictor of angiographic vasospasm (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-7.7; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the amount of blood in the right sylvian fissure was significantly associated with the development of angiographic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
