<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> was found to result in a reduction in resting CBF of about 25% but the reactivity of the cerebrovascular circulation to carbon dioxide was preserved at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusions of epoprostenol (prostacyclin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) at a dose of 5 ng/kg/min resulted in a reduction of CBF of about 10% after placebo but no significant change in CBF after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
