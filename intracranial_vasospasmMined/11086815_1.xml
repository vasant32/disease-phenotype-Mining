<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excitatory <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> are gathered in the extracellular space during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and initiate or stimulate a series of pathophysiological biochemical processes which consequently lead to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tizanidine (Sandoz compound DS 103-282, 5-chloro-4,2 (2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino)-2,1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45993">benzothiazol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>) is a centrally-acting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="51371">muscle relaxant</z:chebi> and a selective alpha 2 adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> which shows its effect by stimulating presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors in central ASPergic and GLUergic system by inhibiting aspartic acid and glutamic acid release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of Tizanidine on vasospasm was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a femoral artery vasospasm model in rats which has been described by Okada et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>60 rats were examined in three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first group was used as control group (Control) (n = 20), in the second group <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was performed (SAH) (n = 20), in the third group Tizanidine was administered in addition to SAH (SAH + Tizanidine administration) (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals in SAH + Tizanidine administration group received 0.3 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the experiment, after perfusion-fixation, 10 mm segments of both femoral arteries were removed and the femoral artery was prepared for light microscope examination, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and for morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the electron, scanning and light microscopic observations and morphometric analysis of SAH + Tizanidine administration group and SAH group, and no statistically significant difference between SAH + Tizanidine administration group and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has disclosed that Tizanidine administration before the vasospasm reduces ultrastructural and morphometric vasospastic insult significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical application of Tizanidine as a protective and therapeutic agent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> needs further studies including the employment of clinically more relevant SAH models </plain></SENT>
