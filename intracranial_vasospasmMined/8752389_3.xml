<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> is associated with the reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the question of whether the reduction of rCBF during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura is caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or is secondary to the neural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) is still disputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured rCBF by high resolution SPECT method during the attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and examined whether the reduction in flow corresponds to the cerebral vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (7 men and 7 women, 34.7 +/- 17.8 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients rCBF was measured during the interictal period and in four patients rCBF was measured during the aura of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT measurements of rCBF was performed using Tc-99m-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> (740 MBq) as a tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the aura of scintillation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo> in the unilateral visual field rCBF was reduced in the opposite occipital, temporal and thalamic regions which corresponded clearly to the region of the posterior cerebral arterial territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction of rCBF was by 31 approximately 49% compared with the opposite hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral spinal fluid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> measured in one patient was higher (38 mg/dl) than the interictal period (12 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that the reduction of rCBF during the aura is caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> probably due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and is not secondary to the neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that the primary site of rCBF reduction during the visual aura is the occipital association cortex which is reported to be responsible for the visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
