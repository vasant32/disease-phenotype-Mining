<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and tolerability of super-selective intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> in combination with intra-arterial nicardipine in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were treated in a prospective protocol at two teaching medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emergent cerebral angiography was performed if there was either clinical, ultrasound, and/or computed tomographic (CT) perfusion deficits suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> (0.25-1 g) was administered via a microcatheter in the affected vessels in combination with nicardipine (2.5-20.0 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressures (MAP) and intracranial pressures (ICP) were monitored during the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate and sustained angiographic and clinical improvement was determined from post-treatment angiograms and clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic and clinical outcomes were compared to two published case series that has used nicardipine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 58 vessels were treated in 14 patients (mean age 42 years; 11 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment was either intra-arterial nicardipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> alone or in conjunction with primary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty vessels (69%) had immediate angiographic improvement with intra-arterial nicardipine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> alone and 18 vessels (31%) required concomitant balloon angioplasty with complete reversal of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Retreatment was required in 13 vessels (22%) and the median time for retreatment was 2 days (range 1-13 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine treatment resulted in the reduction of MAP (12.3 mmHg, standard error [SE] 1.34, P-value &lt;0.0001) without any significant change in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> infusion was not associated with change in MAP or ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among 31 procedures, immediate neurological improvement was observed in 22 (71%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 12 (86%) patients, there were no infarctions in the follow-up CT scan acquired between 24 and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No statistical significant difference was observed in angiographic and clinical outcome of patients treated with the combination therapy in comparison with historical controls treated with nicardipine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> without a significant change in MAP and ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of this combination therapy should be evaluated in a larger, controlled setting </plain></SENT>
