<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathological mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> has not been well clarified until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been reports that denervation supersensitivity in cerebral vessels occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> may possible play a role in the appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we have accepted that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (Oxy-Hb) is an important spasmogenic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of chemical denervation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> or 6-hydroxydopamine: 6-OHDA) and surgical denervation (bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy: SCG) on the constrictive sensitivity of cat basilar arteries to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (Nor) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (Oxy-Hb) in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Adult cats were anesthetized with intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and maintained on a respirator through a tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the transclival approach, the basilar artery was exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cannula was then inserted into the subarachnoid space, and through it, Oxy-Hb and Nor were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sequential changes in caliber of the basilar artery were measured using photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCG was done 7 days before the application of Nor or Oxy-Hb and 14 days before application of Oxy-Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> was done as follows: 1 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> was injected subcutaneously once each day for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the following day, the sensitivity of the basilar arteries to Nor or Oxy-Hb was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 6-OHDA was done as follows: 5 mg of 6-OHDA was dissolved in 1.0 ml of artificial CSF, and then injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, Nor or Oxy-Hb was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> tended to increase the vasoconstriction induced by 10(-7)-10(-4) M of Nor and the constriction induced by 10(-3) M of Nor was increased statistically (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cisterna magna injection of 6-OHDA tended to increase the vasoconstriction induced by Nor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SGG tended to increase the vasoconstriction induced by 10(-7)-10(-4) M of Nor and at a dose of 10(-3) M of Nor, the constriction of the basilar arteries was increased statistically (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi>, 6-OHDA and SCG did not increase the vasoconstriction induced by Oxy-Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These results lead us to suggest that denervation supersensitivity does not participate in the vasoconstriction induced by Oxy-Hb </plain></SENT>
