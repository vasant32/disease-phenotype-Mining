<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of U88999E on basilar artery tone were examined in two model systems: 1) an in vitro preparation of arterial rings that measures isometric tension, and 2) an in vivo model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> measuring arterial diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U88999E elicited dose-dependent relaxation of preconstricted arterial rings maintained in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ring preparations were preconstricted using elevated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (40 mmol/L), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (10(-3) mol/L), or endothelin-1 (10(-8) mol/L); U88999E reversed these constrictions across a concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potency of U88999E for relaxing preconstricted vessels was slightly less than that observed for flunarizine or diltiazem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent, relaxing effect of U88999E on <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-induced contractions was observed in the presence of calcium concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 20 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm of basilar arteries after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was inhibited in a dose-dependent and significant manner by intravenous injections of U88999E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving intraperitoneal injections of U88999E also exhibited a tendency for reduced vasospasm; however, this effect did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that U88999E may be useful in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
