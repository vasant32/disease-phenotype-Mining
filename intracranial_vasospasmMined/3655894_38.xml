<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to one of five groups: sham-operated group, clot removal at 48 hours after SAH (48-hour group), clot removal at 72 hours after SAH (72-hour group), clot removal at 96 hours after SAH (96-hour group), and clot placement only (clot group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard microsurgical techniques were used to dissect bilaterally the major cerebral arteries free of arachnoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An autologous blood clot averaging 4.2 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid space of the monkeys in the 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour, and clot groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiological saline was instilled into the subarachnoid space of the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals in the clot-removal groups underwent surgical clot removal at the determined times for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two animals in each of the sham-operated and clot groups were subjected to reoperation at each of 48, 72, and 96 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incisions were reopened and then simply reclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and physiological status were evaluated before and 7 days after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant neurological deficits in the sham-operated, 48-hour, or 72-hour groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two animals in each of the 96-hour and clot groups showed deterioration in level of consciousness developing on Day 4 or 5 after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the major cerebral arteries of the animals in the clot and 96-hour groups showed significant vasospasm (p less than 0.01) on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Animals in the 72-hour group had significant vasospasm (p less than 0.05) of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries but not the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant vasospasm (p greater than 0.05) in any of the cerebral arteries in the 48-hour group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Severity of vasospasm paralleled the duration of contact between the blood clot and the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Evacuation of the subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> later than 48 hours after SAH resulted in no significant reduction in the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that clot removal at early operation is likely to be useful only if it is performed within 48 hours of SAH </plain></SENT>
