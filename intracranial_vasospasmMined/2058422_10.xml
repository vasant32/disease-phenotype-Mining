<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of 126 patients with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> seen over a 10 year period was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They had a total of 302 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent of the patients were males, and 63% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct operations were performed on 97 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in 71% (69 of the 97 cases), and only the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in 29% (28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 69 cases in whom both ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated, one-stage operations were used for 48 cases, and two-stage operations were used for 21 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of the 48 cases, who were treated in one-stage operations, were operated on by day 4 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases, a total of 13 small unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which had not been found by preoperative angiograms, were discovered during surgery, and 9 of the 13 were discovered while removing blood clots to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the operative method selected and the timing of operations, the surgical outcome of patients with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was comparable to that of the 228 cases with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated during the same period at the same hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis of this study suggest that surgical results for multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are satisfactory, even for early operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, the actual incidence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be higher than has been reported to date because small unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which have been discovered during clot removal may not have been reported </plain></SENT>
