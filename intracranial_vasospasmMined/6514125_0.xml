<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy of slow-release, and prolonged diffusion <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> pellets mixed with papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition the diffusion of the other vasodilating agents (diltiazem and nicardipine) into the saline solution using the same <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> materials was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> was either packed in <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes (packed type) or polymerized with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomer, Silastic MDX-4-4210 (solid type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The solid type pellet is cylindrical-(diameter 3 mm, length 30 mm) and contains 40 w/v% of pure powder of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of the delivered drug was measured for 5 weeks at 37 degrees C and at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diffusion rate of the solid type pellet was about 5 times higher than that of the packed one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diffusion rates of both types of pellets were about 10 times higher at 37 degrees C than at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cummulative amount of the delivered drug from the solid type pellet was 37.1% of the initial packed volume at 37 degrees C in the first 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diffusion of diltiazem and nicardipine which were polymerized 30 w/v% in <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> elastomer was observed for 3 weeks at 37 degrees C only in solid type pellet form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diffusion rate was measured under the condition of either continuous <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> or standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed the same diffusion rates for diltiazem and nicardipine, with no difference in diffusion rate between the "<z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp>" and "standing" groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diffusion rate showed inverse exponential curves, and was 5-20 X 10(-5)/day/mm2 of initial volume until 5 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
