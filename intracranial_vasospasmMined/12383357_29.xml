<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral vasculature, endothelial damage increases intimal matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, causing neointimal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) (a marker of endothelial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), MMP-9, and VEGF levels could serve as prognostic markers in predicting the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Venous serum vWF, MMP-9, and VEGF levels were prospectively measured daily, for 12 days or until the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm, for 45 consecutive patients admitted with SAH (n = 38) or admitted for elective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping (control subjects, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of transcranial Doppler flow velocities of more than 180 cm/s and/or new focal neurological deficits with angiographically confirmed vasospasm was considered the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To establish whether these markers were specific for vasospasm versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, blood samples were obtained from a concurrent group of 42 patients within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> unrelated to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of patients (22 of 38 patients) developed vasospasm, 4 to 11 days after SAH (median, 7 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean peak serum vWF, MMP-9, and VEGF levels were increased in the SAH prevasospasm cohort, compared with the SAH nonvasospasm cohort (vWF, 5526 +/- 929 versus 4934 +/- 599 ng/ml, P = 0.01; MMP-9, 705 +/- 338 versus 438 +/- 154 ng/ml, P = 0.006; VEGF, 0.12 +/- 0.06 versus 0.06 +/- 0.06 ng/ml, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean peak vWF, MMP-9, and VEGF levels for the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> cohort (vWF, 4645 +/- 875 ng/ml, P = 0.01; MMP-9, 250 +/- 308 ng/ml, P = 0.001; VEGF, 0.03 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, P = 0.001) were markedly lower in comparison with the SAH prevasospasm cohort and were unchanged in comparison with the control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>vWF levels of more than 5500 ng/ml, VEGF levels of more than 0.12 ng/ml, and MMP levels of more than 700 ng/ml each independently increased the odds of subsequent vasospasm (18-, 20-, and 25-fold, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH was preceded by increases in serum vWF, MMP-9, and VEGF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased serum vWF, MMP-9, and VEGF levels could accurately predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These factors were not elevated by SAH alone or in a separate cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting that these factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
