<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the cumulative incidence, duration, and time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a cohort of 299 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography studies of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral and basilar arteries (VMCA and VBA, respectively) were performed at regular intervals during the first 2 weeks posttrauma in association with 133Xe cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to current definitions of vasospasm, five different criteria were used to classify the patients: A (VMCA &gt; 120 cm/second); B (VMCA &gt; 120 cm/second and a Lindegaard ratio [LR] &gt; 3); C (spasm index [SI] in the anterior circulation &gt; 3.4); D (VBA &gt; 90 cm/second); and E (SI in the posterior circulation &gt; 2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria C and E were considered to represent hemodynamically significant vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed-effects spline models were used to analyze the data of multiple measurements with an inconsistent sampling rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 45.2% of the patients demonstrated at least one criterion for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients in whom vasospasm developed were significantly younger and had lower Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The normalized cumulative incidences were 36.9 and 36.2% for patients with Criteria A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically significant vasospasm in the anterior circulation (Criterion C) was found in 44.6% of the patients, whereas vasospasm in the BA-Criterion D or E-was found in only 19 and 22.5% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for Criteria A, B, D, and E was postinjury Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest risk of developing hemodynamically significant vasospasm in the anterior circulation was found on Day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The daily prevalence of vasospasm in patients in the intensive care unit was 30% from postinjury Day 2 to Day 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm resolved after a duration of 5 days in 50% of the patients with Criterion A or B and after a period of 3.5 days in 50% of those patients with Criterion D or E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically significant vasospasm in the anterior circulation resolved after 2.5 days in 50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The time course of that vasospasm was primarily determined by a decrease in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of vasospasm after TBI is similar to that following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Because vasospasm is a significant event in a high proportion of patients after severe head injury, close TCD and CBF monitoring is recommended for the treatment of such patients </plain></SENT>
