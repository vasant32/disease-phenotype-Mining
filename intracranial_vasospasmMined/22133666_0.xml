<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alteration of vasomotor tone has been postulated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family and their receptors have been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum levels of soluble endoglin (sEng) and plasma levels of TGF-β(1) of 20 consecutive SAH patients were analyzed within 15 days after SAH using ELISA and correlated with CVS, CIV and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty voluntary age- and sex-matched blood donors served as healthy controls (HCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAH patients showed significantly lower sEng serum levels and higher TGF-β(1) plasma levels compared to HCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed Doppler sonographic CVS (dCVS) had significantly higher TGF-β(1) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with CIV and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> showed significantly lower sEng levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 3, pSAH sEng levels below 3.88 ng/ml or TGF-β(1) levels higher than 7.2 ng/ml had a predictive value for the development of CIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low mean sEng levels over the study period were highly predictive of poor long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥2) at 6 months after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of the vasoactive factors sEng in serum and TGF-β(1) in plasma are significantly altered in SAH patients compared to HCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this pilot study indicate that sEng could represent a novel prognostic biomarker for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of secondary complications and long-term functional outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
