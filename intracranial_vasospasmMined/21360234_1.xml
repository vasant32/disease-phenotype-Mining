<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While angiographic improvement is consistently reported, clinical improvement following the procedure varies, and limited data is available regarding overall impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospital admissions with aneurysmal SAH over a 6 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The length of stay, discharge outcomes (measured by modified Rankin scale [mRS] at discharge), and 1-year mortality among patients with SAH before (4 year period) and after (2 year period) institution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> was used as a therapeutic option throughout the study duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of institution of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for vasospasm after adjusting for age, clinical severity, and use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization on both discharge outcomes and 1-year mortality in multivariate analysis was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 146 patients with aneurysmal SAH were admitted during the study duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the 89 patients admitted in pre-angioplasty period and 57 patients admitted in post-angioplasty period in regards to age, medical co-morbidities, and admission clinical severity of patients (measured by Hunt and Hess grade and Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 (32%) patients underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with or without intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> treatment in the second period of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a non significant decrease in rates of severe disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (mRS 5-6) at discharge (45 vs. 33%, P = 0.09) and 1-year mortality (32 vs. 22%, P = 0.26) after introduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two time periods in regards to length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A non significant trend was noted with reduced rate of severe disability and mortality at discharge and 1-year mortality after the introduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with SAH without increasing the length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
