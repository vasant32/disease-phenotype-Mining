<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The membrane systems of both the cell surface and internal organs, seem to be responsible for controlling the myoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, typified by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, has been postulated to be a blockade of transmembrane calcium influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the vasodilating effect of diltiazem on experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in vivo was examined using dogs and was compared with those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> which have already been reported by us </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasms</z:e> were induced in adult dogs by injecting 5 ml of fresh arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10(-6)M diltiazem was injected by one shot into the vertebral artery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the cerebral arteries were monitored by angiography after administration of diltiazem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, intracranial pressure and pulse rate were measured during intravenous application of the drug in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of diltiazem released the vasospasm for 30 minutes comparable to the times of the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem had cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> actions similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> at doses that did not decrease systemic blood pressure, while the other drugs decreased intracranial pressure slightly and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> decreased pulse rate slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we consider diltiazem to be satisfactory for the treatment of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
