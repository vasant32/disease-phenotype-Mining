<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 46-year-old woman with a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032587" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyradiculoneuropathy</z:e> treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> with increased blood flow velocities of the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The similitude between this observation and another case recently reported of a patient suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</z:e> (GBS) and cerebral blood flow abnormalities after IVIg treatment prompted us to investigate the responsibility of the IVIg therapy in the genesis of these blood flow alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied therefore by TCD 10 consecutive patients who underwent this treatment for different reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1 case we observed an asymptomatic, spontaneously reversible increase in the blood flow velocities of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> consistent with a vasospasm and occurring 3-10 days after completion of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> have been reported as possible complications of IVIg treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case under discussion, clinical events appeared shortly after the administration of the IVIg therapy and responded favorably to a treatment with nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other etiopathogenic mechanisms, in particular a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> vasculopathic process related to the GBS itself, have to be considered as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies, with a larger number of patients, are therefore needed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of blood flow abnormalities occurring sometimes in GBS patients after IVIg treatment </plain></SENT>
