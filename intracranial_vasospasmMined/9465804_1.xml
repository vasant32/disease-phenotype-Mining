<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effect of contractions and second-stage pushing on cerebral blood flow velocity as an indirect assessment of cerebral hemodynamic changes during labor and delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort of 15 normotensive patients in early labor had maternal middle cerebral blood flow velocity assessed continuously with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment was performed during the peak of a contraction, during the trough of a contraction, and with pushing in the second stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed systolic, diastolic, mean cerebral blood flow velocity (in centimeters per second), and pulsatility index over four contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used analysis of variance to compare velocities at these three stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean maternal cerebral blood flow velocity fell significantly (61.2 +/- 6.4, 50 +/- 10.2, 52.2 +/- 6.5 cm/sec) (p &lt; 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate rose significantly by 16 beats/min (p &lt; 0.0001), but no significant change in blood pressure occurred in patients during second-stage labor when pushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Middle cerebral vessels vasodilated during the peak of contractions and second-stage pushing as assessed by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pushing in the second stage with the Valsalva maneuver does not expose the patient to a greater risk for middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> than contractions developing in the first stage </plain></SENT>
