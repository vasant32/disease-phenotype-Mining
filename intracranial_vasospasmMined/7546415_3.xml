<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report the occurrence of a syndrome of recurrent neurological deficits in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> and to discuss its management and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A regional treatment centre for HIV-infected individuals in northwest England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Transient neurological deficit was defined as a focal neurological deficit of rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> which resolved completely within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequency, character and duration of episodes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior illnesses, CD4 count, changes in drug therapy and brain imaging investigations were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven cases with recurrent transient neurological deficits were identified among 748 patients over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six had a CD4 cell count &lt; 50 x 10(6)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The episodes lasted between 1 and 12 h and resolved completely without lasting sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>Dysphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were the most common presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent episodes for each patient tended to follow a similar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None had computed tomographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or clinical evidence of completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was varied and not evidently altered by the episodes of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients may have benefited from treatment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> prophylactics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A syndrome of recurrent transient neurological deficits may occur in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We believe that in some cases this may be due to local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, comparable to a classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura </plain></SENT>
