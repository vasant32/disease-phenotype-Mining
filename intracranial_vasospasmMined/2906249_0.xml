<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of phenoxybenzamine <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (POB) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8365">prazosin hydrochloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi>) on the cerebral vasoconstriction in the basilar arteries of cats induced by application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (Oxy-Hb), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (Nor) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult cats were anesthetized with intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and maintained on a respirator through a tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By the transclival approach, a bone window was formed in the clivus, and the dura was opened, exposing the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cannule was inserted into the subarachnoid space, and through it, Oxy-Hb, Nor and PGF2 alpha were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequential changes in caliber of the basilar artery were measured using photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, we determined the doses of POB and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> necessary for decreasing the vasoconstriction induced by Nor, and 20 mg/kg of POB and 10 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> were found to decrease the vasoconstriction induced by 10(-3) M Nor, statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, we investigated the effect of 20 mg/kg of POB and 0.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> on the cerebral vasoconstriction induced by Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>POB (20 mg/kg) was infused for 2 hours before the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> was given intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first group, 0.02% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for 1.5 hours before the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the second group, 1.5 hours elapsed between the beginning of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> (10mg/kg) infusion and the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
