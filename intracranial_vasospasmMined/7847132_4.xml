<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with SAH due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF concentration, PAF-acetylhydrolase activity, platelet count and aggregability, and plasma factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) concentrations were measured regularly until approximately 2 weeks after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPLs, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> IgG and IgM were measured within 3 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF concentration in patients with SAH showed the highest value on the occasion during 5 to 9 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations were higher in patients with infarction due to vasospasm than in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on any occasions after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activities did not change in patients, regardless of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased platelet consumption and aggregability and higher concentrations of PF 4 were detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and not in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> had aPLs more frequently than the control volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that increased plasma PAF and aPLs may contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
