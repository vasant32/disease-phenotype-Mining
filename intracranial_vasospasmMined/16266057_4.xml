<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an in vitro experiment involving human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the authors examined mechanisms potentially responsible for increased ADMA levels during vasospasm and investigated whether this increase can be inhibited pharmacologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a second study, an in vivo experiment, the authors used probucol, which effectively inhibited ADMA increase in HUVEC cultures in vitro, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiment in a primate model of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidized low-density <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (OxLDLs; positive control; p &lt; 0.02) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products (BOXes; p &lt; 0.01), but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = 0.74), increased ADMA levels in HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probucol inhibited changes in ADMA levels evoked by either OxLDLs (p &lt; 0.001) or BOXes (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparable changes were observed in cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo probucol (100 mg/kg by mouth daily) did not alter serum ADMA levels on Days 7, 14, and 21 after SAH compared with levels before SAH, and these levels were not different from those observed in the placebo group (p = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite achieving therapeutic levels in plasma and measurable levels in CSF, probucol neither prevented increased CSF ADMA levels nor the development of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased CSF ADMA and decreased <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels in both groups were strongly associated with the degree of delayed vasospasm after SAH (correlation coefficient [CC] 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.72, p &lt; 0.002 and CC -0.43, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.05, p &lt; 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, increased ADMA levels in the HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite its in vitro ability to lower ADMA levels, probucol failed to inhibit increased CSF ADMA and decreased <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels, and it did not prevent delayed vasospasm in a primate SAH model </plain></SENT>
