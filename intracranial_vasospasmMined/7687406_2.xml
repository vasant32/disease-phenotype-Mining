<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The late spasm is associated with a generalized reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) of about 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal administration of the substance P (SP) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> spantide two hours and three days post SAH significantly reduces the degree of late spasm and also decreases the degree of CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that SP is involved in the development of both angiographical spasm and CBF changes post SAH </plain></SENT>
