<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) is an intrinsic vasodilatory substance contained in perivascular nerve fibers of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that CGRP plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An experimental SAH was produced by intracisternal injection of arterial blood in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated with intrathecal administration of CGRP solution 3 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm and the effect of CGRP were evaluated angiographically by measuring the basilar artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basilar artery constricted to 73.0% of the pre-SAH values 3 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after injection of 10(-10) mol/kg CGRP, the basilar artery dilated to 117.1% (n = 8), which was significantly larger than 67.1% in the vehicle group (n = 8) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant vasodilatory effect of CGRP, compared with the vehicle group, lasted for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal administration of CGRP has therapeutic potential for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
