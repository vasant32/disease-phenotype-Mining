<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate whether the intraparenchymal and extraparenchymal portions of small cerebral arteries show different histopathological changes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced in dogs by a two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method, and the dogs were perfusion-fixed at 7 and 14 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> untreated animals were also examined to determine whether or not the histological and morphological changes in the perforating arteries were affected by the perfusion pressure during perfusion-fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control dogs, which received cisternal injection of saline, and untreated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs, which were divided into two groups depending on the perfusion pressure during perfusion-fixation, were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microvascular corrosion casts produced by arterial injection of polyester resin were examined by scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) with morphometric analysis of the caliber of the small perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slices sectioned parallel to the pontine surface were examined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> and by light microscopy with morphometric analysis of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter and wall thickness of the small perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corrosion casts showed irregular width with folds in the perforating arteries 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sectioned slices showed an increased wall thickness of the perforating arteries with intimal corrugation 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis revealed that the extraparenchymal portion of the perforating arteries showed no significant differences between any of the groups tested; however, the intraparenchymal portion showed a significant decrease of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter 7 days after SAH, and a significant increase of wall thickness 7 and 14 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The perfusion pressure during perfusion-fixation did not affect the histological changes in the perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that the vasoconstrictive response of the perforating arteries to SAH was different between the extraparenchymal and the intraparenchymal portion, and showed that the intraparenchymal portion of the perforating arteries constrict after SAH, which may affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by increasing total cerebrovascular resistance </plain></SENT>
