<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient group observed here is a subset of patients enrolled in the multicenter North American Trial of Tirilazad in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were treated with intraarterial administration of papaverine (IAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were only treated with transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA), and 24 patients received a combination of angioplasty and papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of IAP and TBA on short-term clinical improvement of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daily clinical staging with the modified Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale and every-other-day transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements allowed for a close investigation of the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of treatment timing on short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although TCD studies demonstrated a decrease in flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery in both treatment groups, indicating a vasodilating effect of both treatment modalities (dv = -18.4 cm/second for papaverine, dv = -26.04 cm/second for angioplasty; p = 0.5509), there was no significant difference in clinical improvement at Days 1 and 4 postprocedure (p = 0.1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither of the two treatment forms showed an effect of therapy timing on neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither IAP nor TBA was correlated with a high percentage of short-term neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss reasons why those procedures may result in limited clinical change </plain></SENT>
