<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study on rats, the effects of four calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (diltiazem, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, and nimodipine) on isolated intracerebral penetrating arterioles with mean resting diameters (+/- standard error of the mean) of 52.3 +/- 3.0 micron were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameters were monitored in vitro by means of a video microscope dimensional analyzer under constant transmural pressure (60 mm Hg) after cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> produced maximal dilation of about 50% (diltiazem 46.4% +/- 5.6%, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> 53.1% +/- 6.0%, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> 46.9% +/- 6.1%, and nimodipine 47.1% +/- 5.4%) with varied sensitivity (median effective dose (ED50): diltiazem 1.52 X 10(-6) M, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> 1.08 X 10(-7) M, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> 8.65 X 10(-9) M, and nimodipine 1.62 X 10(-9) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dilation effects persisted for a significantly longer time after washout with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> such as diltiazem (15.5 +/- 1.8 minutes), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (19.0 +/- 3.9 minutes), and nimodipine (30.0 +/- 1.6 minutes) than after washout with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (8.5 +/- 1.0 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appeared that the magnitude of vasodilation was greater and the duration of dilation after washout longer in intracerebral penetrating arterioles than that reported for pial arterioles, although sensitivity to each calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> was quite similar to that reported for larger cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide a possible explanation for the apparent disparity between clinical efficacy and angiographically determined vessel diameter when patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are treated with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These agents may have a greater effect on intracerebral penetrating arterioles than on angiographically visible larger arteries </plain></SENT>
