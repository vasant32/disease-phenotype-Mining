<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with hemodilution, reducing blood viscosity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, increasing cardiac performance and distending the vasospastic artery, are clinically established methods to improve blood flow through the vasospastic arterial bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Eight patients with transcranial Doppler verified vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were investigated with global (two-dimensional (133)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>) and regional (three-dimensional (99 m)Tc-HMPAO) cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements, before and after 1/iso- and 2/hypervolemic hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematocrit was reduced to 0.28 from 0.36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>Hypervolemia</z:hpo> was achieved by increasing blood volume by 1100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Isovolemic hemodilution increased global cerebral blood flow from 52.25+/-10.12 to 58.56+/-11.73 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) (p&lt;0.05), but after hypervolemic hemodilution CBF returned to 51.38+/-11.34 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global cerebral delivery rate of oxygen (CDRO(2)) decreased from 7.94+/-1.92 to 6.98+/-1.66 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) (p&lt;0.001) during isovolemic hemodilution and remained reduced, 6.77+/-1.60 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) (p&lt;0.001), after the hypervolemic hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a test of the hemodilution effect on regional CDRO(2) an ischemic threshold was defined as the maximal amount of oxygen transported by a CBF of 10 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) at a Hb 140 g/l which corresponds to a CDRO(2) of 1.83 ml * 100 g(-1) * min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain volume with a CDRO(2) exceeding the ichemic threshold was 1300+/-236 ml before intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After isovolemic hemodilution the non-ischemic brain volume was reduced to 1206+/-341 (p&lt;0,003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After hypervolemic hemodilution the non-ischemic brain volume remained reduced at 1228+/-347 ml (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The present study of controlled isovolemic hemodilution demonstrated increased global CBF, but there was a pronounced reduction in oxygen delivery capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both CBF and CDRO(2) remained decreased during further hypervolemic hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hemodilution to hematocrit 0.28 is not beneficial for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
