<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000458'>anosmia</z:hpo> has mainly been reported after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied whether and how frequently patients with ACoA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> present with smell identification deficits in 2 treatment groups (endovascular and surgical treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of patients with SAH caused by ruptured ACoAs and who had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1 or 2, in comparison with a control group matched by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Olfactory function was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A marked olfactory impairment was observed in patients with ruptured ACoAs compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with ruptured ACoAs (44%) compared with 1 patient in the control group (3%) showed a smell identification deficit according to performance on the UPSIT (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups that underwent treatment presented with olfactory impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten (59%) of 17 patients who underwent aneurysmal clip placement versus 6 (28.5%) of 21 patients who underwent coil embolization scored below the 25th percentile on the UPSIT, and surgical patients also performed worse than endovascular patients (p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors observed a worse performance on the olfactory test in patients subjected to endovascular coil embolization when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (p = 0.037) or frontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> (p = 0.009) were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was not observed in patients who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Olfactory disorders</z:e> after SAH caused by rupture of the ACoA are very frequent and were present in both treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and frontal lobe lesions are related to worse performance on an olfactory test in patients undergoing endovascular coil embolization </plain></SENT>
