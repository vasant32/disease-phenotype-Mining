<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the relationship between post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (tSAH) and post-traumatic vasospasm, 63 patients with severe head injury (GCS 3-8) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients had cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> on the initial CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 25 of these (Group I) there were only <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp>, while 22 (Group II) also had tSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had daily measurements of blood flow velocity in the basal cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of vasospasm detected by TCD was significantly higher in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore there were significantly fewer good outcomes (GOS 1 and 2) in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the presence of subarachnoid blood in patients with severe head injury is associated with a risk of vasospasm, and with poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
