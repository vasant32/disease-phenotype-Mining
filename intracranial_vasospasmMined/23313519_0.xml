<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of arterial vasospasm following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is poorly understood and the contribution of endogenous neuropeptides has not been sufficiently elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we detected an excessive release of vasoconstrictive neuropeptide Y (NPY) in SAH patients and identified a significant correlation of NPY cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels with vasospasm-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the results of an experimental study on the possible role of the potent endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> calcitonin-gene related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve consecutive patients with SAH were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had severe arterial vasospasm, confirmed by transcranial doppler-sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, CSF was collected from day 1 to day 10 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of CGRP were determined in a competitive enzyme immunoassay and were correlated with the clinical course and hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 29 patients without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease served as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CGRP was significantly higher in SAH patients compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From day 1 to day 4, the CGRP levels in patients without vasospasm were significantly higher than the levels of CGRP in patients with vasospasm (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significantly increased levels of the CGRP during the first days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the SAH in the non-vasospasm group indicate a potential protective role of CGRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CGRP may alleviate arterial vasoconstriction and thus protect the brain from vasospasm and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
