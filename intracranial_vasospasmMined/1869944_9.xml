<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> dissection and clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This theory was tested in a primate model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the results reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clip on the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals 6 and 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation </plain></SENT>
