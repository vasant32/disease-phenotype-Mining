<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown what proportion of delayed arterial narrowing after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> depends on ongoing metabolic activity within arterial smooth muscle cells versus changes in the passive structural properties of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine this, vasospasm was induced by the double <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anterior spinal artery segments were harvested from control dogs and from dogs with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The segments were suspended in a force transducer and stretched to an optimal length for contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in tension between 37 and 0 degrees C was defined as the intrinsic tone, and the residual tension at 0 degrees C was defined as the passive tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The segments taken from dogs with vasospasm had increased intrinsic tone and passive tension (the differences were 3.8 kN/m2 [P &lt; 0.05] and 14.8 kN/m2 [P &lt; 0.025], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, the passive component accounted for 79.6% of the increased tension in vasospastic arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracellular calcium concentration was measured in these segments, using the luminescent calcium indicator, aequorin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasospastic segments had increased basal intracellular calcium concentration (398 versus 258 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In parallel experiments, control and vasospastic vessels were immediately excised when the animals were killed, and the vessels were quick-frozen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to measure percent myosin light chain phosphorylation, vasospastic vessels were found to have increased myosin light chain phosphorylation (37 versus 2%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased intracellular calcium concentration and increased percent myosin light chain phosphorylation in vasospastic segments implicate a role for the Ca(2+)-dependent pathway of smooth muscle cell contraction in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
