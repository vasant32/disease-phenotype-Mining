<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previously, we showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E(2)) treatment prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was designed to further delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying E(2)-induced inhibition of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) upregulation and relief of vasospasm caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model was induced by 2 autologous injections of blood into the cisterna magna of adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were then subcutaneously implanted of a Silastic tube containing corn oil with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16150">benzoate</z:chebi> and received daily intraperitoneal injections of various doses of ICI 182,780, a nonselective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, for 7 days after the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were then removed for protein extraction, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation, and gel mobility assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of iNOS, p65, and ER were examined by Western blot analysis, and that iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: E(2) prevented the SAH-induced vasospasm and increases of the levels of iNOS protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in basilar artery through an ER-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the SAH rat with E(2) did not affect the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB, but caused an increase of the association of p65/ER, and reversed the SAH-induced increase of the p65 binding on iNOS promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: E(2) inhibits the SAH-induced increase of iNOS by increasing the association of p65/ER, which in turn inhibits the binding of p65 to iNOS DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the potential applications of E(2) in the treatment of SAH patient </plain></SENT>
