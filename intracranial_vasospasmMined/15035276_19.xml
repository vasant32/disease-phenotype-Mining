<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of single papaverine treatments on cerebral circulation time are well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of multiple, repeated papaverine infusions on the cerebral circulation time in patients with recurrent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 17 patients who received multiple intraarterial papaverine infusions in 91 carotid artery (CA) territories for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral circulation times were measured from the first angiographic image, in which peak contrast was seen above the supraclinoid internal CA, to the peak filling of cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores assessed 12 months after discharge were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral circulation times in 16 CA territories were measured in a control group of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients received a total of 91 papaverine treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged cerebral circulation times improved after 90 (99%) of 91 papaverine treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prepapaverine mean cerebral circulation time was 6.54 seconds (range 3.35-27 seconds) and the immediate postpapaverine mean cerebral circulation time was 4.19 seconds (range 2.1-12.6 seconds), an overall mean decrease of 2.35 seconds (36%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent vasospasm reflected by prolonged cerebral circulation times continued to improve with subsequent papaverine infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeated infusions were just as successful quantitatively as the primary treatment (mean change 2.06 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean cerebral circulation time in the control group was 5.21 seconds (range 4-6.8 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In five patients a dramatic reversal of low-attenuation changes was detected on computerized tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean GOS score at 12 months after discharge was 3.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate that multiple intraarterial papaverine treatments consistently improve cerebral circulation times, even with repeated infusions in cases of recurrent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
