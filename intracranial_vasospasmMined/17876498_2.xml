<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Though <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is one of the most serious complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), its complex pathogenesis is poorly understood and available clinical treatment options are unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi>, an immunomodulatory agent with inhibitory properties, on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in a rabbit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two adult New-Zealand rabbits were assigned to 4 groups: control, SAH, SAH plus vehicle, SAH plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by administration of 1 ml of fresh unheparinised autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment was started 12 h after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and administered once a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days later, the animals were sacrificed and the basilar artery was examined histologically for the lumen area and the thickness of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory reaction was also examined by counting white blood cells within the vessel wall by means of light microscopic examination using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Severe and moderate vasospasms were detected in the basilar artery of the SAH and SAH plus vehicle treated groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">Leflunomide</z:chebi> effectively reduced the vasospasm of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to the vehicle treated group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> significantly reduced the lumen area (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the vessel wall (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> within the vessel wall was reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> treated group, no statistical significance was found between groups (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> treatment attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit SAH model while inflammatory reaction in the vessel wall is not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although further studies are needed to reveal its molecular mechanisms in relieving vasospasm, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6402">leflunomide</z:chebi> may provide a therapeutic potential for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by SAH </plain></SENT>
