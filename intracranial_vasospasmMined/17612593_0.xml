<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the expression change of interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene in the basilar artery of rabbit and the effect of IL-8 on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty five healthy Japanese White Rabbits were randomly divided into saline-control group and experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental group was subdivided into four groups, representing day 1, 4, 7 and 14 after the first blood injection of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCVS) model was established by double injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression change of cytokine IL-8 mRNA in the basilar artery was analyzed by RTPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of IL-8 gene increased on day 4-7 after the first blood injection of SAH compared with control (P&lt; 0.001), and decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-8 gene in the SAH groups were positively correlated with the degree of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (r = 0.642, P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression level of IL-8 gene in basilar arteries was intimately associated with the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, suggesting that IL-8 may play an important role in the DCVS after SAH as an immunological inflammatory factor </plain></SENT>
