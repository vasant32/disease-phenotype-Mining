<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotrienes C4</z:chebi> and D4 produced dose-dependent increases in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> did not induce any significant [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal levels of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i peak attained by endothelin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> were higher than those of other compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelin was the most potent in that it induced a high sustained [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i elevation at much lower concentrations compared with others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> and endothelin induced a transient increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i followed by a sustained lower plateau, then the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i level was again increased slowly followed by a sustained higher plateau which lasted for more than 10 min after the exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that endothelin and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> may play a crucial role in contraction of vascular smooth muscle after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
