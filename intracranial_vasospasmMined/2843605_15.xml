<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> (A 23187), the arteries of the treated animals produced a significant amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotrienes B4</z:chebi> (85 +/- 12 pmol/mg protein, n = 3) and C4 (72 +/- 14 pmol/mg), in addition to 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Structural elucidations of these metabolites were performed by radioimmunoassays or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, following purification with HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The artery of the untreated dog produced none of these compounds from either exogenous or endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, under stimulation with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the homogenates from both animals converted exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15651">leukotriene A4</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotrienes B4</z:chebi> and C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar artery contains no detectable amount of 5-lipoxygenase, and that a prominent activation of this enzyme occurred (2.1 nmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28209">5-HETE</z:chebi>/5 min/mg of protein) after subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observation that fatty acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923,35924">hydroperoxides</z:chebi> stimulated the 5-lipoxygenase activity indicates a possible role of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> in the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
