<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the protease involved in the final step of post-translational processing of ET-1, cleaves the inactive precursor big ET-1 at the Trp(21)<z:chebi fb="3" ids="30015">-Val </z:chebi>(22) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, we found that an inhibitor of ECE-1, CGS 26303, could prevent and reverse the arterial narrowing after SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CGS 26393, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> of CGS 26303, is an orally active, long-acting inhibitor of ECE-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effects of CGS 26393 on the prevention and reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to experimental SAH by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the prevention study, the drug was given orally 1 h before the induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drug treatments in the reversal study were initiated at 23 h after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of three dosages (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) of CGS 26393 or vehicle was administrated orally twice daily, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed by perfusion and fixation 48 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and cross-sectional areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected prior to perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of CGS 26393 attenuated SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a dose-dependent manner in both the prevention and reversal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These effects achieved statistical significance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dosages when compared with the SAH-only or SAH plus vehicle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the attenuation of vasospasm following oral administration of CGS 26393 was more efficacious than that obtained with bolus injections of CGS 26303 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The levels of free CGS 26303 in the CSF were increased in a dose-dependent manner in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three CGS 26393-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence that oral administration of an inhibitor of ECE-1, CGS 26393, is capable of preventing and reversing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings also reinforce evidence demonstrating that treatment with an ECE-1 inhibitor is a potentially viable therapeutic approach for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
