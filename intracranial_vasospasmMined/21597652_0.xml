<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Describe the clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> demonstrated by neurovascular studies in patients with ruptured saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 consecutive patients with symptomatic vasospasm, evaluated with TCD and any variant of neurovascular study with contrast injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cases were in degrees between 1 and 3 of the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cognitive and behavioral manifestations were the most frequent (53%), followed by neurological focal deficits (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical vasospasm occurred most frequently between day 9 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm is predominant in the arteries of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high mortality (42%) and the antecedent of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> characterized the group with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical relationship between the result of the scale of Fisher and the symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the TCD parameters had statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations more frequently associated with symptomatic vasospasm were cognitive and behavioral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This group of patients is characterized by a high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The TCD is a test of great value to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
