<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the changes of inflammatory and coagulation factors in blood of the internal jugular vein, not of peripheral vein, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that while interleukin-6 (IL-6) and platelet activating factor (PAF) concentrations increased within first 4 days after SAH and remained elevated up to 14 days, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) showed a transient increase between 5-9 days after SAH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also different coagulation factors were increased between 5-9 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) displayed the highest levels of PAF and the coagulation factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that elevation of PAF and other inflammatory cytokines following SAH may cause the hypercoagulation state that is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and internal jugular vein may be more adequate vessel for sampling blood to examine these factors </plain></SENT>
