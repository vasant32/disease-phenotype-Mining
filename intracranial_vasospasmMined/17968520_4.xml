<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several treatment modalities have been used to reverse the deleterious effects of vasospasm, alternative therapies are needed, as conventional therapies are often ineffective or contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal nicardipine has been suggested for the prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our clinical experience with intraventricular nicardipine for refractory vasospasm in eight patients in whom conventional therapies were ineffective, contraindicated, or technically not feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective case series performed at a tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (median Hunt-Hess grade = 2, median Fisher score = 4) with refractory vasospasm received intraventricular nicardipine (4 mg every 12 h) for a total of 5-17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had moderate to good outcomes with 6 being discharged to home (median Rankin Score = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular nicardipine was well tolerated with minimal side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary observations suggest that intraventricular nicardipine could be considered as a safe and effective treatment modality to treat vasospasm refractory to conventional management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A randomized, controlled trial to verify the efficacy and safety of intrathecal nicardipine in the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is warranted </plain></SENT>
