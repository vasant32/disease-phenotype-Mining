<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> method combined with cisternal irrigation has been proposed to be effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by facilitating rapid washout of the clot from the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The inclusion criteria included the following: 1) Fisher Grade 3 SAH on admission computerized tomography (CT) scans; 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> secured within 48 hours of SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; and 3) no focal deficit and ability to obey commands within 24 hours postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty patients treated between 1994 and 2002 fulfilled the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because only one machine was available and it required I month of maintenance every other month, 114 patients underwent irrigation combined with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> method (<z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> group), whereas the remaining 116 patients received cisternal irrigation alone (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in sex, age, site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, or preoperative grade between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infarction, cerebral</z:e> infarction on CT scans, and permanent ischemic neurological deficit was 25.7, 17.7, and 8.8%, respectively, in the control group and 15.2, 4.5, and 2.7% in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> infarction, and permanent ischemic neurological deficit (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head shaking</z:mp> was the only variable that was predictive of permanent ischemic neurological deficit (p = 0.061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcomes evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale were better in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> group (p = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> method significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasospasm, cerebral</z:e> infarction, and permanent ischemic neurological deficit and improved the clinical outcomes in patients who underwent cisternal irrigation therapy after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
