<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Canine or feline subarachnoid space was irrigated with low pH (6.49 +/- 0.06, N = 10) physiological saline or with high pH (8.0) Hartmann solutions after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by cisternal autologous blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographical changes of the basilar artery, neurological conditions, platelet functions in blood taken from the superior sagittal sinus, and histological findings particularly those concerning intraarterial blood were examined comparatively before and after the irrigation and, in relation to different irrigation fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in the angiographical changes of the basilar artery either before or after irrigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither did different irrigation fluids have an effect on these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for the neurological conditions, however, deterioration after irrigation was more frequent and evident in the group treated with physiological saline than in the group treated with Hartmann solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet function in the blood taken from the superior sagittal sinus also tended to be more activated in the group treated with physiological saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with physiological saline, histopathological examination of the autopsied brain revealed marked intraluminal platelets aggregation, particularly in the basilar artery and its branches where subarachnoid clots were mostly evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An affirmative result for the preamble was obtained in this study </plain></SENT>
