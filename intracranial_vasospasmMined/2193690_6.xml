<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a first series of experiments, male Long Evans rats were chronically instrumented for the measurement of internal carotid blood flow and systemic arterial blood pressure; cardiovascular changes were assessed during and after 30 min infusions of human alpha-calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) (0.06 and 0.6 nmol h-1), or nimodipine (60 and 600 nmol h-1) or human alpha-CGRP plus nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of human alpha-CGRP or nimodipine on internal carotid vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human alpha-CGRP (0.06 nmol h-1) caused a small (+15%), transient increase in internal carotid blood flow and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (+33 beats min-1), but no change in mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine (60 nmol h-1) caused a brief internal carotid hyperaemia (+16%) but no changes in blood pressure or heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, concurrent administration of human alpha-CGRP (0.06 nmol h-1) and nimodipine (60 nmol h-1) caused a sustained increase in internal carotid blood flow (+40%) unaccompanied by significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human alpha-CGRP at a dose of 0.6 nmol h-1 or nimodipine at a dose of 600 nmol h-1 caused substantial reductions in internal carotid vascular resistance (-43 and -40%, respectively); concurrent administration of these doses did not have an additive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infusion of endothelin-1 (1.2nmolhV1) for 20min caused incremental constriction of the internal carotid vascular bed; human alpha-CGRP infusion (0.6 and 6.0nmolh-1) begun tOmin after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of endothelin-1 infusion reversed this effect (dose-dependently); nimodipine (600nmolh-1) also caused a substantial attenuation of the effects of endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments the haemodynamic effects of human alpha-CGRP and/or nimodipine were assessed in rats chronically instrumented for the measurement of renal, superior mesenteric and hindquarters blood flow together with systemic arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Administration of human alpha-CGRP (0.06 nmol h-') alone or in conjuction with nimodipine (60nmolh-1) had no significant effects on renal or superior mesenteric vascular resistances, although there was a slight hindquarters vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Human alpha-CGRP at a dose of 0.6 nmol -1 caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and reductions in renal and superior mesenteric blood flows, together with a marked (+31% maximum) hindquarters hyperaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine at a dose of 600 nmol h-1 caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and a reduction (-34%) in renal blood flow; mesenteric blood flow was unchanged and there was an increase in hindquarters flow (+ 59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Concurrent administration of human alpha-CGRP (0.6 nmol h 1) and nimodipine (600 nmol h') did not have an additive hypotensive effect or an enhanced hindquarters hyperaemic effect, but was associated with a marked impairment of renal blood flow (-48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that concurrent administration of low doses of human alpha-CGRP and nimodipine might be particularly helpful in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and impaired renal perfusion, since this intervention improved internal carotid blood flow without compromising blood flow to the kidney </plain></SENT>
