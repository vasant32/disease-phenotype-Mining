<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of endothelium in extraluminally induced vasospasm of the cerebral artery using isolated perfused canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extraluminal applications of high K+ and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) induced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both constrictive responses were significantly enhanced by denuding endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the responses in the endothelium-intact arteries were markedly augmented by intraluminal perfusion with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">NG-monomethyl-L-arginine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase in endothelium enhances increase in transmembrane Ca(2+)-influx which is a common constrictive mechanism to the vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The augmentative action induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> was inhibited by intraluminal perfusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15816">D-arginine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the augmentation was not observed in the arteries without endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the endothelium may have a great significance on responsiveness to extraluminal vasoactive substances and that endothelium-derived NO may modulate the extraluminally induced vasoconstriction which is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
