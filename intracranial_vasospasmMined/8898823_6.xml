<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it has been suggested that collagen plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, there has been no constructive research to prove it directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we stopped the transcription of the procollagen type I gene by introducing antisense oligonucleotides for its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in a rat femoral artery model of vasospasm induced by blood and assayed the changes in the vasoconstrictive activity of the vessel and expression of the procollagen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied antisense, sense, or missense oligonucleotides, located at the carboxyl propeptide region for alpha 1(I) procollagen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, onto the femoral artery in a rat femoral artery model of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the artery was measured by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transcription level of the procollagen gene in the arterial tissue was assayed by use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphological change in the artery was observed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi>-fuchsin-Masson-Goldner staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the model, when the artery was exposed to antisense oligonucleotides in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">pluronic</z:chebi> gel for 5 days to prevent arterial contraction, the contraction was inhibited at a significant level (76.0% +/- 5.6) when compared with that in control experiments using sense oligonucleotides (64.0% +/- 2.4), missense oligonucleotides (63.5% +/- 3.5), or gel alone (62.1% +/- 5.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The application of antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a marked decrease in alpha 1(I) procollagen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression as determined by polymerase chain reaction, indicating that the collagen reduction by antisense oligonucleotides occurred at the transcription level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological staining suggested that collagen accumulation at the site in the artery where antisense oligonucleotide had been administered was indeed less than that in the control artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the induction of procollagen type 1 could cause pathogenesis of the arterial contraction induced by blood in a rat femoral vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
