<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> treated with intra-arterial dantrolene after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 56-year-old woman suffered a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from a ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> which was successfully treated with coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She subsequently developed bilateral severe angiographic vasospasm which was treated with intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, owing to the recurrence of vasospasm, intra-arterial dantrolene followed by balloon angioplasty was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was moderate improvement of the severe vasospasm in bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries after microcatheter-based intra-arterial infusion of 30 ml (1 mg/ml) dantrolene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored during and after the procedure and no significant changes were seen after dantrolene infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A follow up cerebral angiogram after 1 day demonstrated the persistence of therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial dantrolene induced a sustained improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant side effects were observed during or after the infusion of the drug </plain></SENT>
