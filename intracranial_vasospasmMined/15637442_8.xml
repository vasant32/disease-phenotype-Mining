<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously reported that protein kinase C (PKC)-delta was initially translocated from the cytosol to the membrane fraction (on day 4), followed by PKC-alpha, with the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rho/Rho-kinase pathways have also been proposed to be involved in the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus we investigated the interactive role of Rho-kinase and PKC in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was produced using a 'two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>' canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated with Y-27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, and rottlerin, a PKC-delta inhibitor, both injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Y-27632 inhibited the vasospasm, 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation, and PKC-delta translocation after the second injection of autologous blood on day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Y-27632 did not affect the vasospasm on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rottlerin also inhibited the vasospasm on day 4, but had no effect on MLC20 phosphorylation and RhoA translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm was accompanied with the phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD), an actin-linked regulatory protein, which was strongly attenuated by Y-27632 and rottlerin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The application of PKC-delta to skinned strips of isolated canine basilar arteries caused a contraction and an increase in CaD phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH (on day 4) is caused by at least two mechanisms: one involves MLC20 phosphorylation mediated by the inhibition of MLC20 phosphatase by Rho-kinase, and the other CaD phosphorylation mediated by the activation of PKC-delta by Rho-kinase, which results in the alleviation of the inhibition by CaD of myosin Mg2+-ATPase activity </plain></SENT>
