<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effects of these neuropeptides to the experimentally produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> were also examined in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced by a single injection of fresh autologous arterial blood (1 ml/kg body weight) or double injection of arterial blood (0.5 ml/kg body weight, 48 hours apart) into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constriction of basilar artery was most prominent on Day 3 in the single injection model, and on Day 7 in the double injection model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of nerve fibers with CGRP-or VIP-like immunoreactivity (LI) was markedly decreased during 7-14 days or 3-7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatory actions of CGRP and VIP to isolated basilar artery in vitro were markedly impaired during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of post-SAH period and significantly enhanced during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of post-SAH period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal bolus injection of 10(-10) mol/kg CGRP completely reversed cerebral arterial constriction on Day 3 of single injection SAH model, and intracisternal injection of 10(-11) to 2 x 10(-10) mol/kg CGRP reversed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> dose-dependently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial injection of CGRP could not reversed cerebral arterial constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of VIP was much weaker than CGRP </plain></SENT>
