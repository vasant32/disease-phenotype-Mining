<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic cerebral digital subtraction angiography revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located at the left internal carotid-anterior choroidal artery with diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization was selected because of diffuse spasm in spite of parent artery elongation at the extra-cranial portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A small portion of the coil migrated to the parent artery, but coil embolization was successfully completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient developed delayed spasm, which required arterial fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the patient's symptoms disappeared </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Craniotomy was performed to retrieve the coil and clip the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the migrated coil could not be retrieved because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed coil migration is very rare in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
