<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unilateral induction of SAH by clot placement around cerebral arteries produced a moderate degree of vasospasm (more than 40% reduction of vessel caliber on angiogram) seven days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abolishment of autoregulation was observed in the territories of the cerebral hemisphere supplied by the vasospastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that in this region an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure easily produced a marked elevation of the cerebral blood flow over the upper limit of autoregulation threshold resulting in disruption of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
