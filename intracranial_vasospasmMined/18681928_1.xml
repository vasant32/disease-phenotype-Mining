<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study assessed the impact of treatment modality of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) on the rate of vasospasm (VSP), mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS) of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed patients with aSAH admitted between 1999 and 2005 undergoing either endovascular coiling (EC) or surgical clipping (SC) within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical VSP was defined as neurological deficits unexplained by another etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiological VSP was defined based on transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and CT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and logistic regression analysis was used to determine VSP predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 216 patients included, 98 (45%) underwent EC and 118 (55%) underwent SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical VSP was found in 26% of EC and 40% of SC patients (P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD VSP, angiographic VSP, and CT infarctions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in the SC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was similar in both groups however the LOS was longer in the SC patients (P= .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that SC doubled the risk of clinical VSP (P &lt; .03) and tripled the risk of composite VSP (P &lt; .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that EC has a lower rate of VSP, shorter LOS, and comparable mortality to SC in aSAH </plain></SENT>
