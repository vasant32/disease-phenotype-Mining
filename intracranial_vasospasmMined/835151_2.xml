<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spasm was reversed by methysergide, an antiserotonin agent </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests platelet <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> or a similar, unidentified substance as the vasospastic element in dog blood responsible for experimental vasospasm from topically applied whole blood </plain></SENT>
