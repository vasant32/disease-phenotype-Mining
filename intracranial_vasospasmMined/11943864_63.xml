<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, i.p. administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu-EPO) has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect during experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate further the effect of r-Hu-EPO administration after SAH in rabbits on neurological outcome, degree of basilar artery spasm, and magnitude of neuronal ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental animals were divided into six groups: group 1 (n = 8), control; group 2 (n = 8), control plus placebo; group 3 (n = 8), control plus r-Hu-EPO; group 4 (n = 8), SAH; group 5 (n = 8), SAH plus placebo; group 6 (n = 8), SAH plus r-Hu-EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>r-Hu-EPO, at a dose of 1,000 units/kg, and placebo were injected i.p. starting 5 min after inducing SAH and followed by clinical and pathological assessment 72 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic administration of r-Hu-EPO produced significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid EPO concentrations (P &lt; 0.001), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003026'>reduced vasoconstriction</z:mp> of the basilar artery (P &lt; 0.05), ischemic neuronal damage (P &lt; 0.001), and subsequent neurological deterioration (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that r-Hu-EPO may provide an effective treatment to reduce the post-SAH morbidity </plain></SENT>
