<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporary vessel occlusion is an integral part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping to avoid intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information concerning the role of temporary occlusion regarding the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to provide more information in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We operated on 292 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were reviewed from a prospectively collected databank, which includes information about the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, as well as transcranial Doppler data and surgical data such as temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 50% of our patients, temporary occlusion was performed during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine percent showed an ischemic lesion in the CCT post-operatively, and in 58% of these patients, temporary occlusion was performed (versus 47% without temporary occlusion, p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean occlusion time was longer in patients with radiologic signs of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients having unfavorable outcome showed a longer temporary occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four percent of patients who underwent temporary vessel occlusion developed vasospasm postoperatively (versus 20% without temporary occlusion, p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Temporary occlusion time correlated to the development of vasospasm as defined by transcranial Doppler flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of the patients treated using temporary occlusion suffered from middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> (versus 22% without temporary occlusion, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An increased blood flow velocity was mostly seen in this region (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to our results, it seems to be the possible that temporary vessel occlusion is an additional factor in aggravating vasospasm after aneurysmatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
