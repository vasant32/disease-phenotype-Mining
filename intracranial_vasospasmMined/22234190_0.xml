<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite dramatic advances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medical era, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is still the major complication in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of intraarterial (IA) nimodipine in the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm and in preventing neurological disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients of SAH who received IA nimodipine in 15 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform angiography and endovascular treatment was based on the neurological examination, brain computed tomography (CT) and CT-angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure reports, anesthesia records, neurological examination before and after the procedure, brain imaging and short- and long-term outcome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average dose of nimodipine was 2 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median change in mean arterial pressure at 10 min was -10 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant change of heart rate was observed at 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was radiological improvement in 80% of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement was noted after eight out of 12 procedures when nimodipine was used as the sole treatment and after 10 out of 15, overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients clinically improved after the treatment and had good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> caused fatal anterior and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral arteries infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no other neurological deficit or radiological abnormality due to the nimodipine treatment itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose IA nimodipine is a valid adjunct for the endovascular treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effects are achieved in some patients, prompting a prospective control study </plain></SENT>
