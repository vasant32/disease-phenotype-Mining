<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After control studies using MRA and conventional angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced on day 0 in 7 Japanese monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA and conventional angiography were then repeated on day 7 to observe the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactivity of cerebral vessels to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was also studied in both control animals (angiography before SAH) and on day 7 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was detected by both conventional angiography and MRA on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arteries on the side of the clot were more spastic than those on the control side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA was superior to conventional angiography in demonstrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of both control arteries (before SAH induction) and vasospastic arteries (on day 7 after SAH) after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
