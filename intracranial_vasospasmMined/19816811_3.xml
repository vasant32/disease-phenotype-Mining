<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Medical treatment of arterial vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) generally consists of triple H therapy, which frequently relies on inotropic agents in order to increase cardiac output (CO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with concurrent left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction may have paradoxical decreases in CO following administration of inotropic pressors, placing them at significant risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical courses of two patients with SAH-induced arterial vasospasm and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular outflow obstruction</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and low cardiac output that were refractory to medical management with triple H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography in both patients demonstrated LVOT obstruction secondary to hypertrophic obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HOCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intervention in both patients included discontinuation of inotropic agents and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> to a target pulmonary capillary wedge pressure range, resulting in improved cardiac output and mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Medical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with inotropic pressor agents may result in paradoxical decreases in hemodynamic parameters and cerebral perfusion in patients with LVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While HOCM is the most likely structural abnormality to cause this phenomenon, it can be induced by several physiological conditions encountered in the neurocritical care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modifications in triple H therapy regimens may be required in order to optimize cerebral perfusion and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
