<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of the novel and ET(A) receptor selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> LU 208075 was characterized by the contraction and relaxation induced by ET-1 and bigET-1 on rat basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery ring segments with (E+) and without (E-) functionally intact endothelium were prepared to measure the isometric force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentration-effect curves were constructed by cumulative application of ET-1 or bigET-1 in the presence of LU 208075 (10(-7)M, 10(-6)M, and 10(-5)M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of LU 208075 was determined by the pA(2) value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contraction by ET-1 and bigET-1 was inhibited by LU 208075 in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pA(2) values for ET-1 and for bigET-1 were 6.51 +/- 0.39 (E+) and 6.67 +/- 0.43 (E-), and 7.03 +/- 0.32 (E+) and 7.24 +/- 0.31 (E-) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The E(max) values for bigET-1 but not for ET-1 were reduced significantly in the presence of LU 208075 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant relaxation by ET-1 or bigET-1 was observed only in the presence of LU 208075 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This relaxation was inhibited by LU 208075 in higher concentrations, with pA(2) values of 5.68 +/- 0.05 (ET-1) and 5.50 +/- 0.39 (bigET-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current data correlate with a competitive inhibition of ET(A) receptor-mediated contraction and relaxation, caused by ET(B) receptor activation on cerebral vessels by LU 208075 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The selectivity for the ET(A) receptor was approximately sevenfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results may suggest an inhibition of the functional ET-converting enzyme activity by LU 208075 </plain></SENT>
