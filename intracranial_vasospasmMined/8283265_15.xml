<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An investigation was undertaken of the mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and its analog methemoglobin might cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of these compounds on the levels of intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> and calcium in cultured primate cerebrovascular smooth-muscle cells and the contractile action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> on isolated rings of primate cerebral arteries were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, but not methemoglobin, produces a transient but highly significant increase in the intracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular calcium levels in these cells are increased by thrombin, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> tetrafluoride, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, and the sustained elevation in intracellular calcium is prevented by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30742">ethyleneglycol</z:chebi> tetra-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> and the phospholipase C inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> after as long as 48 hours' incubation with this compound allowed cells to rapidly reduce their intracellular calcium levels to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> produced contractions of isolated rings of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and spastic cerebral arteries, although the response of spastic vessels was significantly smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> relaxed arteries that were contracted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is thus likely that activation of phospholipase C is a critical step in the development of vasospasm, but the transient nature of the response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> suggests that the sustained contraction may arise from other phospholipase C-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
