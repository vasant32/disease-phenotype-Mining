<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of intracisternal administration of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the experimental SAH rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat double-SAH model (0.2 mL autologous blood injected twice into the cisterna magna) was used </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The weighted average CBF was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01, Student's t-test) in the SAH group (0.78+/-0.16 mL g(-1) min(-1)) compared to the control group (1.0+/-0.15 mL g(-1) min(-1)) and was significantly improved (P&lt;0.01, Student's t-test) in the SAH + MG group (0.98+/-0.18 mL g(-1) min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local CBF was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05, unpaired t test) in 16 locations in the SAH group and significantly improved (P &lt; 0.05, unpaired t test) in 12 locations in the SAH + MG group </plain></SENT>
