<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A new technique using intravascular ultrasound has been used for diagnosis of coronary artery in order to obtain intravascular echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, an intracisternally positioned ultrasound catheter was introduced obtaining serial echo images of the first segment (MI) of the middle cerebral artery in order to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients were admitted to Osaka Neurological Institute with SAH due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgical neck clipping on the day of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient, an 8 Fr. ultrasound imaging catheter (Cardiovascular Imaging Systems, Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(CVIS), Sunnyvale, CA) was detained intracisternally adjacent to the M1 segment following neck clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and placement of cisternal drainage(s) in the prepontine and/or distal portion of the Sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to detain the mirro device near the M1 segment, the tip of a 2.0 cm cisternal drainage tube (SILASCON, E-3L-12, Kaneka Medix Co, Osaka, Japan) was attached to the tip of the intravascular ultrasound catheter with 3-0 silk suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tip was placed in the prechiasmal cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was obtained for three (23.1%) of the 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one (33.3%) of the three patients who had angiographic evidence of vasospasm (25% stenosis), decrease in the inner diameter of the M1 segment was detected on the echo images, but in the other two (66.7%), no such decrease was noted on echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographically identified vasospasm in the latter patients was associated with only 10% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracisternally positioned ultrasound catheter can be used for intermittent measurement of the diameter of a target artery for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
