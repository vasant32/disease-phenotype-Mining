<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was carried out to clarify if there has been any improvement in the outcome of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> during the past 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because elderly patients have apparently poorer prognoses than younger patients, patients older than 70 years were analyzed separately in the following article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred seventy-one patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, under 70 years, who were consecutively admitted to Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital from July 1972 to December 1992, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into four groups according to the time of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultimate outcome was evaluated by means of Glasgow Outcome Scale 6 months after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in treatment protocol in this period included the induction of early surgery and the invention of a variety of modalities for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a distinct increase in patients who actually underwent direct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome has been significantly improved during this period, especially in patients with Hunt and Kosnik grade III (p&lt;0.05, chi2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in good clinical condition at follow-up (Glasgow Outcome Scale: good recovery) increased from 8.7% to 60.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality decreased from 28.7% to 10.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current therapeutic modalities have significantly improved the outcome of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding before early surgery remains as a major cause of unfavorable outcome and further progress on this subject is mandatory </plain></SENT>
