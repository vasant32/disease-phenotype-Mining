<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively determine the accuracy of transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography (US) used alone and in conjunction with carotid artery US for diagnosis of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) spasm, with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) used as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional ethics committee approved the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient, or members of the patient's family, gave informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty consecutive patients (64 women, 56 men; mean age, 45.5 years +/- 13.6 [standard deviation]) were routinely referred for DSA after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was graded as mild (&lt; or =25% reduction in vessel diameter), moderate (&gt;25% to 50% reduction), or severe (&gt;50% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>US was performed 2 hours or less before angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)) to flow velocity in the ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery (V(ICA)) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of the difference between the two Az values (for US vs DSA) was determined by using the z test with correction for correlated data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of 120 patients were excluded because of inadequacy of acoustic windows in the squama of temporal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spasm was mild in 17, moderate in 16, and severe in only nine of 222 arteries studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Arteries with moderate or severe vasospasm were combined in one group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The best-performing parameters were peak systolic velocity and V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Az values for these two parameters in diagnosis of moderate-to-severe vasospasm were 0.93 and 0.95, and in diagnosis of mild vasospasm, 0.90 and 0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) ratio calculated on the basis of end-diastolic velocity for diagnosis of mild <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> narrowing was significantly better than that of end-diastolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity alone (Az = 0.88 vs 0.84, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The stepwise approach with use of the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) ratio after flow velocity measurements in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> resulted in a decreased number of false-negative findings in both vasospasm subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The thresholds of highest efficiency were at a mean velocity of 94 and 108 cm/sec and a peak systolic V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) ratio of 3.6 and 3.9 for diagnosis of mild and moderate-to-severe vasospasm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcranial color-coded duplex US alone or in conjunction with carotid artery US has excellent accuracy for angiographic detection of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity measurements and V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) ratio can increase the accuracy of Doppler US </plain></SENT>
