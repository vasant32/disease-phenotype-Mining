<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With no rigid regard to "timing" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergo surgery as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only exception being those in Hunt and Hess grades IV and V without space-occupying intracranial haemorrhage and those bearing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar circulation that are difficult of access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As soon as the risk of rebleeding has been eliminated surgically an active therapy against the possible consequences of SAH--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and simultaneous disturbances of autoregulation--is started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It consists in lowering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, raising of mean arterial pressure and improving of rheological properties of the blood in order to prevent delayed build-up of neurological deficit due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It goes without saying that calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are given from the very beginning of the patient's treatment even before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The advantages of this therapeutic concept are demonstrated by two series of non-selected consecutive patient material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first series (A; n = 135) was treated between 1981 and 1984 before the change in treatment strategy, the second (B; n = 183) from 1984 to 1986 after that change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality in series A was 27%, that in series B 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality could be reduced from 22% to 16% in patients having undergone early operation and from 6% to 2% in patients with late surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
