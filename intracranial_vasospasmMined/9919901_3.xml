<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgery within 96 hours following SAH and received the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046, as part of standard care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FUT-175 (40-160 mg/day) was administered during the initial 4 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>455 patients treated without FUT-175 in the Nagasaki SAH Data Bank (non-FUT group) formed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FUT-175 significantly decreased the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in patients with severe neurological grade (Hunt and Hess grade 3, p &lt; 0.02; Hunt and Hess grade 4, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of favorable outcome was 76.5% in the FUT group and 60.4% in the non-FUT group, but not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when patients of Hunt and Hess grade 5 were excluded, the FUT group had a significantly improved outcome (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that FUT-175 has an additive effect to OKY-046 in preventing vasospasm in high risk patients with severe SAH </plain></SENT>
