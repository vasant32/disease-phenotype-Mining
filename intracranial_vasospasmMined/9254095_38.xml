<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been proposed that endothelin-1 (ET-1) mediates vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined this hypothesis in a series of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a primate model of SAH, serial ET-1 levels were measured in samples from the perivascular space by using a microdialysis technique and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma during the development and resolution of delayed vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether elevated ET-1 production was a direct cause of vasospasm or acted secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the authors also measured ET-1 levels in plasma and CSF after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the source of ET-1, they measured its production in cultures of endothelial cells and astrocytes exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (10 microM), methemoglobin (10 microM), or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (11% oxygen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the perivascular levels of ET-1 and the development of vasospasm or its resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma levels of ET-1 were not affected by vasospasm (CSF ET-1 levels were 9.3 +/- 2.2 pg/ml and ET-1 plasma levels were 1.2 +/- 0.6 pg/ml) before SAH and remained unchanged when vasospasm developed (7.1 +/- 1.7 pg/ml in CSF and 2.7 +/- 1.5 pg/ml in plasma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> evoked an increase of ET-1 levels in CSF (1 +/- 0.4 pg/ml at the occlusion vs. 3.1 +/- 0.6 pg/ml 4 hours after reperfusion; p &lt; 0.05), which returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0.7 +/- 0.3 pg/ml) after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells and astrocytes in culture showed inhibition of ET-1 production 6 hours after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> inhibited ET-1 release by endothelial cells at 24 hours (6.4 +/- 0.8 pg/ml vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 pg/ml, control vs. hypoxic endothelial cells; p &lt; 0.05) and at 48 hours (6.4 +/- 0.6 pg/ml vs. 0 +/- 0.1 pg/ml, control vs. hypoxic endothelial cells; p &lt; 0.05), but in astrocytes <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induced an increase of ET-1 at 6 hours (1.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.1 pg/ml, control vs. hypoxic astrocytes; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 is released from astrocytes, but not endothelial cells, during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and is released from the brain after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no relationship between ET-1 and vasospasm in vivo or between ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, a putative agent of vasospasm, in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increase in ET-1 levels in CSF after SAH from a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> appears to be the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rather than reflecting the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
