<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>Hypervolemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis and treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at many institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about the preferred modality (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or both), the degree of therapy (moderate or aggressive), and the risk or benefit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Monitoring data and patient charts for 45 patients were retrospectively searched to identify periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of central venous pressure, fluid input, urine output, arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi>) in the brain tissue were extracted from periods ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these periods, the change in brain tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> and the incidence of complications were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 55 periods of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, an increase in brain tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> was found in 50 cases (90%), with complications occurring in three patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 25 periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during three intervals (12%), with complications occurring in nine patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 10 periods of aggressive hypervolemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during six of the intervals (60%), with complications in five patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> treatment is applied as in this study, it may be associated with increased risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Note, however, that further studies are needed to determine the role of this therapeutic modality in the care of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In poor-grade patients, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (cerebral perfusion pressure 80-120 mm Hg) in a normovolemic, hemodiluted patient is an effective method of improving cerebral oxygenation and is associated with a lower complication rate compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> or aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
