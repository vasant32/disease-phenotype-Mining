<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">Adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel openers (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOs</z:e>) appear to be particularly effective for dilating cerebral arteries in experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mode of safe administration that provides timed release of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e> drugs is still a subject of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors tested the efficacy of locally delivered intrathecal cromakalim, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>, incorporated into a controlled-release system to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cromakalim was coupled to a viscous carrier, hyaluronan, 15% by weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro release kinetics studies showed a steady release of cromakalim over days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350-400 g each were divided into 10 groups and treated with various doses of cromakalim or cromakalim/hyaluronan in a rat double SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started 30 minutes after the second SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 3 days after treatment, and the basilar arteries were processed for morphometric measurements and histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controlled release of cromakalim from the cromakalim/hyaluronan implant at a dose of 0.055 mg/kg significantly increased lumen patency in a dose-dependent manner up to 94 +/- 8% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of the basilar arteries of the sham group compared with the empty polymer group (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results in the empty polymer group were not different from those in the SAH-only group, with a lumen patency of 65 +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lumen patencies of the cromakalim-only groups did not differ in statistical significance at low (64 +/- 9%) or high (66 +/- 7%) doses compared to the SAH-only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SAH with a controlled-release cromakalim/hyaluronan implant prevented experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this rat double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model; this inhibition was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors' results confirm that sustained delivery of cromakalim perivascularly to cerebral vessels could be an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
