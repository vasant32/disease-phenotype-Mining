<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible therapeutic effects of clenbuterol on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen male <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> Wistar rats, each weighing 200-250 g, were randomized into three groups; Group 1 (Control group) (n = 6) having no SAH and no treatment; Group 2 (Sham group) (n = 6) having only SAH and Group 3 (Experimental group) (n = 6) having SAH treated with clenbuterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 2 has been accepted as sham group to the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was induced using a modified rat double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clenbuterol was administered twice daily in 12-hour intervals for three days at a dose of 0,1 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of the basilar artery was measured on each section with an optic micrometer by an experienced pathologist blinded to the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean basilar artery diameters were found to be different between the three groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean value of Group 2 was significantly lower than that of Group 1 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While mean value of Group 3 was significantly greater than that of Group 2 (p = 0.001), Groups1 and 3 were found to be similar (p = 0242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clenbuterol has favorable effects in the treatment of rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are needed to evaluate both molecular effects and to find out effective treatment dose of clenbuterol on CVS </plain></SENT>
