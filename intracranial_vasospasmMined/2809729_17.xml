<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of the lumbar CSF levels revealed that the C3a and C4a levels were significantly elevated in the initial stage of SAH, but decreased rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 48 hours after SAH, the mean C3a and C4a levels in the cisternal, lumbar, and ventricular CSF were significantly higher in patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) than in those without DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serially measured plasma levels of C3a and C4a in patients with DIND were elevated more than in those without DIND, but they did not show a significant change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), an indicator of thrombin activity in CSF, were also measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between CSF-activated complement components and CSF FPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that complement activation occurred in the subarachnoid space soon after SAH, chiefly due to activation of the coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher CSF levels of C3a and C4a in patients with DIND may indicate a relationship between these components and the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
