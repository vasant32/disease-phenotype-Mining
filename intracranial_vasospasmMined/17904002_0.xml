<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of 32 patients treated by early surgery within 24 hours developed critical cerebral swelling in the early period after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of these 6 patients received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of advancing cerebral swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of 5 patients who received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy showed good recovery without any neurologic deficit, 1 suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo>, and the other 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, and dynamic CT evaluated elapsing of cerebral swelling, progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and change of cerebral blood perfusion (flow) in 2 patients who suffered early cerebral swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these 2 patients, progression or persistence of vasospasm was recorded for a longer period, whereas the cerebral swelling resolved within a short period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by vasospasm was seen in 8 of these 38 surgical cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was seen in 15 of 38 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 survivors after early cerebral swelling developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and underwent shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Development of cerebral swelling in patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> greatly affects outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy is useful for the treatment of patients who suffer serious cerebral swelling, improvements in management may be required </plain></SENT>
