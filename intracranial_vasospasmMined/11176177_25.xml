<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that graded CA impairment is predictive of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about whether such impairment is present, what causes CA impairment, whether it precedes vasospasm, and whether it is predictive of outcome in patients with severe aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neurosurgical intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twelve patients after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 40 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Recording of cerebral blood flow velocities and continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure at a controlled ventilatory frequency of six per minute to standardize the influence of intrathoracic pressure changes on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We calculated the phase shift angles (deltaphidegrees) between slow (0.1 Hz) arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity waves measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery during a) posthemorrhage days (PHD) 1-6 (early or prevasospasm phase), and b) during PHD 7-13 (late or vasospasm phase) using a 6/min ventilation protocol, and in 40 controls spontaneously ventilating at the same rate. deltaphi &lt;30 degrees indicated lost CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocities &gt;100 cm/sec were considered vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We combined early and late measurements to assess the CA relationship with low cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and/or vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We assessed the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge (1 = worst, 5 = best) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The admission Hunt and Hess score was 3.6 +/- 0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GOS scores were n = 3 (GOS 1), n = 2 (GOS 2), n = 5 (GOS 3), n = 1 (GOS 4), and n = 1 (GOS 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the early phase, deltaphi was 40.4 +/- 19.8 degrees (left), and 40.4 +/- 19.2 degrees (right) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CPP was 69.4 +/- 10.9, intracranial pressure (ICP) was 6.7 +/- 2.8 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the late phase, deltaphi worsened in six patients and none improved: 32.1 +/- 21 degrees (left), and 26.9 +/- 17.2 degrees (right); CPP was 68.1 +/- 12.1, ICP was 7.5 +/- 3.7 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CA was significantly impaired in both phases when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (deltaphi: 65.7 +/- 24.5 degrees; p &lt; .01 for early, p &lt; .001 for late phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the early phase, seven of eight patients in whom autoregulation was intact had a GOS &gt;2 at discharge and disturbed CA on at least one side was predictive of either vegetative condition at discharge or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the late phase, deltaphi was no longer predictive of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Spasm was present in 8 of 17 vessels (47%) in which CA was lost; no spasm was found in 25 of 28 vessels (89%) in which CA was intact (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A low CPP was present in 6 of 17 vessels (35%) in which CA was lost; a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CPP was found in 21 of 27 vessels (78%) in which CA was intact (p &gt; .05, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, 14 of 17 vessels (82%) with lost CA showed spasm and/or low CPP while only 8 of 27 cases (30%) with intact CA had either spasm or low CPP (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CA can be assessed in a graded fashion in SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CA impairment precedes vasospasm; ongoing vasospasm worsens CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CA assessment early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, within PHD 1-6, is predictive of outcome whereas late assessment is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>CA impairment is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and low CPP </plain></SENT>
