<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated cisternal injections of blood at various intervals produced more severe spasm than a single injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After perfusion-fixation of the brain, the cerebral arteries were examined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the animals showed abnormalities in the intima or media of the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously reported findings of morphological changes due to spasm could not be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination of brain vessels from nine patients with SAH and arterial spasm showed no specific changes that could be ascribed to spasm </plain></SENT>
