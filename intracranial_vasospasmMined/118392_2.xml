<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our experimental animal model, SAH was associated with a persistent reduction in rCBF, elevation of cerebrovascular resistance (CVR), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> for the duration of the study (150 minutes), and poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For animals receiving the treatment regime (administered approximately 25 minutes after the induced SAH), rCBF remained low, CVR was high, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival in this group was the same as that observed for the untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was ineffective in improving rCBF, CVR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, or survival after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group (receiving only the treatment and not an intracranial insult), rCBF was below resting levels both during and after therapy, indicating impaired cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
