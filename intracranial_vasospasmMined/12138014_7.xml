<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study was undertaken to explore the possible protective effect of caspase inhibitors Z-VDVAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and vasospasm in penetrating arteries during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced in 16 dogs by an intracisternal injection of autologous arterial blood (0.4 ml/kg) on Day 0 and Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dogs were then randomly divided into four groups: control-SAH, vehicle-control, and two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the treatment groups, caspase inhibitors (10 microM) were intracisternally injected each day beginning on Day 2 until Day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of the inhibitors were analyzed utilizing angiography, the clinical status of the dogs (activity, appetite, and neurological deficits), and transmission electron microscopy of the penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the dogs were sacrificed on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control-SAH and vehicle-control groups, severe angiographic vasospasm, poor clinical status, and penetrating vasospasm were registered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the treatment groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dogs developed angiographic vasospasm and vasospasm in penetrating arteries, however, with benign clinical statues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in endothelial cells was reduced by caspase-2 but not by caspase-3 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caspase inhibitors failed to prevent vasospasm either in major or in penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement of clinical scores by the caspase inhibitors may be related to their protection of the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations using more rigorous clinical scoring system and quantitative information on the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the vessels, as well as in the brain parenchyma are recommended </plain></SENT>
