<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed some extent of vasospasm on angiography, which was performed between Day 7 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The flow velocities of either the middle cerebral arteries or the anterior cerebral arteries, measured by TCD, began to increase on post <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> Day 5, and maximum flow velocities were recorded between Day 9 and 13, with normalization occurring within the following 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases of symptomatic vasospasm, a rapid increase of flow velocities preceded clinical manifestation of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum flow velocities of the 5 cases were at a higher level in the range of 119-184cm/sec (mean 149cm/sec) that the cases where there were no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, serial TCD examinations were very useful for the early detection of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And it was confirmed that the change of flow velocities was more important than the value itself, and that the rapid increase of flow velocities indicated severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, for judging when vessel narrowing was resolving, the usefulness of the TCD examinations were doubtful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is because flow velocities measured by TCD are thought to be fairly much influenced by multiple factors such as the change of blood pressure, blood volume, which were caused by the active treatment for the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of CBF were also made 2-7 times (mean 3.1 times) during the first two weeks following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> using the 133Xe intravenous injection method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
