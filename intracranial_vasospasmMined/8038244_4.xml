<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> analysis for cyclic patterns, we examined peak to trough ratios and months of peak to assess the strength and nature of the cyclic variations between December 1980 and July 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 3,521 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patient records examined, 685 developed some grade of vasospasm as defined symptomatically, angiographically, and by the Fisher Grading Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclic analysis demonstrated a strong seasonal occurrence for the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, with a peak in February, in the northern hemisphere </plain></SENT>
