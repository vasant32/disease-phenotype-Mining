<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the vasocontractile activities of purified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, methemoglobin, <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> of linoleic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> were examined in vitro, using the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them possess a vasocontractile capacity in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fresh canine arterial blood was incubated at 37 degree C for 2 weeks, and the daily change of its vasocontractile capacity and the amount of TBA-reactive substance was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study revealed a gradual and parallel increase in both of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a clinical study with 32 SAH patients, the amount of TBA-reactive substance in the CSF was more elevated when angiographically confirmed vasospasm was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiographical and histological responses of the basilar artery to the cisternal injection of 15-HPAA were studied in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cisternal injection of 15-HPAA (0.2 and 2.0 mg dissolved in bovine serum) caused a mild initial contraction of the basilar artery that lasted about 7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the third day, a stronger contraction occurred, persisting thereafter until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electronmicroscopy of those arterial samples revealed the disappearance of myofibrils, pyknotic changes of nuclei, and the appearance of vacuoles as well as electron-dense granules in the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prolonged arterial contraction was always associated with remarkable destruction of the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes were essentially the same as those in experimental and clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data strongly indicate that free radical reactions initiated by clot lysis, represented by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, plays an important role in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
