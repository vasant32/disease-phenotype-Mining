<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vasoconstriction has been identified as a major contributing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although increasing evidence implicates endothelin (ET)-1 in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, its role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after SAH has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to further determine the role of ET in the first minutes to hours after massive experimental SAH induced by prophylactic treatment with the ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> clazosentan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced in 22 anesthetized rats by injection of 0.5-ml arterial, nonheparinized blood into the cisterna magna over the course of 60 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probes were placed stereotactically over the cranial windows to allow online recording of cerebral blood flow (CBF) starting 30 minutes prior to SAH and continuing for 3 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group (Group A, 11 rats) received vehicle saline solution via a femoral catheter before SAH, and a second group (Group B, 11 rats) was treated prophylactically with clazosentan, an ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was started 30 minutes prior to bolus injection (1 mg/kg body weight), immediately followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg body weight/hr until the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction of SAH in the rats caused an immediate increase in ICP, which led to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perfusion, as measured with LDF, was found to have decreased relative to baseline by 30 +/-20% in the control group and 20 +/-9% in the clazosentan-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure and CPP recovered comparably in both groups thereafter within minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Control animals demonstrated prolonged hypoperfusion with a loss of autoregulation independent of CPP changes, finally approaching 80% of baseline values toward the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors observed that clazosentan did not influence peracute CPP-dependent hypoperfusion, but prevented continuous CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry perfusion readings remained depressed in control animals at 73 +/-19% of baseline in comparison with 106 +/-25% of baseline in clazosentan-treated animals (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first hours after a massive experimental SAH can be characterized by a CPP-independent compromise in cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment with the ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> clazosentan prevented hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is known that in the first days after SAH, a reduction in CBF correlates clinically to high-grade SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although research currently focuses on delayed vasospasm, administration of vasoactive drugs in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of SAH may reverse perfusion deficits and improve patient recovery </plain></SENT>
