<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> derived from subarachnoid blood clots might be a prime candidate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, cisternal bloody cerebrospinal fluid (bCSF) was collected from SAH patients four and seven days after aneurysmal rupture, and the effects of bCSF on the cell growth and intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) dynamics were investigated in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF collected from patients undergoing other intracranial surgeries was used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with bCSF4 significantly facilitated cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in the cultured endothelial cells, and significantly enhanced <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i increase, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of the bCSF elicited no [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with interleukin-1 beta showed a similar significant enhancement of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response, while pre-treatment with high concentrations of serum or interleukin-6 did not change the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that bCSF collected from SAH patients contains some substances which enhance endothelial cell proliferation and sensitivity to inflammatory mediator </plain></SENT>
