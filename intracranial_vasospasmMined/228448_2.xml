<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the importance of adrenergic nerves in this phenomenon, high doses (600 microgram/ml) of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were used to produce in vitro chemical sympathectomy in bovine middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>6-OHDA reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> fluorescence to undectable limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>H3-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> re-uptake was reduced to 1.5% of intact controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> content was reduced by 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, and fresh human whole blood were modestly reduced after denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reduction was probably due to alpha receptor inactivation by 6-OHDA, because after protection of the alpha receptors with phentolamine the vessel response was the same as in untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contractions in response to aged human whole blood were not affected by denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the endogenous release of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> does not play a major role in the initiation or spread of blood-induced vasospasm in large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
