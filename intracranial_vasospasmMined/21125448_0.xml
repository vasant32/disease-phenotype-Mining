<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: forty male New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into 5 groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: (1) control (no SAH [n = 8]), (2) SAH only (n = 8), (3) SAH plus vehicle (n = 8), (4) SAH plus nimodipine (n = 8), and (5) SAH plus flunarizine (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before sacrifice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals underwent femoral artery catheterization procedure by open surgery under anesthesia and angiography performed for each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: there was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameter and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 4 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 5 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p &lt; 0.05).Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 5 were significantly higher than in group 4 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that flunarizine has marked vasodilatatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
