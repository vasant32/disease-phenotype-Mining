<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the substantial research and clinical efforts, delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) is still the major complication after SAH and represents an important factor for severe neurological deficits </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Understanding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of different pathophysiological derangements after SAH is very important for the development of new therapies, in order to abolish secondary ischemic brain injuries early-on and improve patients' outcome </plain></SENT>
