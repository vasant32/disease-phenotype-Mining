<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects and outcome of transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) on brain tissue perfusion by using combined perfusion- and diffusion-weighted (PW/DW) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> treated using TBA were included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically relevant vasospasm was diagnosed using a standardized PW/DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography was used to confirm vasospasm, and TBA was performed to dilate vasospastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PW/DW imaging protocol was repeated after TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the passage of contrast medium after standardized application using the bolus tracking method allowed for the calculation of the time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) before and after TBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue at risk was defined based on perfusion delays in individual vessel territories compared with those in reference territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with proximal focal vasospasm, TBA could dilate spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up PW/DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging showed the disappearance of, or a decrease in, the mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A TBA-induced reduction in the perfusion delay of 6.2 +/- 1 seconds (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 1.5 +/- 0.45 seconds resulted in the complete prevention of infarction; a reduction in the delay of 6.2 +/- 2.7 to 4.1 +/- 1.9 seconds resulted in the preservation of those brain tissue parts having only small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the vessel territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Without TBA, however, the perfusion delay remained or even increased (11.1 +/- 3.7 seconds), and the complete infarction of a territory occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty of vasospastic arteries leads to hemodynamic effects that can be quantified using PW/DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases of a severe PW/DW imaging mismatch successful TBA improved tissue perfusion and prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of PW/DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and the concept of tissue at risk is shown by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in vessels not accessible by TBA </plain></SENT>
