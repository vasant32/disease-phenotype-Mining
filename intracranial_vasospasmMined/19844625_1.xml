<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate treatment, some patients deteriorate and they develop symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and clinical outcome of intraarterial nimodipine infusion on symptomatic vasospasm that is refractory to hemodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, the clinical charts and the transcranial doppler, computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography results for the patients who underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> due to aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 36 months between Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2005 and Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2007, 19 patients were identified who had undergone a total of 53 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed the difference in the arterial vessel diameter, the blood flow velocity and the clinical outcome before and after these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was observed in 42 of 53 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The velocities of the affected vessels before and after procedures were available in 33 of 53 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine procedures exhibited a mean decrease of 84.1 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed clinical improvement and an improved level of consciousness with an improved GCS score after 23 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the use of intraarterial nimodipine is effective and safe in selected cases of vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
