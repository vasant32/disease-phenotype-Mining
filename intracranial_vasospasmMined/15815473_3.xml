<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients are also at risk for cerebrovascular disease, but studies on the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism are few and for DO nonexistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects on DO and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> on whole brain CBF and cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO2) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CMRglc) in unanesthetized rhesus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microelectrodes and catheters inserted in the superior sagittal sinus monitored H2 clearance and sampled cerebral venous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were done at low and high doses with control measurements between doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5.10, and 15 microg/kg/min (n = 6), neither systemic nor cerebral variables were affected by either drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At doses of 50 and 100 microg/kg/min (n = 4), DO and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> increased arterial blood pressure and heart rate by 15 to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas CBF, CMRO2, and CMRglc were clearly unaffected by DO at high doses, they increased by 20-30% with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, 100 microg/kg/min and although not significant (p &gt;0.05), the consistency and magnitude of the increase along with the likelihood of a type II error led us to conclude that (a) both DO and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> are less effective in monkeys than in humans and (b) whereas DO at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses tested showed no indication of affecting CBF and CMR, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> increased CBF and CMR by 20 to 30% at a dose of 100 microg/kg/min </plain></SENT>
