<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, pharmacological treatment has been plagued in part by an inability to attain sufficiently high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> drug in the cerebrospinal fluid without precipitating systemic side effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To circumvent this limitation of current pharmacological therapy, the authors have developed a sustained-release preparation of papaverine that can be implanted intracranially at the time of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro evaluation of drug-release kinetics has demonstrated that reliable, sustained release of effective amounts of papaverine is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vitro bioassay using isolated preparations of canine basilar artery has confirmed the biological activity of this preparation </plain></SENT>
