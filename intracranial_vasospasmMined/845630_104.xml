<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-five studies of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and regional cerebral oxygen utilization (rCMRO2) were performed in 30 patients undergoing diagnostic cerebral angiography for evaluation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tracer methods employing radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> were used to measure rCBV, rCBF, and rCMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient studies were divided into groups based on their neurological status and the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, with and without vasospasm, produced significant decreases in CBF and CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, patients with more severe neurological deficits, and patients with more severe degrees of vasospasm, had a more marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of CBF and CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in CBV (to 58% above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in patients with severe neurological deficits associated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This large increase suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> consists of constriction of the large, radiographically visible extraparenchymal vessels accompained by a massive dilation of intraparenchymal vessels </plain></SENT>
