<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is one of the leading factors that deteriorate the clinical outcome after aneurysmal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) is a method to directly dilate the constricted vessel using the intravascular neurosurgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiographic, histologic, and pharmacologic evaluations related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> are presented, using a canine double-injection model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In angiographic evaluation, we studied the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> performed on day 1, 4, or 7 of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed sequential histologic study by light microscopy using the same for the angiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pharmacologic evaluation, we measured in vitro isotonic constrictive force using two vasoconstrictors immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar arteries (control group) and basilar arteries on day 7 of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In angiographic evaluation, we observed the effective dilation of spastic artery immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and saw no recurrence of vessel constriction when <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed on day 7 of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the preventive effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was inconsistent when it was performed earlier after SAH (days 1, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In histologic evaluation, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> segments immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> showed denuding of endothelial cells and stretching of the internal elastic lamina without disruption of the muscle layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In pharmacologic evaluation, there was no difference in isotonic constrictive force created by vasoconstrictors between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> segments without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was a statistically significant reduction of isotonic constrictive force on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> segment with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> vasodilation in vasospasm after SAH may result from mild functional changes in the vascular wall when <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was applied on day 7 of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The functional changes would not be adequately induced to prevent recurrence of vasoconstriction when <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was applied soon after SAH </plain></SENT>
