<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>1 The pharmacological similarity between human basilar artery and a number of isolated tissues (rat colon, anococcygeus, stomach fundus and aorta and guinea-pig ileum and colon) has been assessed during investigations of the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2 The responses of each of the six tissues to human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to human serum were compared with those of the human isolated basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3 These studies revealed the presence of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> factor in CSF from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> patients and several tissues may be of use for further work in identifying the vasoactive substances in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4 No tissue displayed exactly the same spectrum of biological reactivity as the human basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rat stomach fundus showed the closest similarity and was further studied for similarities in drug-induced responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 The rat stomach fundus, like the human basilar artery, was contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> and relaxed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> relaxed the fundus but contracted the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
