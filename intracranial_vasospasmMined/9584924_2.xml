<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may occur during vessel occlusion by temporary clips or result from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> of the definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may also compromise cerebral blood flow and is an important cause of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study addresses the need for a sensitive indicator of compromised cerebral function during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery by measuring brain tissue oxygenation and laser Doppler flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients were studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had ruptured middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue oxygenation measurements were made with a closed polarographic sensor placed in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A laser Doppler flow probe and intracranial pressure monitor were similarly placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data were simultaneously processed using multimodality recording monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The monitoring was continued during the post-operative period and totalled over 190 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed as specific events and as trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial tissue oxygen levels were low but improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases as the intracranial pressure was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was independent of the cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flow provided an indicator of compromised brain function and tissue oxygenation an indicator of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
