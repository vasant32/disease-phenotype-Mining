<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the vasorelaxing mechanism of hydroxyfasudil, a hydroxylated metabolite of fasudil <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, was determined in the rabbit basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of hydroxyfasudil on tension, intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i), and phosphorylation of the myosin light chain were examined using the isolated and intact or permeabilized rabbit basilar artery without endothelium in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the intact rabbit basilar artery, hydroxyfasudil elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of the artery precontracted with 1 nmol/L endothelin-1 (ET-1) plus 20 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> without any significant decrease in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i as determined by fura-2 microfluorometry (IC50: 5.1 +/- 4.6 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relaxation induced by hydroxyfasudil was accompanied with dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the permeabilized preparation, hydroxyfasudil inhibited the contraction induced by ET-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), or the catalytic subunit of rho-associated kinase, but it did not inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-induced contraction under the condition of inhibited myosin light chain phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hydroxyfasudil showed a greater relaxant effect under decreased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study indicated that hydroxyfasudil relaxes the rabbit basilar artery mainly by disinhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase through the inhibition of rho-associated kinase and that this effect depends on the intracellular ATP concentration </plain></SENT>
