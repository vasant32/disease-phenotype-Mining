<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a unique role in many physiological stress processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a total of 48 rabbits were assigned randomly to four groups: control group, SAH day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals in SAH day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the Nrf2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Nrf2 were also determined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on days 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The elevated expression of Nrf2 was detected after SAH and peaked on days 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nrf2 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit experimental model of SAH </plain></SENT>
