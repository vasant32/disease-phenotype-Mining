<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent publications have investigated the possibility that microsurgical fenestration of the lamina terminalis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery may reduce the incidence of shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed a single-surgeon series to compare postsurgical outcomes of patients who underwent fenestration of the lamina terminalis against those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the medical records of 369 consecutive patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> admitted to Columbia University Medical Center between January 2000 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent craniotomy and clipping of at least one ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> by a single neurosurgeon (ESC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidences of shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, conversion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> on admission to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were compared in patients who underwent fenestration of the lamina terminalis with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient cohort was thus divided into three subgroups: 1) patients whose operative records clearly indicated that they underwent fenestration of the lamina terminalis, 2) patients whose operative records clearly indicated that they did not undergo fenestration of the lamina terminalis, and 3) patients whose operative records did not indicate one way or another whether they received fenestration of the lamina terminalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We performed two separate analyses by comparing the postsurgical outcomes in those patients who were fenestrated versus those who were definitively not fenestrated and comparing the postsurgical outcomes in those patients who were fenestrated versus those who were not plus those whose records did not document fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To further control for any cohort differences, we performed a comparison between patients who were fenestrated and those who were not after matching 1:1 for presenting radiographic and clinical characteristics predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared using logistic regression and multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first model, fenestrated patients had a shunt rate, conversion rate, and rate of clinical vasospasm of 25, 50, and 23%, respectively, versus 20, 27, and 27% in nonfenestrated patients, respectively (P = 0.28, 0.21, and 0.32, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the second model, the nonfenestrated patients plus nondocumented patients had a shunt rate, conversion rate, and rate of clinical vasospasm of 16, 40, and 20%, respectively (P = 0.19, 0.33, and 0.60, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the matched cohort, fenestrated patients had a shunt rate, conversion rate, and rate of clinical vasospasm of 29, 67, and 20%, respectively, versus 20, 25, and 25% in nonfenestrated patients, respectively (P = 0.30, 0.24, and 0.20, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast to other retrospective multisurgeon series, our retrospective single-surgeon series suggests that microsurgical fenestration of the lamina terminalis may not reduce the incidence of shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A prospective multicenter trial is needed to definitively address the use of this maneuver </plain></SENT>
