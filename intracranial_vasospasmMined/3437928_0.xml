<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological grades of these patients were grade III in 2 and grade IV in 4 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> on CT was diffuse and thick in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was continuously measured for 7 to 19 days by the thermal diffusion flow probe with a peltier stack which was left on the cerebral cortex at the surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CBF studies by cold <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT and 133Xe inhalation methods were also performed in discussing cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time intracranial pressure was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except for 2 patients who died due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial CBF value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 20 to 40 ml/100 g/min (mean value: 27 ml/100 g/min), and these were significantly low compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value (50 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these CBF was substantially decreased several days after surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and it was marked in 3 patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these results it was clear that the degree of vasospasm is important to determine the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of 3 patients who died had ruptured left posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> with occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case further decrease of CBF due to vasospasm was observed in addition to low initial CBF resulting diffuse low flow in both hemispheres although extracranial to intracranial bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it was also shown that the intracranial pressure was an important factor to influence the outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
