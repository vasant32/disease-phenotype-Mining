<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), as measured by a bioassay method, was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relaxation to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in preparations without endothelium was smaller in the spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Production of cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>, measured by radioimmunoassay, was reduced in the spastic arteries; the impaired production was accompanied by decrease in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>, the substrate for the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contents of other high-energy phosphates, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate and ATP were also markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Close temporal correlation between the metabolic failure and development of vasospasm was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sarcolemmal regulation of intracellular calcium concentration was impaired in the pathological condition, suggesting a link between the metabolic failure and the pathological protracted contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic changes, and resultant affected viability of smooth muscle cells are likely to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
