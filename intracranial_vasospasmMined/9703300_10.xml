<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnostic evaluation and the clinical course of patients with pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of a consecutive series of patients with a pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> encountered at Mayo Clinic Rochester during a 6-year interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical manifestations, the neuroimaging characteristics, and the appropriate management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 15 male and 9 female patients with a pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> ranged from 3 to 72 years of age (median, 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients, 18 had a sudden explosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> at the time of initial assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular shunting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was indicated in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that the center of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was prepontine, and it extended into the interpeduncular or premedullary cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients, a small focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was not noted on an admission computed tomographic scan but was identified on repeated study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second four-vessel cerebral angiogram, obtained in most patients, showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in four patients who had had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on the first study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient, moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was found on the second angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a family history of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The excellent outcome in patients with pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is in distinct contrast to the overall somber outcome associated with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the posterior circulation may mimic a pretruncal nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and should be excluded on the basis of a technically satisfactory cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
