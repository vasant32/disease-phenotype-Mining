<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients were excluded prior to receiving any study drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 897 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 300 received a placebo containing a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> vehicle, 298 received 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad, and 299 received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> administered intravenously beginning within 48 hours of the SAH and continuing through 10 days posthemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were also treated with orally administered nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 3 months post-SAH, there were no significant differences (p &lt; 0.025) among the groups with regard to mortality rate, favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, or employment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 14 days after the SAH, there were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or severity of clinically symptomatic or angiographically identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality data stratified by gender and neurological grade on admission (assessed according to a modified World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale) demonstrated that the men with Grades IV to V had a 33% mortality rate in the vehicle group, 52% in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.29), and 5% in the 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tirilazad was well tolerated at both dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tirilazad mesylate at dosage levels of up to 6 mg/kg per day for 8 to 10 days following SAH did not improve the overall outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in the efficacy of tirilazad in this trial and a previously reported trial in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, in which dosage levels of tirilazad of 6 mg/kg per day reduced mortality rates and increased good recovery, may be a result of differences in admission characteristics of the patients and/or differences in management protocols, including the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
