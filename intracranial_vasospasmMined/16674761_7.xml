<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of vasospasm in relation to the development of reversible or irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> among patients with primary TCH has never been fully addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper includes a report on a 51-year-old woman with primary TCH complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> and a literature review of 16 further patients with the same illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their magnetic resonance or conventional angiographic findings were clearly described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our review found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these 17 patients showed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven (65%) of them developed permanent ischaemic infarctions, almost exclusively located at the watershed zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the presence of vasospasm might be requisite for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> as well as for permanent infarctions in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, searching for any clue of vasospasm is mandatory in treatment of patients with primary TCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absence of an accompanying vasospasm might predict a good outcome </plain></SENT>
