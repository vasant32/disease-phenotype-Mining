<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This vasospasm probably results from an imbalance among vasoactive factors released from both the clot formed by extravasated blood and adjacent tissues, and in particular from a decrease in the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> is also known to elevate brain production and deposition of beta-amyloid, and to induce a delayed increase in total NO synthase (NOS) activity due to induction of expression of so-called induced NOS isoform, phenomena that may secondarily contribute to SAH-related brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treatment with the intracellular NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15429">hydroxylamine</z:chebi> on: (i) basilar arterial wall that remained in a direct contact with the clot, (ii) formation of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP), (iii) total brain NOS activity, and (iv) neurological outcome in a 'two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>' rat SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 0.18 mmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15429">hydroxylamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (12.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 7 days beginning immediately after the first '<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>' (intracisternal blood injection) reduced basilar arterial wall damage and attenuated post-SAH neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also reduced the SAH-related increases in hippocampal and cortical beta-APP immunoreactivities and hippocampal NOS activity measured 24 h after commencement of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that intracellular NO donors that yield NO through the action of widely distributed enzymes in brain cells (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochromes</z:chebi>, catalase) can attenuate detrimental effects of SAH </plain></SENT>
