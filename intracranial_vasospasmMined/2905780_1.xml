<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There have been reports that superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCG) is effective as a treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, denervation supersensitivity is supposed to play an important role in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two accounts contradict each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate this problem, various examinations were performed using the exposed basilar arteries of cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have accepted that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> (Oxy-Hb) is an important spasmogenic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the change in vascular reactivity to Oxy-Hb was investigated after various kinds of denervations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that Oxy-Hb has no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonist</z:chebi> properties because the Oxy-Hb inducing vasospasm was not suppressed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> or phenoxybenzamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result of this, it is not likely that augmentation of Oxy-Hb inducing vasospasm is caused by deviation supersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the non-deviation supersensitivity became a topic of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were denervated by chemical treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi>, 6-hydroxydopamine) or bilateral SCG to examine the change in the reactivity to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> or Oxy-Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in reactivity to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> was observed with the denervations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no change in reactivity to Oxy-Hb was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was observed that deviation and non-deviation supersensitivity do not participate in vasospasm, in so far as vasospasm is caused by Oxy-Hb </plain></SENT>
