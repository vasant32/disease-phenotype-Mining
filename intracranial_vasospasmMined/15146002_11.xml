<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and permanent disability after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether the method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment plays an important role in determining the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and its clinical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Admission data, cranial computed tomography (CT), treatment details, transcranial Doppler (TCD) results, and clinical outcomes of patients who had surgical or endovascular management of their ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were recorded and subject to multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 1995 and December 1999, 292 eligible patients (206 female, 86 male) had definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment at our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>212 patients were clipped, 80 coiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in patient age, pre-treatment neurological grade, Fisher grade, or timing of treatment in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>48.3% patients developed TCD detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and 16.1% patients developed permanent ischaemic neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At clinical follow up, 84.2% of patients were well (mGOS 1 and 2) with a cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 6.5% from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only significant predictor of TCD-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was patient age (inversely, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased patient age, vasospasm, poor pre-treatment WFNS, and higher CT Fisher grades correlated with a poor discharge GOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, only poor pre-treatment WFNS grade and patient age correlated with poor GOS at follow up (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The treatment method had no influence on the incidence or duration of TCD detected vasospasm and there was no significant difference in outcome at discharge or follow up between those patients who had surgery or endovascular management of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
