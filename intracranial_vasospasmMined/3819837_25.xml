<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of complete clot removal 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated in monkeys in a blind randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four monkeys were randomized to one of three groups to undergo sham-operation (sham-operated group), clot placement only (clot group), or clot placement and removal (clot-removal group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By means of standard microsurgical techniques, the major cerebral vessels bilaterally were dissected free of arachnoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An autologous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> averaging 5 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid spaces in the clot and clot-removal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saline solution was instilled in the subarachnoid spaces of the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent reoperation 24 hours after the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the clot-removal group, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was evacuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the sham-operated and clot groups, the incision was simply closed again after 3 hours of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indices monitored before and 7 days after SAH induction included neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); representative animals were evaluated with computerized tomography (CT) brain scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological deficits in either the sham-operated or the clot-removal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One animal in the clot group developed a progressive delayed ischemic deficit on Day 5 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A second animal in this group died suddenly on Day 4 post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An autopsy revealed a recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of the superior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings correlated with MRI and CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Significant vasospasm (25% to 100% reduction in vessel caliber) was present on Day 7 in 100% of the clot animals (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no significant vasospasm (p greater than 0.05) on Day 7 in either the sham-operated or the clot-removal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A large volume of clot placed bilaterally resulted in a 25% incidence of delayed ischemic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Evacuation of subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> within 24 hours of SAH prevented the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit in the primate model </plain></SENT>
