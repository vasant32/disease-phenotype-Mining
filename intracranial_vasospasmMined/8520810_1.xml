<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 48 consecutive patients receiving high-dose diltiazem (5 micrograms/kg/min) injection combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> to late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients underwent surgery within 72 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem was continuously given via a central venous line for up to 2 weeks in conjunction with simple cisternal drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> solution (500 ml/day) was infused for 7-10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">Hydrocortisone</z:chebi> was given 1,600 mg on the first day, then the dose was gradually decreased over 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm (SVS) occurred in 5 patients (10.4%), 4 patients recovered, but 1 had severe neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A low density area on CT-scan was observed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (62.5%) had good recovery, 10 patients (20.8%) had moderate disability, 3 (6.3%) had severe disability and 3 (6.3%) had vegetative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of the initial brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no severely hypotensive side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, 3 patients showed atrioventricular blockage on electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These side effects subsided after the dose of the drug was decreased or administration was stopped altogether </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings show that high-dose calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> diltiazem therapy combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> injection is safe and effective for prevention of late cerebral symptomatic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
