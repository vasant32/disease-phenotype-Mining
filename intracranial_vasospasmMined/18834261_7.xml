<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of intracisternal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> solution on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a canine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced in 10 beagles using the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography of the vertebrobasilar artery was performed on Day 1 (baseline values before SAH) and on Day 7 (during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after induced SAH) before and after intracisternal injection of 0.5 ml/kg of 15 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> solution into the cerebellomedullary cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cerebrospinal fluid Mg++ concentration was significantly increased to 3.15 +/- 1.14 mEq/L after intracisternal injection from the preinjection value (1.45 +/- 0.09 mEq/L; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameters of the basilar artery, vertebral artery, and superior cerebellar artery on Day 7 were significantly decreased to 58.0 +/- 10.9%, 71.0 +/- 10.1%, and 60.9 +/- 13.8%, respectively, of their baseline diameters on Day 1 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>, these diameters significantly increased to 73.8 +/- 14.3%, 83.0 +/- 14.8%, and 74.1 +/- 13.5%, respectively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracisternal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> solution causes significant dilation of spastic cerebral arteries in the canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH </plain></SENT>
