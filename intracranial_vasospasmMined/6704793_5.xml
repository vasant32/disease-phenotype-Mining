<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in the internal diameter of the basilar artery were determined by measuring the blood column diameter from photomicrographs taken sequentially, at 5 minute intervals, through the operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood vessel diameter are expressed as a plus or minus percentage of the pretreatment diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure and blood gas values were kept in the physiological range for the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subarachnoid injection of PRP-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> produced severe constriction of the basilar artery (mean constriction at 5 minutes after injection: -40.7% +/- 2.8 SEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet-free plasma, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> alone and Elliott's A solution had no spasmogenic effect when injected into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This spasmolytic effect persisted in a decremental fashion for the 60 minute period of observation, by which time the previously constricted vessel had returned to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the platelet fraction of whole blood may be involved in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vasospasm following subarachnoid hemmorrhage and that this phenomenon can be readily reversed by calcium antagonism </plain></SENT>
