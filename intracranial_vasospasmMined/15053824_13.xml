<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested the involvement of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of AVP in the arterial narrowing following cerebral haemorrhage by examining the effect of SR 49059 (a V(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) on the diameter of rat basilar artery exposed to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> ZM 230487 on AVP-induced contraction of rat basilar arteries was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 h and 2 days from SAH induction, brains were removed and pictures of the basilar arteries were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The external diameter of the basilar artery was measured in the presence and absence of SR 49059 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For in vitro experiments, the basilar arteries isolated from control and SAH rats (at 1 h and at 2 days from SAH induction) were cut into spiral preparations and the AVP (0.3 nmol/L)-induced contraction in the presence of ZM 230487 was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each group analysed (i.e. control, SAH 1 h and SAH 2 days) consisted of eight rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diameter of rat basilar arteries decreased by 43 and 25% at 1 h and 2 days from SAH induction, respectively, compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The administration of SR 49059 significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After SAH induction, the diameter of the basilar artery in SR 49059-treated groups decreased by only 22% (at 1 h) and by 3% (at 2 days) compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In basilar arterial strips, ZM 230487 attenuated the vasopressin-induced contraction in both control and SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, SAH groups showed a significant resistance of the AVP-induced contraction in the presence of ZM 230487 compared with control (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in SAH rats is due, at least in part, to endogenous AVP and may involve an increase in the activity of 5-lipoxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>SR 49059 may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
