<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clazosentan, a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelinreceptor antagonist</z:chebi>, has been suggested to help reduce the incidence of vasospasm in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the results were controversial in previous trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis attempts to assess the effect of clazosentan in patients with aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception until June, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to the effect of clazosentan in aSAH were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes included the incidence of angiographic vasospasm, new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (NCI), delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND), and vasospasm-related morbidity/mortality (M/M); the second outcomes included the occurrence of rescue therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause-mortality, and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 RCTs were included with a total of 2156 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of angiographic vasospasm (relative risk [RR]â€Š=0.58; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.71), DIND (RR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.92), and vasospasm-related M/M (RR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.96) were statistically significantly reduced in the clazosentan group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with clazosentan had a reduced occurrence of rescue therapy (RR=0.62; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no statistically significant effects were observed in NCI (RR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.04), mortality (RR=1.03; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.49), and poor outcome (RR=1.12; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our pooling data supports that clazosentan is probably effective in preventing the occurrence of angiographic vasospasm, vasospasm-related DIND, vasospasm related M/M, and rescue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence lends significant supports to the benefits of clazosentan in decreasing the occurrence of NCI, mortality or improving the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
