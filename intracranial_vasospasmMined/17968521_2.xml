<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> CT within 48 h of the ictus was predictive of developing CV with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective study from 1999 to 2006 of 97 patients with aSAH who underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> CT within 48 h of their bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and angiographic parameters were investigated as potential risk factors for the development of CV with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of this endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 97 patients with a mean age of 54 +/- 12 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 78 (80.4%) patients presented with a Fisher grade of 3 and 51 (52.6%) patients with a Hunt Hess score &gt;or=3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CV with infarction was found in 33 (34%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate modeling, younger patients with a Fisher scale of 3 or a reduced ipsilateral mean hemispheric CBF had an association with developing CV with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In binary logistic regression modeling, patients with lower initial hemispheric CBF's were at a significant risk of CV with infarction in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower initial CBF at presentation is a risk factor for developing CV with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may help in early prediction of this entity and may have therapeutic implications in the future </plain></SENT>
