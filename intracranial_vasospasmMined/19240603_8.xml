<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is induced by free radicals released from a subarachnoid clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study therefore investigated the effect of a new free radical scavenger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>, in the treatment of patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-one patients with aneurysmal SAH participated in this study and were randomized into a control group (n = 42) and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference between the 2 groups in terms of incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by vasospasm, and Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 3 months after SAH were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of DINDs was 21% in the control group and 10% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group, yet there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with DINDs, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by vasospasm was 66% in the control group and 0% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group (P = 0.028), whereas the incidence of poor outcome caused by vasospasm was 71% in the control group and 0% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found a trend toward a lesser incidence of DINDs and a lesser incidence of poor outcome caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It might therefore be suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> is a useful agent for the treatment of aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
