<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For at least 3 weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 80 subjects underwent very close follow-up with clinical examination and transcranial Doppler records of the blood velocities within the basal cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Firstly a correlation between measured maximal mean blood flow velocities and age was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, according to their age and the maximum of recorded mean velocities (v), the patients were divided into groups as follows: age 55 years or less, age more than 55 years; and maximum velocity v1 &lt; 90 cm/s, 90 cm/s &lt; v2 &lt; 120 cm/s, 120 cm/s &lt; v3 &lt; 160 cm/s, v4 &gt; 160 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation of the measured maximum mean velocities and the age of the patients (r = -0.525, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the velocity groups there was a significant (chi-squared statistic for contingency tables, p &lt; 0.01) difference between both age-groups: 32% (n = 18) of the younger fell into group v4 with maximum mean velocities of more than 160 cm/s, but none of the older had such </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vice versa, 63% (n = 15) of the older compared with only 14% (n = 8) of the younger fell into group v1 with maximum mean velocities of less than 90 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up also depicted differences between both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13 of 18 younger patients with maximum mean velocities &gt; 160 cm/s exhibited symptomatic vasospasm with a delayed neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This typical course did not occur in the older age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
