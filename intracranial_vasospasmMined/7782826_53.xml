<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The continuous release of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is required to maintain basal cerebrovascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, a putative spasmogen, rapidly binds NO, implicating loss of NO in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If vasospasm is mediated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of NO in the vessel wall, it should be reversible by replacement with NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis, the authors placed blood clots around the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) of four cynomolgus monkeys; four unoperated animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arteriography was performed before and 7 days after surgery to assess the presence and degree of vasospasm, which was quantified in the anteroposterior (AP) projection by computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the distribution of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was measured during four to six runs in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) of brief infusions of saline followed by NO solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arteriography was performed immediately after completing the final NO infusion in three of the four animals with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow velocities were obtained using transcranial Doppler before, during, and after NO infusion in two vasospastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After ICA NO infusion, arteriographic vasospasm resolved (mean percent of preoperative AP area, 55.9%); that is, the AP areas of the proximal portion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> returned to their preoperative values (mean 91.4%; range 88%-96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to ICA saline, during ICA NO infusion CBF increased 7% in control animals and 19% in vasospastic animals (p &lt; 0.002) without significant changes in other physiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During NO infusion, peak systolic right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> CBF velocity decreased (130 to 109 cm/sec and 116 to 76 cm/sec) in two vasospastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects of ICA NO on CBF and CBF velocity disappeared shortly after terminating NO infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid infusion of NO in a primate model of vasospasm 1) increases CBF, 2) decreases cerebral vascular resistance, 3) reverses arteriographic vasospasm, and 4) decreases CBF velocity in the vasospastic artery without producing systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the potential for the development of targeted therapy to reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
