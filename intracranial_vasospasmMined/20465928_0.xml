<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2004, eight consecutive WFNS grade 5 patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (15~23 mm) were treated with endovascular coil embolization within two days and followed for at least 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were three middle cerebral and five internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patients were treated by craniotomy and none survived without treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were initially neck remnant developed body filling due to coil compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two were re-treated with coils at six and 12 months and resulted in neck remnant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular coil embolization can be selected at an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with poor-grade SAH without intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> even if the aneur-ysm is large </plain></SENT>
