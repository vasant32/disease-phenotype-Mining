<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relaxation of this spasm occurs when the intracellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> levels are raised, resulting in sequestration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> by the vascular smooth muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
