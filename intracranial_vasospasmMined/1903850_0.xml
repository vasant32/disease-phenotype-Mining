<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So the authors are now using GTN for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>125 patients classified as Fisher's Group 2, 3 or 4 were operated on within 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>58 patients (GTN group) were treated with continuous intravenous infusions of GTN (0.5-1.0 micrograms/kg/min) for about 2 weeks after their operation, and another 67 patients (control group) were not administered GTN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm decreased in each GTN group of Fisher's classification, and the severity of angiographic vasospasm also tended to decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> classified as CT group 3 or 4, symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 11 patients (30.6%) in the GTN group, but in 26 patients (63.4%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the outcome, 10 patients (17.2%) in the GTN group showed poor results or died, as opposed to 22 patients (32.9%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover the GTN group had no cases of mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that GTN can be effective for prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and improve the prognosis in patients with serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
