<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature of cases of vasospasm following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection and to discuss possible etiologies, diagnosis and management of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was performed using relevant search key words to identify cases of '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>' as a complication following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant cross references were added by manually searching the references of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 56 patients in our initial search but only 40 cases matched our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Pituitary tumors</z:e> and sellar area were the most common pathologies and location associated with this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average time interval to development of symptomatic vasospasm was 8 days and mortality was high (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common encountered causative factors were vascular factors (vessel encasement, displacement and narrowing) and presence of blood in the basal cisterns in postoperative scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e>' after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection is a rare but challenging complication with very high morbidity and mortality in reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm following <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> surgery shares some of the same clinical variables (time interval, causative factors, morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates) of vasospasm after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis and prompt management which are key elements of final outcome </plain></SENT>
