<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the present study, the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and the ability of recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) to augment this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> mechanism in the spastic arteries were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recombinant adenoviral vectors (10(9) plaque-forming units per animal) encoding genes for human Epo (AdEpo), and beta-galactosidase were injected immediately after injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna (day 0) of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed on day 0 and day 2, and basilar arteries were harvested for Western blots, measurement of cGMP levels, and analysis of vasomotor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Injection of autologous arterial blood into cisterna magna resulted in significant vasospasm of the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the narrowing of arterial diameter and reduced expression of eNOS, expressions of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphorylated eNOS were significantly increased in spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene transfer of AdEpo reversed the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AdEpo-transduced basilar arteries demonstrated significant augmentation of the endothelium-dependent relaxations to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, whereas the relaxations to an NO donor, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate-2-<z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="26714">sodium salt</z:chebi>, were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transduction with AdEpo further increased the expression of phosphorylated Akt and eNOS and elevated basal levels of cGMP in the spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phosphorylation of eNOS appears to be an adaptive mechanism activated during development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vascular protective effect of Epo against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induced by SAH may be mediated in part by phosphorylation of Akt/eNOS </plain></SENT>
