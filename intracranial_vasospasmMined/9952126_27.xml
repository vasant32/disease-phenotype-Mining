<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial papaverine (IAP) has been described as a treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> refractory to standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a series of 15 consecutive patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in which IAP was employed for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> on stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computerized tomography cerebral blood flow studies, and angiographically defined arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Papaverine was infused into 32 arteries on 23 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients required multiple treatments between 1 and 8 days apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five instances, IAP was combined with angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographically defined vasospasm was at least partially reversed immediately following treatment on 18 of 23 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associated clinical improvement was major on 6 occasions, and either minor or none on 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment cerebral blood flow was assessed on 13 occasions and showed improvement in previously ischemic areas on six occasions and no improvement on seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were encountered on four occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and transient brain-stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were seen with vertebral artery infusions; a generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and paradoxical aggravation of vasospasm resulting in hemispheric infarction occurred with internal carotid artery infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial papaverine resulted in reversal of arterial narrowing in the majority of cases (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this angiographic improvement was associated with cerebral blood flow augmentation in only 46% of cases analyzed, and major clinical improvement in 26% </plain></SENT>
