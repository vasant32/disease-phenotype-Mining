<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory transcranial signals were not found in 2.7% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with angiography, the accuracy of transcranial criteria in assessing collateral flow over the circle of Willis was 94 and 88% for anterior and posterior circulation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method also appeared very promising for detection of lesions of the intracranial arteries although the number of such cases with angiographic verification was limited in the present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, an incidence of 93% arterial narrowing in basal cerebral arteries was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on angiography also showed arterial narrowing with an incidence of 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was possible to monitor the time course and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>Arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> were characterized by Doppler findings of high velocities and low pulsatilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These lesions were diagnosed with an accuracy of 95% </plain></SENT>
