<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the contractions was closely related to the number of thrombin Units studied rather than to the amount of protein added to the isolation bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombin had a much slower <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action, but was more potent in generating sustained contractions than either <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in contrast to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, the contractions caused by thrombin were not terminated by equivalent washing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thrombin-induced contractions were significantly inhibited by prostacyclin, meclofenamic acid, phenoxybenzamine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin was the most potent of these inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that thrombin in a "free" form may cause vasoconstriction, in addition to platelet aggregation, in hemostasis and could contribute to the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
