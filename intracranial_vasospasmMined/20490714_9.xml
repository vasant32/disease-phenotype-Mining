<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic augmentation by increasing cardiac output with dobutamine (DOB) is believed to be a useful method of elevating decreased cerebral blood flow in the territory affected by vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described the clinical utility of uncalibrated radial artery-based pulse contour cardiac output (APCO) and near-infrared spectroscopy regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) monitoring for reversing vasospasm symptoms with DOB-induced hyperdynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven consecutive patients who underwent surgical clipping within 24 h of SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and subsequently developed delayed ischemic neurological deficits attributable to vasospasm were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were treated with DOB administered at a dose of 3 μg/kg/min and then increased in 3 μg/kg/min increments until resolution of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous APCO and rSO(2) measurements in conjunction with the assessment of clinical courses and outcomes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In spasm-affected territories, decreased and/or fluctuating rSO(2) was detected at baseline compared with recordings in other brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who exhibited rapid elevation of APCO in response to an incremental dose of DOB had subsequent uptake and stabilization of rSO(2) followed by improvement of vasospasm-related clinical symptoms with a maximal dose of DOB, resulted in favorable functional outcomes thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A fairly strong relationship was found between peak APCO slope and rSO(2) elevation, with a significantly high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve predicting neurological improvement with DOB treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical experience indicates that integrative monitoring with APCO and rSO(2) may provide continuous, real-time, and clinically relevant information on the effectiveness of medical treatment of distal vessel vasospasm </plain></SENT>
