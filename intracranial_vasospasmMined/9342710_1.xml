<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the feasibility of intrathecal indwelling catheters in the preparation of a repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model in dogs, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intrathecal administration of therapeutic agents against the ensuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Briefly, through a small suboccipital incision, two catheters were introduced into the subarachnoid space so that their tips were positioned in the prepontine cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was used to induce SAH by infusing autologous blood, and the other to administer pharmacological agents (saline and/or saline containing a dye in this study) by means of an osmotic pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was followed by angiography via the catheter placed in the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The obtained results show: i) the injected blood effectively formed a subarachnoid clot in the prepontine cistern, invariably leading to the occurrence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> of the basilar artery; ii) the fluid injected by the osmotic pump was evenly distributed in the cisterns around the brain stem; iii) on post mortem pathological examination, no injury of the brain or the major arteries ascribable to the placement of catheters was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present model is considered to be useful for both the investigation of pathophysiology and therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH, to be more favorable from the standpoint of animal protection, and more convenient and reliable than those used until now </plain></SENT>
