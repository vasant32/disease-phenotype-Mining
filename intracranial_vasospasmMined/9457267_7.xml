<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to provide more insight into the nature of vasospastic reactions in response to surgical manipulation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients who underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy for medically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> using the transsylvian approach were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) was used for examination of blood flow velocities within the basal cerebral arteries before and after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three types of vascular reactions were observed: 1) No or only minimal reaction with increase of the blood flow velocities less than 50% as compared with the preoperative baseline values (N = 4); 2) Ipsilateral/bilateral increase of the blood flow velocities more than 50% of the baselines (N = 14); 3) Paradoxic reactions such as early postoperative resistance flow and contralateral rise of the blood flow velocities (N = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no morbidity or mortality in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The transsylvian approach is associated with significant changes in hemodynamics--partially caused by mechanical manipulation and partially by the degradation of blood--although the risk of neurological deterioration seems to be low </plain></SENT>
