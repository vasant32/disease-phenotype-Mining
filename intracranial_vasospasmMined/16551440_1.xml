<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Changes in systemic arterial blood pressure and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were investigated in 125 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Systemic arterial blood pressure was measured every 2 hours in each patient for a period of more than 2 weeks, and a fall in systemic blood pressure (FBP) was defined as a decrease of &gt;40 mmHg of systolic blood pressure between two consecutive measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 91 FBPs occurred in 52 (41.6%) of 125 patients despite specific post-operative management to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five (5.5%) of the 91 FBPs occurred just before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was observed in 36 (69.2%) of 52 patients with FBP and in 32 (43.8%) of 73 patients without FBP (p&lt;0.01, chi-squared test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hypodense area on computed tomographic scans in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was observed in 25 (48.1%) of 52 patients with FBP and in 21 (28.8%) of 73 patients without FBP (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We conclude that FBP might result from delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> owing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> itself </plain></SENT>
