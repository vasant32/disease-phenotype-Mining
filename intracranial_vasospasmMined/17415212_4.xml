<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Local intra-arterial infusions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and nicardipine have been used to treat human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few reports of early clinical experience with these medications are currently available, and limited data are available regarding their cerebral physiological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy of intracarotid administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and nicardipine on augmenting cerebral blood flow of New Zealand White rabbits and compared the ability of these drugs with reverse topical endothelin (ET)-1-triggered vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the first group of New Zealand white rabbits, cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler) and systemic hemodynamic measurements were recorded at baseline and with increasing intracarotid doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second group, topical ET-1 (10(-4) mol/L) was applied in an acutely implanted cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose responses to nonspecific reversal of ET-1-induced vasospasm were evaluated with intra-arterially administered nicardipine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dose-response studies revealed that intracarotid administration of nicardipine, compared with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, was more effective in augmenting cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topical ET-1-induced vasospasm was completely reversed by nicardipine and partially reversed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that intra-arterially administered nicardipine is a more potent cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and is superior to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> for treating ET-1-induced experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and supports further investigation of these agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
