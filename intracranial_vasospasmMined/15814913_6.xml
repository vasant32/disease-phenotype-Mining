<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The index of mean blood flow velocity (V) in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) divided by respective velocity in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), or V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index, is commonly used as a marker of vasospasm, although reference values are not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to provide reference data for these velocities and index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial color-coded duplex and carotid duplex sonography was performed in 335 healthy volunteers (211 women, 124 men; mean age +/- SD, 42 +/- 18 years; range, 18-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age analyses were based on three groups: I, &lt;40; II, 40-60; and III, &gt;60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index was calculated based on angle-corrected blood flow velocities determined in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and extracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean flow velocities in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ICA diminished with increasing age, most pronounced in those subjects &gt;40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index increased significantly (1.67 + 0.005 [age]; P &lt; .05) with age in women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, reference values and ranges for the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index were as follows, by group: I, 1.82 (range, 0.88-2.68); II, 1.91 (range, 0.94-2.88); and III, 2.06 (range, 0.59-3.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Respective values for men were as follows, by group: I, 2.10 (range, 0.96-3.24); II, 2.04 (range, 0.71-3.37); and III, 1.78 (range, 0.81-2.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subjects &lt;40 years, the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index was significantly higher in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index significantly varies with age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sonographic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> should be based on age- and sex-adjusted reference values of the V(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>)/V(ICA) index </plain></SENT>
