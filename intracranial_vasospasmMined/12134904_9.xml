<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to explore whether a delayed treatment with adenovirus encoding the prepro-calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP), 2 days after initial blood injection, reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of severe vasospasm in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 20 dogs, arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna on Days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the second blood injection, the animals received either adenovirus encoding the prepro-CGRP gene (AdCMVCGRP-treated group, eight dogs) or adenovirus encoding the beta-galactosidase gene (AdCMVbeta <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>-treated group, six dogs) under the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group of dogs did not receive treatment and served as controls (control SAH group, six dogs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Days 0 and 7 to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Day 7 following angiography, the animals were killed and their brains were stained with X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> to detect the distribution of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also tested for CGRP immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm was observed in control SAH dogs on Day 7, and the mean basilar artery (BA) diameter was 53.4 +/- 5.5% of the value measured on Day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with AdCMVbeta <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> did not alter vasospasm (the BA diameter was 55 +/- 3.9% of that measured on Day 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The leptomeninges and adventitia of the BAs of dogs treated using AdCMVbeta <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> demonstrated positive staining with X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High levels of CGRP were measured in CSF from dogs that received AdCMVCGRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with AdCMVCGRP, vasospasm was significantly reduced (the BA diameter was 78.2 +/- 5.3% of that measured on Day 0, p &lt; 0.05 compared with the control SAH group and the AdCMVbeta <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a model of severe vasospasm in dogs, gene transfer of CGRP after injection of blood attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
