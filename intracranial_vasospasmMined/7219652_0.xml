<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primarily it is caused by Noradrenalin (NA) localised in the vessel walls and by platelet aggregation, with raising of the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in the intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its prolongation is based on blood breakdown products and or biochemical disturbances of brain metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most potent vasoconstrictors are acting through the vessel's own receptors (<z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi>, NE, Histamin), so the most effective therapy is based on the contractile system of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By blocking the alpha-receptors by Phenoxybenzamine, blockade of the Phosphodiesterase by Papaverin, Euphyllin to raise the concentration of cAMP and stimulation of Adenyl-Cyclase-System by beta-stimulation, it is possible to get good results in the treatment of cerebral arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
