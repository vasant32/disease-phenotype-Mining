<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a poor resulting outcome of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>; to clarify the mechanism of vasospasm it is important to improve this outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP) is present in the brain as a cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>; it is also an endothelium-derived relaxing factor produced via cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculated that CNP might be an inhibitor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To clarify the role of CNP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, we conducted 1 week monitoring of CNP concentrations in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 26 patients who had undergone clipping within 24 hours of the occurrence of SAH, and divided them into group A (positive for angiographic spasm) and group B (negative for angiographic spasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined CNP concentrations in the CSF of patients who were receiving spinal anesthesia for small orthopedic operations, as reference patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CNP concentration in the CSF on day 1 was higher than in the reference patients and decreased in both test groups, but we did not observe any significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CNP concentrations in the plasma did not change in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CNP concentrations in the CSF were high in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after SAH, whereas plasma CNP concentrations remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, our findings did not support our hypothesis because we did not find any relationship between vasospasm and changes in CNP concentrations in the CSF </plain></SENT>
