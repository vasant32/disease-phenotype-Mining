<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IAP, however, can increase intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined whether IAP alters brain oxygen (BtO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Poor clinical grade (Hunt &amp; Hess IV or V) SAH patients who underwent continuous ICP and BtO2 monitoring during IAP infusion for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were evaluated as part of a prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data are available for five patients (median age 58) who received IAP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> 4 to 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each patient, angiographic vasospasm was improved on postinfusion angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean ICP before IAP was 23.04 +/- 1.18 mmHg; it increased immediately after IAP infusion and remained elevated (29.89 +/- 1.18 mmHg; p &lt; 0.05) during IAP and for approximately 10 minutes after IAP ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 110.55 +/- 1.36 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During IAP treatment MAP remained stable (110.90 +/- 2.00 mmHg; p = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean BtO2 before IAP was 32.99 +/- 1.45 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant BtO2 decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during IAP to a mean of 22.96 +/- 2.9 mmHg (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BtO2 returned to baseline within 10 minutes after IAP ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a modest relationship between the ICP increase and BtO2 decrease (R2 = 0.526) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IAP infusion to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH can increase ICP and reduce BtO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The IAP-induced reduction in BtO2 may help explain why IAP, although it reverses arterial narrowing, does not improve patient outcome </plain></SENT>
