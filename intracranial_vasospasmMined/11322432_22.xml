<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> is an inotropic drug that dilates vessels by phosphodiesterase inhibition in a mechanism similar to that of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of intra-arterial and subsequent intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> on patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> was delivered intra-arterially via catheter at a rate of 0.25 mg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total delivered dose was between 2.5 and 15 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiological measurement of the middle cerebral artery diameter and cerebral blood flow was carried out before and after arterial infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous treatment followed at 0.50 or 0.75 microg/kg/min for up to 2 weeks from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dilation of the vasospastic vessels occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of cerebral blood flow was calculated in six patients and was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent intravenous infusion was effective in preventing a recurrence of symptomatic vasospasm in four of the seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> was effective and safe for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial infusion with adjunctive intravenous infusion holds promise as a clinically advantageous treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
