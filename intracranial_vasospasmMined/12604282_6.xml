<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the important histological changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is endothelial cell damage, which involves <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to determine whether anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> therapy prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reverses vasospasm in a dog SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three mongrel dogs of either sex, weighing 17-25 kg, were subjected to autologous arterial blood injection into the cisterna magna on day 0 and day 2, and sacrificed on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on day 0 before blood injection and on day 7 before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caspase-2 (Z-VDVAD-FMK, 10 microM) inhibitor, caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK, 10 microM) inhibitor, or vehicle (DMSO) were injected intrathecally from day 2 to day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of caspase inhibitors on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and vasospasm were evaluated by angiography and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The residual diameter of the basilar artery on day 7 in SAH dogs without treatment was 53.4+/-5.5% of the day 0 diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marked damage to the endothelial cells, including apoptotic like changes, was observed in these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both caspase inhibitors prevented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only caspase-3 inhibitor, however, had a near-significant effect on reducing 13.3% of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher doses and early treatment, as well as other more potent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitors, are recommended for future studies </plain></SENT>
