<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if the measurement of blood biomarkers of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cerebral metabolism, performed with retrograde jugular catheter, could predict the outcome of poor-grade aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted in 68 poor-grade aSAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,024 blood samples obtained from jugular and radial catheters were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and oxygen content every 8 h for 10 ± 0.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic ratio (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-oxygen index (LOI) were obtained by ratios using arterio-jugular differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was evaluated at 12 months with the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome was unfavorable in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) and the LOI was significantly higher (p = 0.0001) than in the group with favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> cutoff value, below which the patients are likely to have an unfavorable outcome, was determined to be 3.35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, the data obtained in this study demonstrated that the patients achieving an unfavorable outcome were distinguished from those with a favorable outcome by having at least three events of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> inferior to 3.35 (sensitivity = 90 %, specificity = 82.1 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we observed a significant decrease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data provide additional support to the view that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is a reliable marker for predicting the outcome of poor-grade aSAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to confirm its value in multimodal monitoring </plain></SENT>
