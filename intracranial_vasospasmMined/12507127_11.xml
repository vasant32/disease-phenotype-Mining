<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species and subsequent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation are reported to participate in the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This clinical study was performed to investigate the relationships between levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and both delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and clinical outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (PCOOH) and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923">hydroperoxide</z:chebi> (CEOOH) in the CSF were measured in 20 patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' CSF was collected within 48 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and on Day 6 or 7 post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, angiography was performed to verify the degree and extent of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the patients' clinical profiles and the levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> in the CSF were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both PCOOH and CEOOH were detectable in CSF, and their levels decreased within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of CEOOH within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were significantly higher in patients in whom symptomatic vasospasm later developed than in patients in whom symptomatic vasospasm did not develop (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of PCOOH measured within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes than in patients with good outcomes (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> measured in the CSF during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of SAH were predictive of both symptomatic vasospasm and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> in the CSF may be useful prognostically for patient outcomes as well as for predicting symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
