<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular the hydroperoxyeicosatetranenoic acids (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24644">HPETEs</z:chebi>), which are unstable and break down rapidly to the corresponding 5-hydroxy acids (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi>), are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50514">vasoconstrictor agents</z:chebi> that mimic some aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not, however, well established whether segments of cerebral artery can manufacture these products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied the lipoxygenase product profile of cerebral arteries stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rings of bovine cerebral arteries were incubated in Krebs solution containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002524'>lipoxygenase products</z:mp> were studied using high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest peaks had the retention times of 5- and 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi>, and the identity of these peaks was confirmed using specific radioimmunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the formation of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi>, with 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> being most abundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi> was markedly reduced in the presence of AA-861, an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, but not with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data are thus consistent with our previous suggestion that the contractile activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> in cerebral arteries arises, at least in part, from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24644">HPETE</z:chebi> formation and with a possible role for these compounds in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
