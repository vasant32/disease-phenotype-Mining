<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that cerebral arteries from this species are unusually resistant to the action of calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, parallel studies on the in vitro response of cerebral arteries from monkey, dog, and man have been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rings of basilar or middle cerebral artery were tested with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The responses were then reexamined in the presence of various concentrations of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a significant variation among species in sensitivity to nimodipine, the vessels from the monkey being more resistant to nimodipine than those from other species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is, as expected, a considerable difference in the ability of nimodipine to block the different <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> are blocked by low concentrations of nimodipine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species, whereas <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and 5-hydroxytryptamine are more resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species tested, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha were antagonized poorly even by higher concentrations of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If these <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> play a major role in the development of vasospasm and subsequent delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, it may be that the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> exert a beneficial effect by some mechanism other than dilation of spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
