<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared segments of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beagle basilar arteries in vitro with segments of arteries undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm to determine the responsiveness to various <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12,13-diacetate as well as to external <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also compared the effects of W-7 (a calmodulin inhibitor), nicardipine (a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>), and H-7 (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi>) on the spontaneous tonus of arterial segments stabilized at a resting tension of 3 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> segments, the responsiveness to each <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> in segments undergoing vasospasm was essentially unchanged whereas the the responsiveness to external <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In segments undergoing vasospasm the decrease in resting tension induced by W-7 was markedly diminished (p less than 0.01), that induced by nicardipine was unchanged, and that induced by H-7 was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that spontaneous tonus due to activation of the protein kinase C system is significantly augmented in segments undergoing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus this system, rather than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin system, appears to play a major role in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
