<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to measure the levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in CSF from double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> dog models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-two mongrel dogs of either sex, weighing 15-30 kg, underwent double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> by percutaneous needle puncture of the cisterna magna and injection of autologous blood on day 0 and day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dogs were then sacrificed on day 3, 5 and 7, after collecting CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another study, the dogs were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, and caspase-2 and caspase-3 inhibitors from day 3 to day 6 after initial blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF was collected on day 7 before dogs were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in CSF was measured by photometrical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with CSF collected on day 0, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was decreased on days 5-7, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was increased on days 2-7, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> was increased on days 2-7, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was increased on days 3-7 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the groups treated with MAPK or caspase inhibitors, most of the metabolic alterations remained unchanged as compared with CSF from untreated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, caspase inhibitors-2 and -3, and MAPK inhibitor U0126 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failed to prevent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAPK inhibitor PD98059 partially prevented vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated a metabolic alteration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> in CSF during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This metabolic change is consistent with the time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that brain energy metabolites and excitative amino acids are altered during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
