<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on vasospasm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were analyzed retrospectively in 108 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) who were operated on for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> within 48 hours of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two of these patients underwent a procedure for CSF drainage (cisternal drainage, ventricular drainage, lumbar drainage, or a combination of these) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duration, the total volume, and the average daily volume of CSF drainage were 10.4 +/- 7.0 days (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2034 +/- 1566 ml, and 190 +/- 65.3 ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a greater drainage volume at a lower height of drainage in the early period after SAH developed more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> later (P less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the total volume of CSF removed and shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was determined to be statistically significant (P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> after SAH were also found to be statistically associated (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage should not be performed too readily in patients with SAH, because the removal of a large amount of CSF can induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
