<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that inhibition of neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) by administration of L-822429 blunts the decrease in CBF as well as cerebrovascular receptor upregulation in an animal model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced in rats by injection of 250 microl of blood into the prechiasmatic cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NK1R inhibitor L-822429 was injected intracisternally 30 minutes and 24 hours after the induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two days after SAH induction, the basilar arteries were harvested, and contractile responses to endothelin-1 (ET-I, an <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi>- and ETB-receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-carboxamidotryptamine</z:chebi> (a 5-hydroxytryptamine- I1 [5-HT1]-receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) were investigated using sensitive myographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether NKIR inhibition had an influence on local CBF after post-SAH, a quantitative autoradiographic technique was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the vascular receptor phenotype was changed in cerebral arteries through upregulation of contractile ET, and 5-HT1B receptors, while regional and total CBF were markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the selective NK1R inhibitor L-822429 prevented both the receptor upregulation and the reduction in regional and global CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data reveal the coregulation of vascular receptor changes and blood flow effects, and also show that interaction with a small-molecule NK1R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> is a promising area of focus for the development of specific treatments for SAH </plain></SENT>
