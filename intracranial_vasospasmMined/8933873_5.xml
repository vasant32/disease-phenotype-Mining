<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the appropriate concentration of papaverine for therapeutic intraarterial infusion against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated histopathologic changes in cerebral arteries and brain tissue of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Wistar rats that had received infusions of papaverine via the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were infused with 0.20 mL papaverine (concentration, 0.4% to 4.0%) via the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injury to the vascular wall was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy; pathologic changes in cerebral tissue were studied by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was seen under light microscopy at any concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4.0% papaverine concentration, degeneration of endothelial cells and medial smooth muscle, including vacuole formation, was observed under electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1.4% concentration, degeneration of endothelial cells was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extravasation of Evans blue dye was noted when drug concentration exceeded 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 0.8% concentration, no histopathologic change was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of these results, we recommend a papaverine concentration of 0.8% or less for intraarterial infusion </plain></SENT>
