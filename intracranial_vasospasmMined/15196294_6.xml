<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the antimigraine activity of flunarizine and its influence on NO and oxidative marker bioavailability in 25 subjects suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> and in 25 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary samples collected before and after treatment with flunarizine (5 mg orally per day for 6 months) were assayed for NO stable metabolites (NOx) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urinary levels of NOx and TBARS were higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> sufferers before treatment than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in NOx levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> sufferers, before and after flunarizine treatment; urinary TBARS levels were decreased after flunarizine treatment (P &lt; 0.05) and remained persistently higher than in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that flunarizine did not prevent NO-mediated vasodilatation, while it proved effective in limiting the oxidative reactions occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> sufferers </plain></SENT>
