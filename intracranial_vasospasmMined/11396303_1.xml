<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental vasospasm was produced by the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method in the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and tension were recorded simultaneously with a fluorimeter using fura-2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> inhibited [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and contraction in high K+ concentration-stimulated arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> in the control and vasospasm groups </plain></SENT>
