<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 mL blood into the cisterna magna in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rat groups except the control (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 hour and 24 hours after SAH, 5 microg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> was given to group D5, and 10 microg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> was given to group D10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No medication was administered to the haemorrhage group (Group H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and paraoxonase (PON) levels were measured at 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean wall thickness (MWT), mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLD</z:e>), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression of the basilar artery were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and MWT were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lowest <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and MWT were found in Group D10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLD</z:e> was lowest in Group H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCNA expression was observed only in Group D10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> reduces <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and vasospasm following SAH in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
