<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 rats were randomly divided into six groups: control group, day 1, day 3, day 5, day 7, and day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Day 1, day 3, day 5, day 7, and day 14 groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH groups in which the rats were killed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SAH groups, autologous arterial blood was injected into cisterna magna once on day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured by H&amp;E staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining and immunoblotting experiments were performed to detect the expression of NLK protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the presence and quantity of NLK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the artery was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became the most severe on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expressions of NLK protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were decreased remarkably in SAH groups compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The down-regulated expression of NLK was detected after SAH and the low ebb was on day 3, which was oppositely the peak time of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of NLK was present mainly in the neurons in the brain and smooth muscle cells in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NLK is decreasingly expressed in an opposite time-course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) and SAH-induced brain injury in this rat experimental model of SAH and these findings might have important implications during the administration of specific NLK <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> to prevent or reduce CVS or neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
