<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HA 1077 is a novel and potent calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> which is considered to act by employing different mechanisms from the usual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> since it inhibits 1. calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A 23187 induced contraction in arterial strips and 2. phenylephrine induced contraction in calcium free media, suggesting that its site of action is in the intracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HA 1077 is water soluble and relatively stable in light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the efficacy of HA 1077 was evaluated on dogs by using the spiral arterial strips in vitro and by angiography in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the arterial strips from the control dogs, a 50% relaxation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (15 mM) induced contraction was obtained by a 10(-6) M HA 1077 for the "intracranial" basilar and middle cerebral arteries, while a 10(-5) M was needed to obtain the same effect for the "extracranial" common carotid and vertebral arteries, indicating that HA 1077 is more effective for the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
