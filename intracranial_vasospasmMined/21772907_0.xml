<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following traumatic SAH and its relationship with different brain injuries and severity of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2006 to March 2007 in department of Neurosurgery in Al-Zahra Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive head-injured patients who had SAH on the basis of an admission CT scan were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of the trauma was evaluated by determining Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography evaluations were performed at least 48 hours after admission and one week thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA was defined by mean flow velocity (FV) of more than 120 cm/sec with a Lindegaard index (MVA/ICA FV ratio) higher than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vasospasm was defined by FV higher than 85 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy seven patients with tSAH were enrolled from whom 13 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining were 52 (81.2%) men and 12 (18.7%) women, with a mean age of 37.89 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trauma was severe in 11 (17.2%), moderate in 13 (20.3%), and mild in 40 (62.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 27 patients (42.1%) experienced at least one vasospasm during the study period and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vasospasm was the most common in the first and second weeks (55.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic SAH is associated with a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with a higher probability in patients with severe TBI </plain></SENT>
