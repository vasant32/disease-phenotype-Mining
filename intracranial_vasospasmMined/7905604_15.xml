<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve animals received fresh, unheparinized arterial blood via three injections (15 ml total) into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective vertebral arteriography was performed on Day 0, and blood injections were performed on the second and third days after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day selective arteriography was performed to evaluate the diameter of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> group, intrathecal injections of the drug were started on Day 4 and continued for two days (25 micrograms/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery was reduced 72.98 +/- 11.07% in control experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the animals treated with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, the mean diameter of the basilar artery was reduced 29.25 +/- 4.54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> on intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure (BP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was also evaluated in 14 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no prominent changes in ICP, BP, or ECG when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> was given intrathecally, but BP decreased and ICP and heart rate increased with intravenous doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> administered intrathecally is an effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
