<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the significance of these alterations has remained unclear, the present study was undertaken to determine whether there was direct ultrastructural evidence of arterial denervation following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under general anesthesia, adult cats were subjected to pre-pontine injection of blood or serum (5 to 7 ml) via a transclival approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 4, 7, or 10 days later and basilar artery segments were prepared for electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control vessels appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas those bathed in blood revealed unequivocal changes in neural and supporting elements, including: 1) disintegration of both clear- and dense-core vesicles; 2) fragmentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e>; 3) loss of Schwann cell cytoplasm; and 4) <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were most pronounced 7 days after instillation of blood, and correlated in time with maximal injury of the media and endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the development of smooth-muscle hypersensitivity remains unsettled, this study indicates that prolonged exposure to blood can cause extensive denervation of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
