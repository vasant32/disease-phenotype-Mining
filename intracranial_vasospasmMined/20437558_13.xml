<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) contributes to poor outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because there is continuing uncertainty as to whether proximal cerebral artery vasospasm is the only cause of DIND, other processes should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A potential candidate is cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that recurrent CSDs influence cortical oxygen availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Centers in the Cooperative Study of Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) recruited 9 patients with severe SAH, who underwent open neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used simultaneous, colocalized recordings of electrocorticography and tissue oxygen pressure (p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) in human cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We screened for delayed cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by using sequential brain imaging and investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by angiography or time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a total recording time of 850 hours, 120 CSDs were found in 8 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five CSDs ( approximately 46%) were found in only 2 of 9 patients, who later developed DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine ( approximately 75%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CSDs occurred between the 5th and 7th day after SAH, and 96 (80%) arose within temporal clusters of recurrent CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clusters of CSD occurred simultaneously, with mainly biphasic CSD-associated p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> responses comprising a primary hypoxic and a secondary hyperoxic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CSD correlated positively with the duration of the hypoxic phase and negatively with that of the hyperoxic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic phases significantly increased stepwise within CSD clusters; particularly in DIND patients, biphasic p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> responses changed to monophasic p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> decreases within these clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Monophasic hypoxic p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> responses to CSD were found predominantly in DIND patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: We attribute these clinical p(ti)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> findings mainly to changes in local blood flow in the cortical microcirculation but also to augmented metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Besides classical contributors like proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, CSD clusters may reduce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> supply and increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> consumption, and thereby promote DIND </plain></SENT>
