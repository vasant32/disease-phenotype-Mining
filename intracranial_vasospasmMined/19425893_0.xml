<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) can attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, lower endothelin-1 production, and preserve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression by reduction of inducible NO synthase expression in experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the potential antiapoptotic effects of E2 in an experimental rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors examined the antiapoptotic effects of E2 in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH model in male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of a Silastic tube containing corn oil either with or without E2, and some E2-treated animals also received ICI 182,780 (a nonselective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor [ER] <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) for 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm was determined by averaging the cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of apoptotic indicators, including TNF-alpha, caspase 3, Bcl-2, Bax, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL), and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> assays were used for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with E2 significantly attenuated SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the induction of SAH, positive TUNEL-staining was seen, and DNA fragmentation was increased in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased TNF-alpha and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression in the dentate gyrus were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes were reversed with E2-treatment but not in the presence of ICI 182,780 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of Bax did not change after SAH either with or without E2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that E2 appears to confer an antiapoptotic effect that reduces secondary brain injury after SAH via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding provides support for possible future applications of E2 treatment for the reduction of secondary injury after SAH in patients </plain></SENT>
