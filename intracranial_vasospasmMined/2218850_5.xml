<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maximum contractile activities of the vessels in response to noradrenalin and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were significantly less than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the maximum contractile activity of the vessels in response to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha on the seventh day following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was significantly augmented compared with that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant decline in the relaxation of responsiveness to diltiazem during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was observed compared with that of diltiazem in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This responsiveness to vasoactive agents was not influenced by the application of OKY-046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study reveals functional changes in vascular smooth muscle exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in response to vasoactive agents and a calcium entry blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">Thromboxane A2</z:chebi> may not be a significantly influential factor in the present results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may well be related to functional changes of the arterial wall, which appear to be associated with derangement of the mechanisms of smooth muscle constriction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> based on organic changes </plain></SENT>
