<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clipping of the right distal internal carotid artery and the proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in eight dogs decreased regional cortical blood flow (rCoBF) by 58% without changing cardiac output (CO), and caused 10% +/- 5% (SE) hemispheric infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten other dogs underwent similar cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and were infused twice with LMD within 2 hours; each infusion equaled 20% of the respective dog's total blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both CO and rCoBF in the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> increased significantly by 119% +/- 13% and 42% +/- 6%, respectively. following the two LMD infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mean arterial blood pressure was unaltered, the hematocrit decreased significantly and the intracranial pressure (ICP) increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean hemispheric infarction in these 10 treated dogs was 4% +/- 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another nine dogs underwent arterial manipulation without clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hemodiluting LMD infusions, similar to those in the 10 dogs, significantly elevated CO and ICP but not rCoBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that hypervolemic hemodilution with LMD effectively elevates collateral perfusion to ischemic regions of brain distal to occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segments and concomitantly raises the CO and ICP </plain></SENT>
