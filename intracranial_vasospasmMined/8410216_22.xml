<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 13 to 82 years, and three had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent placement of a flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter and the following measurements were obtained during hyperdynamic therapy: pulmonary artery wedge pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index, total peripheral resistance, and left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work index (LVSWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline cardiac function was found to be within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits (LVSWI = 47.6 +/- 4.2 gm/min/sq m and cardiac index = 3.30 +/- 0.22 liter/min/sq m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After baseline measurements were recorded, 5% albumin was infused at 300 cc/hr and dobutamine was initiated at a rate of 5 to 10 micrograms/kg/hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hyperdynamic therapy with dobutamine in the presence of volume loading resulted in a 52% increase in cardiac index, a 15% increase in LVSWI, and a 21% decrease in total peripheral resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical reversal of ischemic symptoms due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was evident in 18 (78%) of the 23 patients </plain></SENT>
