<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue-sticking method was used for primary cultured rat CASMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot were used to examine the PKGI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions after CASMC were transfected by Ad-PKG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of CASMCs was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and 3H-TdR incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ad-PKGI could be transfected into CASMCS and highly express </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> could stimulate the proliferation of CASMC; the value of 3H-TdR incorporation and the absorbance value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> increased and could block up after CASMC was transfected by Ad-PKG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the PKG signaling pathway might play an important role in CVS after SAH, and the PKG gene might be a target point of gene therapy </plain></SENT>
