<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Much is known about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, a devastating sequela to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, yet underlying mechanisms remain unclear and clinical treatments have proven unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesised that biochemical stimuli associated with the formation of extravascular blood clots dominate early maladaptive responses, leading to marked structural and functional changes in affected cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before a precise picture of vasospasm can be obtained, however, we must understand better the structure and mechanical behaviour of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries from rabbits were tested mechanically under biaxial loading conditions with and without active tone, segments were imaged using intravital nonlinear optical microscopy to quantify transmural orientations of fibrillar collagen, and passive mechanical data were fit with a four-fiber family stress-stretch relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This constitutive model predicted well the overall mechanical behaviour and mean collagen fiber distributions, and thereby has promise to contribute to analyses of the biochemomechanics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and similar cerebral pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is now time, therefore, to focus on mechanisms of vasospasm via mathematical models that incorporate growth and remodelling in terms of changes in the cross-linking and distributions of adventitial and medial collagen, primary contributors to the structural integrity of the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
