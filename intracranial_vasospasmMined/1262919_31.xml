<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cumulative log-dose response curves were obtained for most of the agents tested including <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and three different <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>; many of these curves were found to be similar to curves previously obtained with canine cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was concluded from these similarities that canine cerebral arteries are a good in vitro model for studying human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also demonstrated that human cerebrospinal fluid, collected up to 17 days after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e>, would cause large, dose-dependent contractions in human anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
