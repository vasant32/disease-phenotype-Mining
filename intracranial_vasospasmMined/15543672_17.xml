<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (ADMA) inhibits endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and, therefore, may be responsible for decreased NO availability in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether ADMA levels are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two cynomolgus monkeys (six control animals and 16 with SAH) were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of ADMA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi>, and nitrates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were determined on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriography was performed to assess the degree of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses of the right and left middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) were performed to assess the expression of eNOS, type I protein-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> transferase (PRMT1) and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid levels of ADMA remained unchanged in the control group (six animals) and in animals with SAH that did not have vasospasm (five animals; p = 0.17), but the levels increased in animals with vasospasm (11 animals) on Day 7 post-SAH (p &lt; 0.01) and decreased on Days 14 through 21 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid levels of ADMA correlated directly with the degree of vasospasm (correlation coefficient = 0.7, p = 0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate as well as those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16349">L-citrulline</z:chebi> in CSF were decreased in animals with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DDAH2 expression was attenuated in the right spastic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on Day 7 post-SAH, whereas eNOS and PRMT1 expression remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the CSF levels of ADMA are associated with the development and resolution of vasospasm found on arteriograms after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that endogenous inhibition of eNOS by ADMA may be involved in the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of ADMA production may provide a new therapeutic approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
