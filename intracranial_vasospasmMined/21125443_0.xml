<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was induced using the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in seven female beagles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 7, 0.5 ml/kg of 15 mmol/l MgSO(4) in Ringer solution was injected into the cerebellomedullary cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on day 1 (before SAH), and before and 1, 3, and 6 h after the intracisternal injection on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF Mg(2+) was measured at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the diameters of the basilar artery (BA), vertebral artery (VA), and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) before the intracisternal injection on day 7 were 0.59 ± 0.15, 0.41 ± 0.17, and 0.35 ± 0.17 mm, respectively, and were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) compared with the baseline diameters on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BA diameters at 1 h (0.74 ± 0.16 mm) and 3 h (0.73 ± 0.13 mm), the VA diameter at 1 h (0.64 ± 0.14 mm), and the SCA diameter at 3 h (0.54 ± 0.08 mm) after the injection were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF Mg(2+) concentration was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) at 1 h (3.59 ± 0.76 mEq/l) and 3 h (2.00 ± 0.31 mEq/l) after the injection compared with the baseline value (1.35 ± 0.23 mEq/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the reversible effect of intracisternal MgSO(4) solution injection on the spastic artery depends on maintenance of the optimal CSF Mg(2+) concentration </plain></SENT>
