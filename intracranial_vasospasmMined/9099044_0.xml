<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined this issue by testing the effects of hemolysate on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and barrier function of cultured Bovine Middle Cerebral Artery Endothelial Cells (BMCA-ECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate elicited a dose-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cells</z:mp> in confluent cultures of BMCA-ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shape of the surviving cells changed from a typical cobblestone appearance to a spindle-like appearance with increased vacuolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate-induced damage was reduced by co-incubation with bovine calf serum (BCS) in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early impact of hemolysate on endothelial cells was evaluated using a permeability assay in which the passage of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> across a BMCA-EC monolayer was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate significantly increased the permeability of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> across the endothelial barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to its protective effects against cell loss, BCS did not block the early hemolysate-induced increase in transcellular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further implicate erythrocyte contents in the pathogenesis of structural and functional damage to the endothelium following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
