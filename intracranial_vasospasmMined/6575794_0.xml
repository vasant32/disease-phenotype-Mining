<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human basilar arteries were obtained at postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha contracted greatly both human and canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two vessels in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, great differences were found between the two arteries in response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human basilar arteries contracted markedly to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> while canine basilar arteries did not contract to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This data suggests that sympathetics might play a more important role in the genesis of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> than has been previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> did not elicit a contraction in human basilar arteries whereas it produced marked contractions in canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that possible participation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> as a causative agent in vasospasm could be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In view of these differences between human and canine cerebral arteries, the canine seems unsuitable for an experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
