<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples were also obtained from six control patients without evidence of subarachnoid blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smooth-muscle constrictor activity in the CSF was measured by bioassay using the isolated rat stomach fundus preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of unidentified smooth-muscle constrictor substances were considerably greater in CSF from a group of seven patients with evidence of severe angiographic vasospasm and/or delayed ischemic deficits who died (73.8 +/- 39.7 nmol/liter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) equivalents), as compared to 25 other SAH patients who survived (6.5 +/- 1.4 nmol/liter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> equivalents), and six control patients (1.17 +/- 0.34 nmol/liter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> equivalents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that there is a relationship between smooth-muscle constrictor substances in the CSF after SAH and both the degree of angiographic vasospasm and the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that this relationship might be exploited clinically </plain></SENT>
