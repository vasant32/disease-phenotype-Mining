<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The central role of endothelin (ET)-1 in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is indicated by the successful treatment of this vasospasm in several animal models by using selective ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clazosentan is a selective ET(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> that provides for the first time clinical proof that ET-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation was, therefore, to define the pharmacological properties of clazosentan that affect ET(A) receptor-mediated contraction in the cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isometric force measurements were performed in rat basilar artery (BA) ring segments with (E+) and without (E-) endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentration effect curves (CECs) were constructed by cumulative application of ET-1 or big ET-1 in the absence or presence of clazosentan (10(-9), 10(-8), and 10(-7) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory potency of clazosentan was determined by the value of the affinity constant (pA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CECs for contraction induced by ET-1 and big ET-1 were shifted to the right in the presence of clazosentan in a parallel dose-dependent manner, which indicates competitive antagonism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pA2 values for ET-1 were 7.8 (E+) and 8.6 (E-) and the corresponding values for big ET-1 were 8.6 (E+) and 8.3 (E-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present data characterize clazosentan as a potent competitive <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of ET(A) receptor-mediated constriction of the cerebrovasculature by ET-1 and its precursor big ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These functional data may also be used to define an in vitro profile of an ET receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with a high probability of clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
