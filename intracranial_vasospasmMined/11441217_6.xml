<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of protease cascade-based <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and subsequent vascular repair in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we examined the effect of 2 synthetic serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi>-FUT-175, an inhibitor of thrombin and the complement system, and argatroban, a selective inhibitor of thrombin-on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rabbit SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred Japanese White male rabbits were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SAH was simulated by a single injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the caliber of the basilar artery was measured on x-ray film before and at 2 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine groups of rabbits (n=6 each) were treated with continuous intravenous injection of FUT-175 (2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/d), argatroban (1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg/d), or the same amount of saline (vehicle) for 48 hours, starting 40 minutes after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two days after SAH, the expression of homodimer of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in the basilar artery was examined with immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits, 5 microg of recombinant PDGF-BB or vehicle was injected into the cisterna magna, and the basilar arteries were examined on angiograms for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the caliber of the basilar arteries between the vehicle group and the groups with the 3 larger doses of FUT-175 (vehicle, 52+/-5.0%; 5 mg, 79+/-5.7%; 10 mg, 80+/-2.5%; 20 mg, 80+/-3.7%) and between the vehicle group and the groups with the 2 larger doses of argatroban (vehicle, 52+/-6.4%; 2.5 mg, 81+/-9.0%; 5 mg, 85+/-4.1%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the histological examination, administration of effective doses of FUT-175 or argatroban suppressed the expression of PDGF-BB in the endothelial and medial smooth muscle cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exogenous PDGF-BB caused delayed and prolonged vasoconstriction on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the serine protease cascade and/or thrombin after SAH was demonstrated to play an essential role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of PDGF-BB-like protein in the arterial walls correlated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Elevated PDGF-BB level in the subarachnoid space was found to induce delayed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
