<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to provide extensive information about the three most popular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> rat models: the endovascular puncture model, the single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, and the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the basilar artery and posterior communicating artery were chosen for histopathological examination and morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the endovascular puncture model and single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model developed significant degrees of vasospasm, which were less severe when compared with the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endovascular puncture model and double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model both developed more vasospasms in the posterior communicating artery than in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endovascular puncture model has a markedly high mortality rate and high variability in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the present study showed that the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in rats is a more suitable tool with which to investigate mechanism and therapeutic approaches because it accurately correlates with the time courses for vasospasm in humans </plain></SENT>
