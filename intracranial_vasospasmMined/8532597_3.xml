<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of endothelin-1 on relaxation responses induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> substances in canine middle cerebral arteries to better understand regulation of cerebrovascular tone and its potential impact on mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 elicited concentration-dependent contractions in helical strips of canine cerebral arteries (EC50; 4.62 x 10(-9) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with 10(-9) M endothelin-1 significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation elicited by substance P and endothelium-independent relaxations by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although endothelin-1 in a lower concentration (10(-10) M) did not affect these endothelium-independent relaxations, it did inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation caused by substance P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A low concentration (10(-10) M) of endothelin-1 also significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine mesenteric arteries induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin-II</z:chebi> and vasopressin did not inhibit endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that endothelin-1 not only produces cerebral vasoconstriction but also interferes with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> mechanisms and that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 than endothelium-independent vasodiltion </plain></SENT>
