<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin has been recommended especially for the possible prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because prostacyclin is a potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> of the cerebral circulation it is an essential prerequisite for a possible therapeutic use of PG 12 that no negative side effects concerning the intracranial pressure are allowed to occur during intravenous infusion of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study we therefore investigated the course of intracranial pressure during continuous experimental perfusion with prostacyclin in four different dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results and our conclusions concerning further experimental or clinical studies with prostacyclin are presented </plain></SENT>
