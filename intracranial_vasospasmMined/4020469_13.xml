<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The levels of two calcium-binding proteins, S-100 protein and calmodulin, were measured serially in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two proteins have a similar molecular structure and are highly concentrated in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of S-100 protein found in the earliest postoperative CSF samples correlated with the preoperative SAH grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High S-100 protein levels in the CSF were found in patients with poor SAH grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the prognosis of the patients correlated with the S-100 protein levels in the CSF samples taken during the immediate postoperative period and with the daily changes of the S-100 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was followed by a sharp S-100 protein increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that S-100 protein levels in the CSF provide a useful index of organic damage in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, and furthermore that S-100 protein levels and their changes may have prognostic value for patients after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was a lack of correlation between the calmodulin levels and the preoperative grade or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It would be inappropriate, however, to speculate from the results of this study that these calcium-binding proteins in the CSF play any causative role in pathological processes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> after SAH, since changes in the levels of these proteins followed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical signs of deterioration </plain></SENT>
