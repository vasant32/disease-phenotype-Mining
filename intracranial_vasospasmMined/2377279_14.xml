<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the 21-aminosteroid U74006F was investigated using different dosages in a restricted, randomized, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty cynomolgous monkeys were divided into five groups of eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were two groups given treatment with placebos, one being saline and the other the vehicle in which U74006F was delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were three U74006F treatment dosage groups: 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and subarachnoid placement of a clot around the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, angiography was repeated, and the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both saline or vehicle placebo treatment groups, significant vasospasm (VSP) occurred on the clot side in the extradural internal carotid artery (C3), the intradural internal carotid artery, the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A1,) and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After U74006F treatment, significantly less VSP developed in the A1 on the clot side (0.3 mg/kg U74006F treatment group) and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> U74006F treatment groups, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the percentages of change from the baseline for the vessel diameters on the clot side were compared, VSP was attenuated in the A1 (P less than 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P less than 0.001) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> U74006F treatment groups as compared with the placebo treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 0.3 mg/kg of U74006F significantly prevented VSP in C3 (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the 0.3 mg/kg dosage appeared to have the most favorable effect, no significant differences were observed among the three dosage groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on the clot side in the animals treated with U74006F still showed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> convolutions and morphological changes in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These changes appeared less prominent in those <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> with milder VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If these results in primates are applicable to humans, U74006F would be useful in reducing VSP after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
