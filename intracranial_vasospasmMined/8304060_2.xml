<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>; endothelium removal by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">triton</z:chebi> X-100 and endothelin-1 caused narrowing in the diameter of basilar artery of the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathological, ultrastructural investigations and computerized tomography images are in accordance with this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that not only an increase in vasoconstrictor mediator level but also the lack of endothelium-derived relaxing mediators are responsible of the spasm of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
