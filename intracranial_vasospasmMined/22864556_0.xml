<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The calcium channel inhibitor nimodipine has been used for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No evidence-based recommendations for local nimodipine administration at the site of vasospasm exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to quantify nimodipine's local vasodilatory effect in an ex vivo model of SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH-induced vasospasm was modeled by contracting isolated segments of rat superior cerebellar arteries with a combination of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and a synthetic analog of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> A(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A pressure myograph system was used to determine vessel reactivity of spastic as well as non-spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the initial vessel diameter, a combination of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> induced considerable vasospasm (55 ± 2.5 % contraction; n = 12; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Locally applied nimodipine dilated the arteries in a concentration-dependent manner starting at concentrations as low as 1 nM (n = 12; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations higher than 100 nM did not relevantly increase the vasodilatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine's vasodilatory effect was smaller in spastic than in non-spastic vessels (n = 12; p &lt; 0.05), which we assume to be due to structural changes in the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The described ex vivo model allows to investigate the dose-dependent efficacy of spasmolytic drugs prior to in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low concentrations of locally applied nimodipine have a strong vasodilatory effect, which is of relevance when considering the local application of nimodipine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
