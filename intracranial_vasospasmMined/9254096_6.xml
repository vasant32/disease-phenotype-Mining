<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MACs form large-conductance, nonspecific ion channels that can cause lytic or sublytic cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors used a highly sensitive patch clamp technique to assess the contribution of the bystander effect to the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They compared the effect of complement activation by autologous aged versus fresh erythrocytes on the membrane conductance of freshly isolated rat cerebral artery smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of autologous serum aged, but not fresh, erythrocytes caused a large increase in membrane conductance, an effect that was prevented by heat-inactivating the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="30742">Ethyleneglycol</z:chebi> tetraacetic acid in the presence of Mg++ attenuated the effect, indicating that complement activation was taking place via the classic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect was reproduced by zymosan-activated autologous serum, suggesting that such changes in conductance could result from insertion of MACs secondary to a bystander effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both C8- and C9-depleted heterologous sera produced minimal effects that were converted to full effect by addition of the missing complement component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase plus catalase did not attenuate the conductance changes produced by autologous serum plus aged erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autologous serum plus aged erythrocyte membrane ghosts that were free of lysate caused a typical increase in conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that complement activation by aged erythrocytes can result in MAC insertion into innocent bystander smooth-muscle cell membranes and that this mechanism, heretofore undescribed, may contribute to development of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
