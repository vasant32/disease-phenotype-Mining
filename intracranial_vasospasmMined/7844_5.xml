<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cumulative log-dose response curves were obtained for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that the basilar and internal carotid arteries responded much less to these agents than did the mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six blocking agents including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> were tested to determine their effect on the response of the canine basilar artery to log-dose additions of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">prostaglandin F2alpha</z:chebi> and KC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another chamber was developed to study the differential effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> and papaverine when placed on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side versus the adventitial (cerebrospinal fluid) side of the basilar artery during a sustained contraction with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A theoretical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is presented </plain></SENT>
