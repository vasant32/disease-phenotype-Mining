<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After angiographic demonstration of spasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were begun on a continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, 125 mug/hr, and aminophylline, 125 mg/hr, for a period of up to two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infusion was continued until there was clinical or angiographic evidence that spasm had diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients improved on this regimen and three remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> and aminophylline is based on their effect on the enzymes responsible for the formation and degradation of cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> has been noted to produce relaxation of vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that manipulation of these biochemical pathways may provide a method for influencing blood flow through cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
