<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Serial changes of anti-platelet-aggregating activity in the endothelial cells after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were studied in 30 feline two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hour or 2, 4, 7, or 14 days after mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (40 mg/kg) was infused into the basilar artery via the right vertebral artery to activate circulating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> infusion, the basilar artery was fixed by intra-arterial perfusion with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer and was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface was examined under a scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, no platelets adhered or aggregated on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 4 to 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, many platelets were observed adhering or aggregating on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the impairment of anti-platelet-aggregating activity of endothelial cells after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This impairment may be involved in inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by causing platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation </plain></SENT>
