<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of erythrocyte components on smooth muscle has been investigated extensively; however, their action on endothelium remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of different erythrocyte components and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on [CA++]i in cultured bovine pulmonary and cerebral arterial endothelial cells using fura-2 [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i microfluorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate and bloody CSF produced a biphasic [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i response, a peak and a plateau, and the effect of erythrocyte lysate on [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i was attenuated by the endoplasmic reticulum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ pump inhibitors thapsigargin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22450,38615">cyclopiazonic acid</z:chebi>, by the voltage-independent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channel blocker SK&amp;F96365, by the P450 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4754">econazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6923">miconazole</z:chebi> and by the inorganic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ pathway blockers <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that erythrocyte lysate releases <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ from internal stores and promotes <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ influx from voltage from voltage-independent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte lysate was then fractionated into different molecular weight fractions with different pore-size membranes and each fraction was tested separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The component that increased [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i had a molecular weight &lt; 1 kdalton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fractions that contained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> did not affect [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> mimicked the effect of erythrocyte lysate and bloody CSF on [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The P2-purinoceptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> attenuated the effect of ATP, erythrocyte lysate, the fraction &lt; 1 kdalton and bloody CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> are the component of erythrocyte lysate and bloody CSF that increase [Ca+2]i in endothelial cells and that the effect involves P2-purinoceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence is presented that this increase in endothelial [Ca+2]i by erythrocyte lysate causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
