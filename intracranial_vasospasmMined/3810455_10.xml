<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to ascertain whether the contractile responses of isolated canine basilar arteries to xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients was associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration as measured spectrophotometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results clearly showed that spasmogenicity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content were not correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The magnitude and duration of the arterial responses varied greatly, further indicating that more than a single factor was responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potent antagonistic, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect of such proteins as antithrombin III may account for some of the variation, but the results directly complement clinical findings of others indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> is not the singular cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
