<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of high-dosages of the endothelin ET(A/B )receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> in SAH patients at high-vasospasm risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten Fisher group-3 SAH patients, enrolled within 96 h of ictus, received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> in a dose-escalation manner (20, 30, 40 mg/kg/day orally every 4 hours on treatment days 1, 2, and 3 respectively, to a maximum dose of 4000 mg/day), followed by maintenance of the maximum tolerated dose until 14 days post-SAH or vasospasm resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further management followed standard protocols: nimodipine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; daily transcranial Doppler (TCD); "triple-H"/endovascular treatment, as indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the ten patients never developed any clinical or TCD signs of vasospasm; the other eight patients exhibited some elevation of TCD velocities during the vasospasm watch period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the eight patients remained asymptomatic; of them, one had only mild elevation on peak systolic velocities, thought to represent hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other three were further assessed with CT-angiography; this revealed moderate vasospasm (asymptomatic) in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients developed symptomatic vasospasm requiring endovascular treatment; two developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>; both had started <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> relatively later than the other subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse drug effects were flushing and transient liver enzyme elevations, reversible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had ALT/AST elevations &gt;3x <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit, requiring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi>-dose reduction or discontinuation (one case each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> (up to 40 mg/kg/day) appears to be safe in SAH patients at high risk of developing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to properly investigate the efficacy of this regimen in the prevention and treatment of SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
