<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This Phase IIa multicenter study had two parts: a double-blind, randomized Part A (some patients given clazosentan [0.2 mg/kg/hr] and others given placebo), in which statistical inference was performed, and an open-label Part B (patients with established vasospasm given clazosentan [0.4 mg/kg/hr for 12 hours followed by 0.2 mg/kg/hr]) for exploratory purposes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the incidence and severity of angiographic vasospasm on Day 8 after SAH and the safety and tolerability of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (Hunt and Hess Grades III and IV and Fisher Grade &gt; or = 3) were recruited and 32 (15 in the clazosentan group and 17 in the placebo group) were retained in the intent-to-treat population; 19 patients entered Part B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Part A, treatment with clazosentan resulted in a reduced incidence of angiographically evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (40% compared with 88% of patients, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the severity of vasospasm was reduced in the clazosentan group (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Part B of the study, in 50% of assessable patients who were initially treated with placebo reversal of vasospasm was observed following the initiation of clazosentan therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new infarctions was 15% in the clazosentan group and 44% in the placebo group (p = 0.130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no adverse event pattern indicating a specific organ toxicity of clazosentan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that clazosentan reduces the frequency and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following severe aneurysmal SAH with the incidence and severity of adverse events comparable to that of placebo </plain></SENT>
