<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its rarity among the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types, SAH is still responsible for approximately 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fatalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although various preventative and therapeutic interventions have been explored for potential neuroprotection after SAH, a considerable percentage of patients still experience serious neurologic and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> as a result of the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and/or secondary brain damage that occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Z-ligustilide (LIG), the primary lipophilic component of the Chinese traditional medicine radix Angelica sinensis, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury via antiapoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in our study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of LIG after experimental SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats with SAH that was induced using the established double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model were studied with and without LIG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality, neurobehavioral evaluation, brain water content, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability, and vasospasm assessment of the basilar artery were measured on days 3 and 7 after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional testing was done to evaluate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> using TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining as well as immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to identify key proapoptotic/survival proteins, i.e., p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that LIG treatment reduced mortality, neurobehavioral deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the surrounding brain injury site, which accompanied a marked down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, p53, and cleaved caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that LIG may be an effective therapeutic modality for SAH victims by altering apoptotic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
