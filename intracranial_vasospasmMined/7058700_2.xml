<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed at time intervals ranging between 5 and 17 days, and surgery not later than 21 days following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of subarachnoid clots was associated in ten patients, with no or minor vasospasm and no or mild neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thin clots were found in eight patients; one of them had no vasospasm, six had minor vasospasm, and one showed severe vessel narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major clinical signs were absent in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten patients with thick clots developed severe vasospasm, and eight of them severe neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The important aetiological role of local subarachnoid clots developed severe vasospasm, and eight of them severe neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The important aetiological role of local subarachnoid clots in determining vasospasm in emphasized in view of surgical timing </plain></SENT>
