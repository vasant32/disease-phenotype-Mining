<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture develop some degree of vasospasm, whereas relatively few suffer from ultimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prophylactic use of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> Nimodipine is linked to a beneficial anti-ischemic effect in SAH, although narrowing of large bore arteries still seems to develop despite administration of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of vascular spasm, mainly in the arterioles has been implicated as the major mechanism of action, although a neuronprotective effect of Nimodipine has been suggested as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present paper presents fragmentary evidence that Nimodipine does elicit a vasoactive response in the cerebral vasculature early during the development of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and that this response seems closely linked to reversal of attendant ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
