<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a primary complication after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that the activation of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K+) channels may be of benefit in relieving spastic constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effects of systemic administration of a K+ channel activator, cromakalim, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental SAH was performed in rabbits by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injections of cromakalim or vehicle were administered twice daily with the first injection administered 1 hour after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed by perfusion-fixation 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross-sectional areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Experimental SAH induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in untreated and vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cromakalim attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect achieved statistical significance at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support the concept that targeting vascular K+ channels can be of benefit in preventing the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings also indicate that cromakalim represents a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebrovascular pathophysiology after SAH </plain></SENT>
