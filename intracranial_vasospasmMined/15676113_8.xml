<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> remains a formidable challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prompt recognition of this complication is essential to prevent ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial orders should include adequate fluid and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> supplementation to avoid volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> is not effective in reducing the incidence of vasospasm and may be deleterious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral nimodipine (60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days) should be started on admission because it protects against delayed ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing blood flow velocities on serial transcranial Doppler studies are reliable indicators of early development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When symptomatic vasospasm occurs, hemodynamic augmentation therapy should be instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crystalloids and colloids may be used to promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colloids may provide additional benefit by producing hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the rheological benefits of hemodilution may be offset by reduced oxygen carrying capacity when hematocrit drops below 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> may be induced by administering inotropic drugs and, in certain cases, cardiac output optimization using dobutamine also is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When aggressive medical therapy fails to reverse ischemic deficits, prompt endovascular intervention is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Focal vasospasm of larger vessels may be effectively treated with angioplasty and the benefits of this procedure are durable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diffuse vasospasm involving smaller arterial branches may be treated with intra-arterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, such as papaverine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, or nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these dilatory effects tend to be short-lasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In refractory cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may be considered, although value of this strategy remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
