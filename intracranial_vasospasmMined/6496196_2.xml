<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a new treatment regimen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48675">antifibrinolytic drugs</z:chebi> in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhages</z:hpo>, we have systematically controlled the level of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of severe vasospasm with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> has been compared with the patient's initial level of FDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients have been included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in Hunt and Hess's grades I or II on their arrival.) Patients with a secondary deterioration unrelated to vasospasm were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FDP levels were measured in the first three days following the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and we were informed of them at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of severe vasospasm was confirmed by arteriography and computed tomography (CT) and it was named "severe" when accompanied with signs of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients developed a severe vasospasm with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the mean value of the initial FDP level was between 80 and 320 mcg/ml compared with 20 to 80 mcg/ml for those who had not developed clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two different groups may be discriminated by their initial FDP level: FDP greater than 80 mcg/ml; n = 23, 65% severe vasospasm; FDP less than 80 mcg/ml; n = 27.8% no severe vasospasm (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results do not imply a direct role of FDP in pathophysiological mechanisms of vasospasm, but they suggest a relationship between the clot lysis and the appearance of vasospasm with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first time that such a predictive role can be attributed to the initial FDP level in the prognosis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
