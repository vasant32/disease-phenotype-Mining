<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five rabbits receiving intracisternal injection of 3 mL autologous nonheparinized blood or 3 mL saline were divided into four groups as follows: (1) saline injected and no treatment (control group, n = 6); (2) blood injected and no treatment (SAH group, n = 20); (3) blood injected and treated by multiple intracisternal injections of 30,000 U of h-r SOD in 0.5 mL saline (SOD group, n = 9); and (4) blood injected and treated by multiple intracisternal injections of 0.5 mL saline (saline group, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial angiograms were performed after the blood injection, and the diameter of the basilar artery was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three animals from the control group and five animals from the SAH and SOD groups each were killed 2 days after SAH, and their basilar arteries were processed for transmission electron microscopic observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the SAH and saline groups, the diameter of the basilar arteries was significantly reduced (28 +/- 14% and 27 +/- 9%, respectively) at 2 days after the blood injection, then recovered to pre-SAH levels until 11 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the SOD group, the diameter of the basilar artery was only minimally changed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy revealed endothelial injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> basilar arteries in the SAH group, whereas endothelial injury was minimal in the SOD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We determined that h-r SOD prevents the occurrence of vasospasm, possibly as a result of preventing endothelial injury initiated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
