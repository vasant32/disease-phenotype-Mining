<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rabbits with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of IVIG on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the endothelial cells of the basilar artery was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were allocated randomly into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1, the control group, was subjected to sham surgery (no induction of SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 had SAH alone and Group 3 had SAH plus IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three days after treatment, the animals were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery tissues were analysed histologically and the malondialdehyde levels in the brain stem tissues were evaluated biochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differences in the histopathological <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas and full wall thicknesses in the SAH plus IVIG group and the SAH group were statically insignificant (p &gt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The malondialdehyde level was also found to be lower in the IVIG group than in the SAH group, although this difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the IVIG treatment was revealed to have no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect on the SAH-induced spastic basilar artery, it was shown to have a beneficial effect on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of endothelial cells, probably via anti-inflammatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
