<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Efficiency of the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) by interfering with the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophospate (cGMP) pathway seems to be inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, it remains unclear whether or not insufficient access to the drugs or impaired reactivity of the vessels is responsible for this inconsistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to characterize this pathway on cerebral arteries during CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CVS was induced using the rat double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model and was determined by magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed on Day 3 and Day 5 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of the basilar artery for endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthases and the alpha- and beta-subunits of the soluble guanylate cyclase was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery ring segments on Day 5 were used for measurement of isometric force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentration effect curves for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, and 8-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-cGMP were constructed and compared by maximum effect and pD2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunohistochemical expression of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase was comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The soluble guanylate cyclase alpha- and beta-subunits were significantly diminished on Day 3, but recovered by Day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relaxation attributable to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and 8-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-cGMP was virtually identical in controls and during CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Relaxation attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, however, was significantly enhanced after SAH (maximum effect, control: 88 +/- 12%; Day 5: 117 +/- 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present investigations suggest the persistence of endothelium-, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-, and cGMP-dependent relaxation during CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the treatment of CVS interfering with this pathway seems not to be limited by alterations inside the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
