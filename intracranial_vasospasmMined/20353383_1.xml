<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), accounts for 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> each year and claims one of the highest mortalities and morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many therapeutic interventions have been used to treat brain injury following SAH but none have reached the level of effectiveness needed to clinically reduce mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), a major component of the Chinese traditional medicine Panax Ginseng, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury and myocardial injury via anti-apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the use of GRb1 on SAH induced brain injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four groups were used: sham, vehicle (SAH), low dose treatment (SAH+ 5mg/kg GRb1), and high dose treatment (SAH+ 20mg/kg GRb1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post assessment included wall thickness and mean cross-section area of basilar artery were measured for evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, Evans blue extravasations to assess blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability, immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis looking for specific pro-apoptotic markers, and tunnel staining for cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, mortality, neurological function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that high dose GRb1 treatment significantly enlarged mean cross-sectional area and decreased wall thickness of basilar artery, reduced neurological deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption, and TUNEL positive cell expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Same time, we found that the proteins expression of P53, Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of bcl-2 was up-regulated in Rb1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that GRb1 could relieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and potentially provide neuroprotection in SAH victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms may be partly related to inhibition of P53 and Bax dependent proapoptosis pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More studies will be needed to confirm these results and determine its potential as a long term agent </plain></SENT>
