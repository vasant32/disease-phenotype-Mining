<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unilateral surgical section of the trigeminal nerve at post- but not at pre-Gasserian level caused constriction of the major ipsilateral cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pre- or postganglionic trigeminal lesion induced an increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake globally without influencing the cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the decrease in cerebral blood flow was similar of that seen in control animals, while post-ganglionically lesioned animals had an additional increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal injection of gamma-globulin against substance P prevented the occurrence of vasospasm and the decrease in cerebral blood flow, while calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) anti-gamma-globulin injection significantly reduced the resting vessel diameter and did not influence spasm development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> reflex mechanism could underlie <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular sensory nerves have both a peripheral and a central function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A peripheral or axon reflex mechanism exerts a tonic effect on the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Central neurotransmission seems to be involved in the regulation of cerebral metabolism and possibly in the coordination of cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CGRP could be the transmitter involved in a peripheral axon reflex and substance P might be the neurotransmitter conveying information to the brainstem vascular centers </plain></SENT>
