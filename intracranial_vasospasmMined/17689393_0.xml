<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was induced in 13 adult beagle dogs using the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven beagle dogs served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography of the basilar artery and measurements of rCBF with colored microspheres were performed on days 1 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diameter of the basilar artery was calculated at equidistant points from the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In controls, basilar artery diameter (mm) and rCBF (mL/min/g) were equal on days 1 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, basilar artery diameter decreased significantly (1.27 +/- 0.17 [mean +/- SD]-0.84 +/- 0.15 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rCBF decreased significantly (P &lt; .05) in the cerebrum (1.69 +/- 0.54 [mean +/- SD]-1.06 +/- 0.45 mL/min/g), cerebellum (1.18 +/- 0.40-0.80 +/- 0.32 mL/min/g), and brain stem (0.81 +/- 0.33-0.51 +/- 0.21 mL/min/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, decrements in CBF were not correlated to the reduction in vessel caliber in the corresponding vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Induced SAH in the canine model produces a significant impairment in rCBF irrespective of the degree of vasospasm of large cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings support the presumptive role of the microvasculature in regard to delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after SAH </plain></SENT>
