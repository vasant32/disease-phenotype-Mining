<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery caliber was angiographically measured after either vertebral artery perfusion or cisternal injection of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cats and dogs, ET-1 (5-500 pmol) induced a dose-dependent basilar artery contraction in vivo when applied intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction was extremely long lasting; no significant recovery of vessel caliber was observed up to 12 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bolus injection of ET-1 up to 3 nmol into the vertebral artery had no appreciable effect on the basilar artery caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that ET-1 acts in cerebral vessels from the adventitial but not from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side, possibly due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The long-lasting nature of the ET-1-induced constriction of the cerebral arteries in vivo suggests that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
