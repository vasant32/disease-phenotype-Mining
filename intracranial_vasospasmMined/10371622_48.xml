<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the first part of this study, patients were retrospectively reviewed to correlate middle cerebral artery absolute blood flow velocities with angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second part of the study, the middle cerebral artery/ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery velocity ratio (Lindegaard ratio) was prospectively correlated with angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasm was independently graded, by observers blinded to the TCD results, as either none, mild (less than one-third artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing), moderate (one-third to one-half narrowing), or severe (more than one-half narrowing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios for positive and negative TCD results, positive and negative predictive values, and kappa and P values were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred one patients were analyzed in the first part of the study, and 44 patients were analyzed in the second part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement regarding angiographic vasospasm was good (kappa = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite significant correlation between mean velocities and the degree of vasospasm, the clinical dependability of TCD velocities (evaluated using predictive values and likelihood ratios) was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of velocities of &gt; or =200 cm/s for moderate/severe angiographic vasospasm was 87% but that of lower velocities was approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive value of velocities of &lt;120 cm/s was 94% but that of higher velocities was approximately 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only the likelihood ratios for velocities of &lt;120 or &gt; or =200 cm/s were useful (likelihood ratio for negative result = 0.17, likelihood ratio for positive result = 16.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 57% of patients exhibited maximum velocities in the indeterminate range between 120 and 199 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lindegaard ratios did not improve the predictive value of TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For individual patients, only low or very high middle cerebral artery flow velocities (i.e., &lt;120 or &gt; or =200 cm/s) reliably predicted the absence or presence of clinically significant angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intermediate velocities, which were observed for approximately one-half of the patients, were not dependable and should be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
