<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Papaverine is used to vasodilate cerebral arteries undergoing vasospasm from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, papaverine inhibits cellular respiration in vitro and could cause neurotoxicity in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 5 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> who were treated with intra-arterial papaverine preserved with chlorobutanol and imaged with MRI fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had histological analysis of the brain at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients exhibited marked neurological decline immediately after treatment, and this was sustained through hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, MRI images showed selective gray matter-only signal changes within the vascular territory treated with papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis of 1 case brought to autopsy showed selective injury to islands of neurons with relative sparing of white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial delivery of papaverine preserved with chlorobutanol into vasospastic anterior cerebral arteries may result in marked neurological deterioration with selective gray matter changes on MRI imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect is consistent with a permanent toxic effect to human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this toxicity is caused by papaverine or chlorobutanol, and its use in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> should be reserved for cases without alternatives </plain></SENT>
