<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with life-threatening neurological deficits from vasospasm refractory to other measures, high dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was used in an attempt to prevent permanent changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case angiography was performed and intracranial pressure was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi>, a low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If intracranial pressure (ICP) was elevated, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial pressure was maintained at not less than 140/90 preoperatively and 180/100 postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">Barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was continued until vasospasm decreased angiographically and ICP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 patients perished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One had a fatal rebleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One died of an iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four died from uncontrollable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One improved slightly and then died from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One died of increased ICP when her ventriculostomy malfunctioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One improved and was responding purposefully to pain, only to die suddenly with a low ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients became awake and responsive to verbal commands; 1 of these died from Klebsiella <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and the other died from an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the 3 patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was also used, profound alterations in acid-base and fluid electrolyte balance occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These discouraging results are most likely a reflection of the severity of the patients' condition at the beginning of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There may be some benefit of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> in the management of vasospasm, and the potential effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> may be more obvious if therapy is started at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, until further evidence of the usefulness of this modality becomes manifest, it should be limited to patients with life-threatening impairments unresponsive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other measures </plain></SENT>
