<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: despite the years of study on it, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is still an important cause of mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presented study was undertaken to show whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> tadalafil can attenuate the vasospasm process following subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: in this study, 20 male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2,500-3,000 g were randomly assigned to four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals in group 1 were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 2, animals were given oral tadalafil at 12, 24 and 36 h and SAH was not induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SAH induced animals in group 3 did not receive any medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 4, animals received tadalafil at 12, 24 and 36 h after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed via exsanguination at 48 h after induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brains and brainstems with overlying basilar arteries were removed and stored in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> at +4Â°C overnight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were sectioned from four separate zones, and four sections were obtained from each rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas were measured by using SPOT for Windows version 4.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were performed using Kruskal Wallis and ANOVA tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: the SAH induced group which had been treated with tadalafil had significantly greater basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area than the untreated group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between control group and non-SAH induced group in terms of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: tadalafil has a potentially preventive effect in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
