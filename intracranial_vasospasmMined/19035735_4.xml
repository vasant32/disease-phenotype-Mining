<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) increases global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> according to a number of experimental models as well as some anecdotal reports in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, such stimulation has not been systematically applied for use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the authors examined the effect of cervical SCS on cerebral vasoconstriction in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced with 2 blood injections through an indwelling catheter in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord stimulation was applied 90 minutes after induction of the second SAH (Day 0) or on Day 5 post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the basilar artery (BA) diameter and cross-sectional area and regional CBF (using laser Doppler flowmetry and (14)C-radiolabeled N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>) were obtained and compared between SAH and sham-operated control rats that did not receive SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At Day 0 after SAH, there were slight nonsignificant decreases in BA diameter and cross-sectional area (89 +/- 3% and 81 +/- 4%, respectively, of that in controls) in no-SCS rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this time point, BA diameter and crosssectional area were slightly increased (116 +/- 6% and 132 +/- 9%, respectively, compared with controls, p &lt; 0.001) in SCS-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On Day 5 after SAH, no-SCS rats had marked decreases in BA diameter and cross-sectional area (64 +/- 3% and 39 +/- 4%, respectively, compared with controls, p &lt; 0.001) and corrugation of the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were reversed in rats that had received SCS (diameter, 110 +/- 9% of controls; area, 106 +/- 4% of controls; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> reduced CBF at Days 0 and 5 post-SAH, and SCS increased flows at both time points, particularly in regions supplied by the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study showed that SCS can reverse BA constriction and improve global CBF in this SAH model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord stimulation may represent a useful adjunct in the treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
