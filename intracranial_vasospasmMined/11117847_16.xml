<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the ability of the MAPK inhibitors <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 and U-0126 to reverse vasospasm in a double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two adult mongrel dogs of either sex, each weighing 18 to 24 kg, were divided randomly into four groups: control SAH (four dogs), vehicle- (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, six dogs), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059- (six dogs), and U-0126-treated groups (six dogs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was created by an autologous blood injection into the cisterna magna on Days 0 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An intracisternal injection of MAPK inhibitors was administered once per day on Days 3 through 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed on Days 0 and 7 before the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to study the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and drug treatment on the MAPK immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe vasospasm developed in the dogs in the control and vehicle-treated groups (basilar artery [BA] diameter reduction 46.6 +/- 5.5% and 49.3 +/- 4.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059-treated group, most of the dogs developed mild vasospasm (18.9 +/- 6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the U-0126-treated group, severe vasospasm was observed despite treatment (39.6 +/- 6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 but not the U-0126 abolished MAPK immunoprecipitation in the spastic BAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 or U-0126 improved the clinical scores of the dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first in which the effects of MAPK inhibitors on vasospasm have been investigated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrate that MAPK may play a role in vasospasm and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059 is a potential candidate for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
