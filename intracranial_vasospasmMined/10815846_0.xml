<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved management has increased survival but little has been discussed about rehabilitation, including medication management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, experience and therapeutic drug management are described during inpatient rehabilitation with three patients with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 14 is a 50-year-old male with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> for poor initiation with a good response, improving by 50 FIM points in 44 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2 is a 44 year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and deficits in attention and initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">Methylphenidate</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficits</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> for poor initiation was associated with an excellent functional gain (50 FIM points in 37 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She eventually returned to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Case 3 is a 46-year-old female with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Without neuropharmacologic intervention, she gained 35 FIM points during an uneventful 47 day rehabilitation stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acutely, cocaine can induce cerebral vasoconstriction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> and intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> use depletes and destroys dopaminergic pathways, which may be a major factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and attention and initiation deficits-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observed in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Generally, rapid improvements were seen in mood and cognition in two cases where medication was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on the current literature and pathophysiology of CAS, it is suggested that trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48560">dopaminergic agents</z:chebi> for cognition and extremely cautious use of buproprion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may be warrented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Details of the above cases and the practical and theoretical issues of neuropharmacologic intervention in CAS are discussed </plain></SENT>
