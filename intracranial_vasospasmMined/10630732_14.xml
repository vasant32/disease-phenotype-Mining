<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) model, the sensitivity of spastic basilar arteries to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) was enhanced whereas the endothelial function to release/produce NO became impaired, as described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assumed from these results that low-dose NO might selectively dilate spastic arteries without influencing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or systemic blood vessels; therefore, we investigated whether exogenous low-dose NO effectively improves <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low-dose NO was derived from a small size of the tape containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>, which is not invasive and is clinically available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna of the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed on the following three groups: (a) SAH group with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> tape (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> group), (b) SAH group with placebo tape (placebo group), and (c) saline group injected with saline instead of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tape containing 0.675 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> was applied once daily for 2 days onto the skin area of the rabbit's ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were performed once before cisternal injection of blood and/or saline and again on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 2 the basilar artery was isolated and sliced into 2-mm ring preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relaxations of the basilar artery to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, as well as the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and endothelin- 1, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery on day 2 was reduced to 69.6+/-2.2% (n = 7) before the injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The angiographic vasospasm of the basilar artery was partially but significantly (p&lt;0.0001) improved to the percentage diameter of 89.4+/-1.4% (n = 7) by the application of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>, which did not affect the systemic blood pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the basilar artery preparations harvested from SAH rabbits on day 2, the impaired <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was partially but significantly (p&lt;0.001) improved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this group remained unaffected in the increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> and the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> tape effectively improved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH without any significant changes in the systemic circulation and would be one of the useful and noninvasive treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results seem to be partially affected by the effective dilation of the spastic artery and the improvement of the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation with low-dose NO </plain></SENT>
