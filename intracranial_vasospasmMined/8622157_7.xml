<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, an important role of platelet-activating factor (PAF), an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mediator, has been demonstrated in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors examined whether intravenous administration of the novel PAF <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, E5880, can prevent vasospasm following SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A vasospasm model was produced in three groups of rabbits using two subarachnoid injections of autologous arterial blood, followed by intravenous administration of distilled water (control), a low dose of E5880 (0.1 mg/kg in distilled water), or a high dose of E5880 (0.5 mg/kg in distilled water) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deterioration was largely prevented in the rabbits that received E5880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery constriction was also reduced by both doses of E5880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination at autopsy predominantly showed ischemic changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals in each E5880-treated group exhibited ischemic changes less frequently than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> concentrations were reduced in rabbits treated with E5880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet-activating factor was immunolocalized in the intima and media of the basilar artery in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PAF immunoreactivity demonstrated in the basilar artery was decreased in the E5880 groups in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study provides evidence that PAF may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH and that intravenous administration of E5880 is a promising approach in preventing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
