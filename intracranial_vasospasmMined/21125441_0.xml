<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: osteopontin (OPN), a pleiotropic extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, has been reported to have neuroprotective effects against early brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine if osteopontin prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: the endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> model of SAH was produced, and 62 rats were randomly assigned to sham + vehicle, SAH + vehicle, and SAH+ r-OPN (0.1 microg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by India ink angiography at 24 and 72 h after SAH, as well as neurobehavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: significant vasospasm and neurological impairments occurred over the observed period after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>r-OPN significantly prevented vasospasm in the left middle cerebral artery at 24 h and improved neurological impairments at 48 h after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In other time points studied, r-OPN had a tendency toward improving both vasospasm and neurological scores, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: this study shows that r-OPN has anti-vasospastic effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
