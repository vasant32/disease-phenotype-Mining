<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of membrane potential of arterial smooth muscle through activation or inhibition of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K+) channel activity provides an important mechanism to dilate or constrict arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effect of a K+ channel activator, cromakalim, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By the route of topical application and intra-arterial injection, basilar arteries were exposed transclivally and measured on-line using videomicroscopic camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous microinjection from right vertebral artery was given after the result of application was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery spasm induced by SAH was released by topical or intra-arterial administration of cromakalim, and this beneficial effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between topical and intra-arterial administration of cromakalim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that K+ channel activator may play an important role for ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An important goal of future studies will be to carefully evaluate the possibility and effect of intra-arterial administration of cromakalim to treat angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
