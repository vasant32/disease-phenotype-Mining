<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most likely spasmogenic component of HbO2 is iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, have prevented vasospasm in vivo with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> of iron in the ferric state have been studied in animal models of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because free radical formation requires the ferrous (Fe++) moiety and Fe++ is a potent binder of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, the authors hypothesized that iron in the ferrous state causes vasospasm and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> of Fe++, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi>, may prevent vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi> on vasospasm after induction of SAH in a primate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve cynomolgus monkeys were randomly divided into two groups and then both groups underwent placement of an arterial autologous blood clot in the subarachnoid space around the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The five animals in the control group received intravenously administered saline and the seven treated animals received intravenously administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi>) for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential arteriography for assessment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameter was performed before and on the 7th day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by means of treatment with continuous intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi> is reported in a primate model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result provides insight into the possible mechanism of delayed vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH and provides a potential preventive therapy for it </plain></SENT>
