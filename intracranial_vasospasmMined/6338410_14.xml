<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi> are mediators of the pathological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and that a reduced synthesis of prostacyclin in the vessel wall might also contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with this malady </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed, therefore, to ascertain whether known inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi> synthesis would negate the changes that accompany the intracisternal administration of 4 ml of autogenous arterial blood to dogs and whether prostacyclin would lyse the vasospasm that is present 24 hours after this intrathecal blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) were given intravenously to anesthetized dogs 30 minutes before and again 3 hours after the intracisternal injection of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was studied arteriographically for 1 hour after the intrathecal blood and again on the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral recovery of the animals was also evaluated on the day after the simulated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that, as a group, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced the occurrence of vasospasm and behavioral change associated with intrathecal blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> was more efficacious than meclofenamate, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>, or aspirin in preventing both the vascular and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This efficacy may be due to the long half-life of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> and to known and unknown pharmacological differences among these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, prostacyclin infused via the vertebral artery failed to affect the vasospasm present 24 hours after intrathecal blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that a suitable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> could provide clinical protection from the deleterious consequences of SAH </plain></SENT>
