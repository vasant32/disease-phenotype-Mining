<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of the loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A bioassay system was developed to measure the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from canine basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced in dogs by two injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were performed on the 7th day after SAH to check the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed on the 8th day, and in vitro experiments were performed on rings harvested from the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These confirmed loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to bradykinin and arginine vasopressin in the group with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perfusate was bioassayed with a ring of coronary artery without endothelium (bioassay ring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release of the EDRF was detected by relaxation of the bioassay ring contracted with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arginine vasopressin and bradykinin added to the perfusate upstream of the basilar artery caused concentration-dependent release of the EDRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The direct effect of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on the smooth muscle of the bioassay ring was to cause contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The release of the EDRF was identical in basilar arteries from the control and the SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the release of the EDRF is not impaired during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm, and thus that the loss of the endothelium-dependent relaxation is due to a decreased transfer of the EDRF or a reduced responsiveness of the smooth muscle to the factor </plain></SENT>
