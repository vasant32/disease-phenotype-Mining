<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contraction of the isolated rabbit basilar artery by an exposure to 1.0 ml of whole rabbit blood plus 0.05 or 0.1 units/ml of thrombin was diminished by the treatment with 10(-4) M of OKY-046 and/or 10(-6) M of cinanserin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the whole blood of rabbits treated intravenously with 1 mg/kg/min of OKY-046 was used, the contraction of the basilar artery was decreased to about half of the control contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographically recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in vivo, by a transorbital injection of 5.0 to 7.0 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of dogs, was suppressed by 0.05 and 0.5 microgram of OKY-046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the decrease in the regional cerebral blood flow in autologous blood infused-dogs was inhibited by 0.5 microgram of OKY-046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in the cerebrospinal fluid of dogs was significantly inhibited, and the level of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> was slightly increased by the treatment of OKY-046 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> was increased from 1.5 to 5.2 in OKY-046-treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect on the basal tone and response to vasoactive <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">PGE1</z:chebi> was observed in the isolated spiral thoracic aorta of guinea pigs or rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together with our previous findings, we conclude that the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the in vitro and in vivo models by the treatment of OKY-046 might be due to an inhibition of platelet aggregation, an inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> generation and an increase in the ratio of PGl2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
