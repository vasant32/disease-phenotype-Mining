<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Objectives: To examine the possibility of acupuncture as a new promising treatment to prevent delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, retrospective comparison was done of patient outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) treated with and without acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods: Twenty (20) patients with SAH were treated after their ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had been secured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture treatments were applied to the bilateral Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) once a day for 2 weeks, starting within 3 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of angiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND), the patient's functional status at discharge, and mortality rate were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient outcomes were compared with those of an age- and severity-matched comparison group composed of patients treated in the hospital without acupuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: None of the patients who received acupuncture died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic vasospasms occurred in 5 patients (25.0%) and DIND in 2 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of functional impairment, the modified Rankin score at discharge was â‰¤2 in 7 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, angiographic vasospasms occurred in 10 patients (55.6%) and DIND in 7 (38.9%), similar to the reported incidence in conventionally treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Patients with SAH who received acupuncture had a significantly lower incidence of DIND and significantly improved function at discharge, suggesting that acupuncture is effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In light of these promising results, a randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine the efficacy of acupuncture in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
