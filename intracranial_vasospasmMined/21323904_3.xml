<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is the persistent constriction of large conduit arteries in the base of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pathologically sustained contraction of the arterial myocytes has been attributed to locally elevated concentrations of vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (spasmogens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the presence and function of KCNQ (K(v) 7) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels in rat basilar artery myocytes, and determined the efficacy of K(v) 7 channel activators in relieving spasmogen-induced basilar artery constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Expression and function of K(v) 7 channels in freshly isolated basilar artery myocytes were evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and whole-cell electrophysiological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional responses to K(v) 7 channel modulators were studied in intact artery segments using pressure myography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five mammalian KCNQ subtypes (KCNQ1-5) were detected in the myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K(v) currents were attributed to K(v) 7 channel activity based on their voltage dependence of activation (V(0.5) âˆ¼-34 mV), lack of inactivation, enhancement by flupirtine (a selective K(v) 7 channel activator) and inhibition by 10,10-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)anthracen-9-one (XE991; a selective K(v) 7 channel blocker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>XE991 depolarized the myocytes and constricted intact basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi>, a clinically used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi>, not only enhanced K(v) 7 currents but also inhibited voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In arteries pre-constricted with spasmogens, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and flupirtine were more effective in dilating artery segments than was nimodipine, a selective L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: K(v) 7 channels are important determinants of basilar artery contractile status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Targeting the K(v) 7 channels using flupirtine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> could provide a novel strategy to relieve basilar artery constriction in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
