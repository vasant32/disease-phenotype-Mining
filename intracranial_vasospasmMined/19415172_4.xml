<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether local levels of ET-1 and NO in cerebral arterial plasma and/or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with the occurrence of CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CVS was induced using the one-haemorrhage rabbit model and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography of the rabbits' basilar artery on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to sacrifice, local CSF and basilar arterial plasma samples were obtained by a transclival approach to the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic arterial plasma samples were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET-1 levels were determined by immunometric technique (pg/ml +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and total nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> level spectrophotometrically (micromol/l +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Angiographic CVS was documented after SAH induction (n = 12, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ET-1 level in CSF was significantly elevated by 27.3% to 0.84 +/- 0.08 pg/ml in SAH animals (n = 7) in comparison to controls (0.66 +/- 0.04 pg/ml, n = 7, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in ET-1 levels in systemic and basilar arterial plasma samples of SAH animals compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant lack of local NO metabolites was documented in basilar arterial plasma after SAH (36.8 +/- 3.1 micromol/l, n = 6) compared to controls (61.8 +/- 6.2 micromol/l, n = 6, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an elevated ET-1 level in CSF and local lack of NO in the basilar arterial plasma samples are associated with CVS after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
