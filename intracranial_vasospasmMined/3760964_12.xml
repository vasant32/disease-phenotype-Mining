<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have studied the changes induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the density and distribution of cerebral perivascular nerves in monkeys and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SAH was induced in monkeys by placement of an autologous blood clot after opening the basal cisterns over the arteries of the circle of Willis on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the rat study, SAH was induced by injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nerves examined were adrenergic nerves, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves, vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (VIP)-like immunoreactive nerves, and substance P-like immunoreactive nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the monkey study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals underwent baseline cerebral angiography, then had repeat angiography just before sacrifice on Day 2, 7, 28, or 70 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two sham-operated monkeys underwent the surgical procedure without clot placement and were sacrificed on postoperative Day 7, after repeat angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clot placement in monkeys reduced staining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) perivascular nerves for between 2 and 28 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of stained nerve fibers of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>'s on the non-operated side was slightly reduced on Days 2 and 7 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated monkeys showed a mild reduction of staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nerves, but only on the operated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was observed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> angiograms taken on Days 2 and 7 following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No vasospasm was found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or sham-operated monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The disappearance of nerve staining without associated vasospasm was found on the operated side of the sham-operated monkeys and on the clot side of the animal sacrificed on Day 28 after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rats sacrificed on Days 2 and 7 post-SAH showed reduction in adrenergic and VIP-like immunoreactive staining around basilar arteries, while nerves containing AChE were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Saline-injected rats exhibited no change in the appearance of perivascular innervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SAH as well as surgical manipulation of the vessel wall caused a reduction of the studied substances in cerebral perivascular nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This reduction in immunoreactive staining of perivascular nerves did not correlate with the development of angiographic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
