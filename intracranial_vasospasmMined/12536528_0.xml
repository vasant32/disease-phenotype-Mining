<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury was established by a free-falling device, and the rabbits received Sco intraperitoneally at 5 minutes and 2 hours after brain injury respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to monitor cerebral blood flow velocity (CBV) and pulsatility index (PI) of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), the contents of malondiadehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and Evans blue (EB) were measured, and the pathological changes were observed in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This model consisted with the pathologic changes of accelerated brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sco reduced the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, EB and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, increased the activities of SOD, and improved cerebral blood flow following brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of brain injury, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> can cause neuron calcium overload, <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> free radical reaction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and increase blood-brain barry(<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">Scopolamine</z:chebi>, a muscarinic receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, can improve these pathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, Sco has protective effects on brain tissue injury </plain></SENT>
