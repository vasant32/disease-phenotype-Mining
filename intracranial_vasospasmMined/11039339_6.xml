<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The possibility of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> has increased the significance of its diagnosis and follow-up; however, so far, no ideal method is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography versus intraarterial angiography (IA-DSA) in detecting vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms (minimum, two per patient within 10 days after the event; total, 149) were obtained prospectively using a 3D time-of-flight technique covering the circle of Willis at 0.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms could be compared with intraarterial angiograms obtained within 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular narrowing on both studies was rated consensually by two pairs of neuroradiologists using a scale from 0 (no narrowing) to 3 (severe narrowing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Categories 0 and 1 were considered an absence of vasospasm and categories 2 and 3 a presence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Agreement between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and IA-DSA (assessed with weighted kappa statistics) was substantial for the middle and anterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA) but moderate for the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for detecting patients with vasospasm were 92%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering each vessel separately, specificity was high for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations (95-99%) and sensitivity was excellent for the ACA (100%) but poorer for the ICA (25%) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography at 0.5 T is capable of identifying vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH but is less sensitive than IA-DSA for depicting vasospasm in the ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
