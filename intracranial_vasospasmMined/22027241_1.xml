<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the final results of a randomized, open trial to compare the efficacy and safety of fasudil with nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 63 patients undergoing surgery for SAH received fasudil and 66 received nimodipine between 1998 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm, low density areas on computed tomography (CT), clinical outcomes, and adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded, and the results were compared between the fasudil and nimodipine groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74.5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61.7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events reported in the fasudil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH </plain></SENT>
