<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess maternal middle cerebral artery flow velocity patterns as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and to investigate the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi>) and phenytoin on cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective randomised study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: High care obstetric unit, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four eclamptic patients: 13 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> and 11 phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Middle cerebral artery flow velocity waveforms were measured using 2 MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound via the transtemporal approach in eclamptic patients, before and 15 minutes after the loading dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">Magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> significantly reduced the pulsatility index (P = 0.002) and mean flow velocity (P = 0.02) in the middle cerebral artery, whereas phenytoin failed to produce any statistically significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, differences between groups were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced in both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> and phenytoin groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings provide firm evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> relieves <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, compared with phenytoin, and may therefore be the better drug for the prevention of eclamptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
