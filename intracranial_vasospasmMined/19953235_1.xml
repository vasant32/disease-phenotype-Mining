<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">colforsin</z:chebi> daropate <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (CDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 29 patients with angiographically confirmed CV received intra-arterial CDH (IAC) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic changes in spastic vessels and the cerebral circulation time (CCT) were assessed before and after IAC treatment, together with the change in clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IAC treatment was performed in 53 procedures in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic improvement was observed following <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures (100%), and clinical improvement was observed following 36 of 42 procedures (86%) in symptomatic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCT improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the 3-month follow-up, 19 patients (66%) showed good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major adverse effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAC treatment was effective and safe for the treatment of CV after SAH </plain></SENT>
