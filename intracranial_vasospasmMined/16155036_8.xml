<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) causes vasodilatation in the skin of the head and neck because of regional sympathetic block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effects on cerebral haemodynamics, in health or in disease, are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of SGB on ipsilateral middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAFV), estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (eCPP), zero flow pressure (ZFP), carbon dioxide reactivity (CO2R) and cerebral autoregulation using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty male patients, with pre-existing brachial plexus injury, and undergoing SGB for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0458219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complex regional pain syndrome</z:e> of the upper limb, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For SGB, 10 ml of plain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 2% was used and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of block was confirmed by presence of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MCAFV, eCPP, ZFP, CO2R, and cerebral autoregulation were assessed before and after SGB using established TCD methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in these variables were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The block caused a significant decrease in MCAFV from median (inter-quartile range) value of 61 (53, 67) to 55 (46, 60) cm s(-1), a significant increase in eCPP from 59 (51, 67) to 70 (60, 78) mm Hg, and a significant decrease in ZFP from 32 (26, 39) to 25 (16, 30) mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in CO2R or cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increase in eCPP, decrease in ZFP, and no changes in CO2R or cerebral autoregulation suggest that the SGB decreases cerebral vascular tone without affecting the capacity of the vessels to autoregulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects may be of therapeutic advantage in relieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in certain clinical settings </plain></SENT>
