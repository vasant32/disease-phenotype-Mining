<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1990 and 1993, 84 patients were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in National Defense Medical College Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed for asymptomatic vasospasm in 18 patients and for symptomatic vasospasm in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial papaverine infusion was performed for asymptomatic vasospasm in 10 patients and for symptomatic vasospasm in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 40 patients were treated with standard conservative therapy including hypervolemic and hypertensive hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of these patients were analyzed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome tended to be better for patients treated with angioplasty, but not for those treated with papaverine infusion, than for those treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of vasospasm was more frequent after papaverine infusion than after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Undesirable complications such as abrupt development of unconsciousness were experienced during papaverine infusion but not during angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is superior to intra-arterial papaverine infusion for prevention and treatment of vasospasm following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
