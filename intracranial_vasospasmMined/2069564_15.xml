<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After intracisternal administration of big ET-1 (10 micrograms/dog), the caliber of the basilar artery on the angiogram was decreased to about 59% of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a marked increase in immunoreactive ET in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic arterial pressure was markedly elevated following big ET-1 injection </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that intracisternally administered big ET-1 is converted to ET-1 and that the generated ET-1 produces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A phosphoramidon-sensitive metalloproteinase appears to contribute to this conversion </plain></SENT>
