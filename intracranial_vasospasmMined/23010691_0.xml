<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Angiographic vasospasm (CVS) has been accused to be the main cause of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (DCI) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment success including endovascular treatment remains to be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a pattern analysis of ischemic lesions in SAH patients in the absence of angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> to generate further hypotheses concerning etiology and risk factors of DCI apart from vasospastic narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively included 309 patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was assessed by means of CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and perfusion measurement or digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical and radiological data were used to determine the most probable etiology for new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without presence of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of these "atypical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>" were induced by complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> therapy, 7 % by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, 2 % by ICP-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 17 %, the etiology remained unclear; however, disturbances of the microcirculation for different reasons were the most likely cause in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Beyond CVS and treatment complications, a not insignificant number of SAH patients suffered from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of other etiology probably due to disturbance of the microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic approaches for vasodilation of angiographic vasospasm alone should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
