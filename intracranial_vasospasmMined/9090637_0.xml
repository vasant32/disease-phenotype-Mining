<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have purified a [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i elevating factor from cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calcium-elevating protein factor was purified to homogeneity by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation and a combination of Mono Q, Superose 12, and Mono S columns using liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen microgram of the purified protein was obtained from 340 mg of cerebrospinal fluid proteins and the molecular mass of the protein was estimated to be 81 kDa by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that the purified protein was cross-reactive with anti-human transferrin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that transferrin may be involved with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
