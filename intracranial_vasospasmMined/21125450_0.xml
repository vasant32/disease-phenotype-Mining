<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: twenty male New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into four groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: (1) control [no SAH (n = 5)], (2) SAH only (n = 5), (3) SAH plus nimodipine (n = 5), and (4) SAH plus nicergoline (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: there was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameter and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 3 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 4 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> section areas in group 3 and group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that intrathecal nicergoline has a vasodilatatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits but not more than that of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
