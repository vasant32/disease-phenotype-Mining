<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen adult mongrel dogs (18-20 kg) were assigned to one of three experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received a total amount of 15 ml fresh unheparinized arterial blood via three injections into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective vertebral angiography was performed on day 0 and subsequently blood injections were performed on the 2nd and 3rd days after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 7th day angiography was reperformed to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first group (5 dogs) was the control group and received intrathecal saline which was equal to the amount of saline in which Iloprost was diluted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second group (5 dogs) did not receive any treatment until the 7th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third group (6 dogs) received Iloprost intrathecally (total 10 micrograms kg-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first two groups angiographic vasospasm was prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the second group intraarterial Iloprost was given on the 7th day in order to evaluate its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However there was no evidence of resolution of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the third group, resolution of vasospasm was verified on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electron microscope studies of basilar arteries of the first two groups revealed degenerative changes of the endothelial cells which were separated from each other and the elastic lamina was irregularly arranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the intrathecal Iloprost-treated group there was little thickening in the elastic lamina and the endothelial cells were almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results can be considered as the evidence of the prophylactic effect of Iloprost given by the intrathecal route in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
