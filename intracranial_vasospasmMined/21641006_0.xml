<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To present our experience in the diagnosis and intravascular treatment of cerebral pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 11 pseudoaneurysms (2 traumatic, 2 mycotic, 3 iatrogenic, and 4 with other causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyze the methods and diagnostic criteria, radiological and clinical outcome, the criteria used in making decisions about treatment, the method of treatment, and the complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebral pseudoaneurysms; the diagnostic criteria in the literature include: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with early morphological changes and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with another distal one, in the context of the right symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the nine patients treated with endovascular techniques, the treatment objective was achieved and rebleeding did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In cases with clinical suspicion of a pseudoaneurysm, the patient should undergo angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is especially important in patients with inexplicable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT angiography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography have good diagnostic accuracy and can replace conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the treatment of choice is endovascular and treatment should not be delayed unless access to the pseudoaneurysm is impeded, usually due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
