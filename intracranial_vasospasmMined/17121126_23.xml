<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing experimental evidence in animal models of SAH suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may ameliorate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that patients chronically treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> would have a decreased risk of symptomatic vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 115 patients with SAH who were consecutively admitted to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit of Duke University between 1998 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy to symptomatic vasospasm was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (13%) admitted with SAH were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy for at least 1 month before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (43%) experienced symptomatic vasospasm a mean of 5.8 +/- 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on admission (odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.77) was independently associated with an 11-fold reduction in the risk of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fisher Grade 3 SAH (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.50-5.71) and rupture of anterior cerebral or internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.29-10.91) were independently associated with an increased risk of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
