<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correlation between neurological deterioration and vasospasm has been reported previously, but delayed neurological deterioration secondary to vasospasm in head injury is a rare occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 57-year-old man who, after a motorcycle accident, developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and a thick subarachnoid deposition of blood in the left sylvian-insular cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgical evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, the patient improved until the 10th postoperative day, when he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated multitapering spasm, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed persistence of the cisternal deposition of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite therapy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, the patient improved only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of head injury with substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> producing vasospasm has been considered rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed posttraumatic vasospasm secondary to blood degradation products seems to play some role in the vasospasm after head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT scanning may be useful in predicting vasospasm in such patients, and digital subtraction angiography might be useful in demonstrating it </plain></SENT>
