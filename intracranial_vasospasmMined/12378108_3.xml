<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four adult red Burgundy rabbits wearing a cervical epidural electrode underwent cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional monitoring of early basilar spasm before and during cSCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF changes, as a consequence of cSCS, occurred in 20 control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No CBF changes, consistent with no basilar artery vasospasm, occurred after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) up to the end of the experiments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the stimulated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of reversible functional sympathectomy in mediating the effect of spinal cord stimulation on early spasm is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cSCS is able to prevent 'early spasm' due to SAH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals studied, independently from the occurrence and the sign of stimulation induced CBF variations </plain></SENT>
