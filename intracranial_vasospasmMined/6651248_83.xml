<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm, or delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated with arteriographic evidence of arterial constriction, is currently the most important cause of morbidity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of vasospasm is directly correlated with the presence of thick blood clots in the basal subarachnoid cisterns, which can be detected by an early computed tomographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm usually develops between 4 and 12 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is gradual, occurring over hours or days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is typically a gradual deterioration of the level of consciousness, accompanied by focal neurological deficits that are determined by the arterial territories involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo> frequently occurs and may exacerbate the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients are usually volume depleted, and therefore many authorities now treat them with replenishment and expansion of their intravascular volume with colloid and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volume expansion, together with elevation of the systemic blood pressure and reduction of the intracranial pressure when elevated, constitute the only currently available effective therapy for symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of vasospasm remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of smooth muscle cell contraction and relaxation and experimental efforts to elucidate the nature of vasospasm are reviewed </plain></SENT>
