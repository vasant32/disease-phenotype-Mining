<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DDS was implanted into the cisterna magna with autologous blood in the hirudin-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the angiographical diameter of the basilar artery was only 19% in the hirudin-treated group on day 7, showing a significant difference between hirudin-treated and nontreated groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that thrombin is an important cause of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collagen DDS has great potential for treatment in the cerebrospinal fluid milieu </plain></SENT>
