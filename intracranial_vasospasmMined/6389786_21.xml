<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was induced in 50 rabbits by injecting 1.25 cc/kg of autologous, well heparinized, fresh arterial blood into the cisterna magna, followed by suspending the animals in a head-down position at 30 degrees for 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were evenly divided into five groups: a control group, or groups receiving post-SAH prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>), carbacyclin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) synthetase inhibitor (OKY-1581), or nutralipid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiographic vertebrobasilar arterial spasm was demonstrated on the 3rd day post-SAH in the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was decreased in the prostacyclin and the carbacyclin groups and was absent in the OKY-1581 and the nutralipid groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements on the 4th day post-SAH using the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 technique failed to reveal any significant difference between the prostacyclin, the carbacyclin, and the control groups, but flows in the nutralipid and the OKY-1581 groups were significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the clinical status and the CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracytoplasmic vacuolation and detachment of the vascular endothelium, seen ultrastructurally, may account for the impaired synthesis of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous prostacyclin and carbacyclin decreased vasospasm but failed to improve cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OKY-1581 blocked the synthesis of the potent vasoconstrictor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>, which is not only formed during platelet aggregation but also induces platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nutralipid contains <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi>, a precursor of eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>), which is more potent in inhibiting platelet aggregation and in blocking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The various fatty acid constituents of nutralipid bind to albumin and thereby shorten the half-life of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
