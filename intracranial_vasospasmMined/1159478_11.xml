<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author used isolated rabbit common carotid and femoral arteries perfused at a constant pressure of 90 mm Hg to examine the variation of flow (F) with transmural pressure (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> was reduced below 50 to 60 mm Hg in arteries with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> smooth muscle tone, arterial resistance increased significantly causing a reduction in flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the diffuse arterial narrowing that occurs in patients with severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be the result of a similar reduction in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of active vasoconstriction, any increase in extraluminal (intracranial) pressure (ICP) resulted in a substantial increase in arterial resistance and subsequent reduction of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This F-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> relationship depended only on the initial degree of constriction and was independent of the vasoconstrictor used to achieve this constriction and of the artery in which this constriction was produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature suggests that human cerebral arteries normally exhibit only mild constrictions in response to subarachnoid blood during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a mild constriction in the absence of increased ICP or a moderate increase in ICP (45 mm Hg) in the absence of constriction produced minor reductions in arterial diameter and an average flow reduction of only 5% to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when ICP was increased to 45 mm Hg in the presence of a mild constriction, severe arterial narrowing resulted and flow was reduced by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial spasm is the result of a mild constriction which is amplified by the simultaneous occurrence of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phenoxybenzamine was found to be effective in reversing and preventing these contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement in flow produced by phenoxybenzamine decreased as the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> was reduced below 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects of both diffuse and local spasm on cerebral blood flow are discussed </plain></SENT>
