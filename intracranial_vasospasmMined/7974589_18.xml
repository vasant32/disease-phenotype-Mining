<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: (+/-)-SB 209670, a potent nonpeptide endothelin (ET) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was used to investigate the potential role of ET in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of (+/-)-SB 209670 were evaluated in isolated segments of canine posterior cerebral arteries in vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells in culture, and in the canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the canine basilar and anterior spinal arteries, (+/-)-SB 209670 caused a dose-related inhibition of contractile responses mediated by ET (KB = 4.6 nmol/L and apparent KB = 2.7 nmol/L, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of (+/-)-SB 209670 were mediated by inhibition of <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors since the ETB selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> sarafotoxin 6c did not contract these posterior cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(+/-)-SB 209670 also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition (IC50 = 1 nmol/L) of the mitogenic response induced by ET-1 in vascular smooth muscle cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the canine model of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, animals received intracisternal vehicle (saline) or (+/-)-SB 209670 (360 +/- 10 micrograms/d) via osmotic minipump for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 7, the cross-sectional areas in the (+/-)-SB 209670 group were significantly greater than those in the vehicle group in both the basilar artery (68% versus 27%) and anterior spinal artery (78% versus 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in blood pressure or heart rate were noted in the two groups, and the vasospasm in the vehicle group did not differ from that of historic controls in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ET plays a significant role in the development of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> via an interaction with <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
