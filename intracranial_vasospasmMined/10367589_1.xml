<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of levcromakalim, a K+ channel opener, on [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and the contractile force of basilar arteries obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> was increased more in the SAH group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levcromakalim decreased the resting [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and force more profoundly than did a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker, nicardipine, and these effects were more prominent in the SAH group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levcromakalim diminished the increases in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and contractile force induced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> more profoundly than nicardipine did, and these effects were equal in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of levcromakalim were not inhibited by iberiotoxin but were antagonized completely by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that levcromakalim-induced opening of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP)-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels reduces [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i more effectively than does nicardipine and that levcromakalim exerts the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effects under the condition in which large conductance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated K+ (BK) channels are blocked with iberiotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, K+ channel openers like levcromakalim may be useful drug candidates to treat delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
