<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidence and time course of flow velocity changes suggesting a vasospasm following post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) considering the intracranial pressure (ICP) in 38 SAH patients as compared to 30 patients with spontaneous SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first investigation was done within 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and regularly followed up during the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the index of cerebral circulatory resistance was calculated and the ICP was measured using an epidural transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between middle cerebral artery maximum mean flow velocity and the quantity of blood seen on a computed tomographic scan in patients with post-traumatic SAH indicates a similar pathogenetic mechanism of the development of vasospasm to that after spontaneous SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a significantly earlier occurrence of mean flow velocities over 120 cm/s following post-traumatic SAH irrespective of the ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional factors must be considered in the evaluation of these pathologically raised flow velocities after posttraumatic SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both SAH groups there was a highly significant correlation between clinical outcome and clinical grade on admission, ICP and resistance index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The weak correlation between maximum mean flow velocity and clinical outcome following post-traumatic SAH supports the notion that final clinical outcome of these patients is of multifactorial origin </plain></SENT>
