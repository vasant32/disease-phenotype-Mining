<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because it has been argued that active myogenic tone prolongs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> for &gt;2 wk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), we attempted to identify the mechanism that plays the main role in sustaining the prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We especially focused on the roles of biomechanical and phenotypic changes in the cerebral arteries in the mechanisms of prolonged vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the basilar arteries from a "two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" canine model to make serial measurements of maximal contraction capacity and arterial stiffness (papaverine-insensitive tone) until day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained vasospastic canine basilar arteries for histological changes and immunohistochemically examined them for expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms (SMemb, SM1, and SM2), which are markers of smooth muscle phenotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in collagen concentration in canine basilar arteries were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> persisted until day 14 and then gradually diminished; artery diameter returned to the control diameters on day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal contraction capacity decreased until day 21 and showed some recovery by day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness, on the other hand, progressed until day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed medial thickening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009025'>increased connective tissue</z:hpo> until day 21 and a return to control findings by day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009025'>increased connective tissue</z:hpo> was not accompanied by changes in collagen concentration, suggesting a role of some other protein in the increase in connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies with anti-SMemb, anti-SM1, and anti-SM2 antibodies showed enhanced expression of SMemb from day 7 to day 21 and disappearance of SM1 and SM2 on days 14 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The changes in myosin heavy chain isoform expression returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The above results indicate that biomechanical and phenotypic changes may play a pivotal role in sustaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> for &gt;2 wk after SAH, with minimal changes in active myogenic arterial tone </plain></SENT>
