<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at developing a sustained release formulation of Nimodipine (NIM) nanoparticles using the biodegradable polymers, poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> 50:50 and 85:15) as carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NIM is a widely used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> which has to be administered as an intravenous infusion for a prolonged period of 1-2 weeks in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sustained release biodegradable formulation would serve to replace this conventional therapy of continuous intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> nanoparticles were prepared by a modified precipitation method using high pressure homogenizer at 10,000 to 14,000 psi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 3(2) factorial design was applied for optimization of the formulation parameters and for studying the effect of two independent variables [drug: polymer ratio and concentration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> F 127)] on entrapment efficiency and mean particle size (response variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contour plots were plotted which gave a visual representation of the two variables on the dependent variables and also indicated non-linear relationship between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nanoparticles had particle size of 131+/-1.9 nm for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> 50:50 and 196+/-2.2 nm for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> 85:15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scanning Electron Microscopy studies indicated that nanoparticles had spherical shape with a regular surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nanoparticles had high entrapment efficiency (96.42+/-2.09% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> 50:50 and 94.50+/-1.25% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> 85:15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSC thermograms indicated that NIM was dispersed as an amorphous state in the nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro drug release from the lyophilized nanoparticles showed 94.35 +/- 3.8% NIM release from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> (50:50) nanoparticles and 63.32 +/- 4.6% release from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> (85:15) nanoparticles in 25 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The release was first ordered and fickian diffusion kinetics in both the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results indicate that NIM loaded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53374">PLGA</z:chebi> nanoparticles could be effective in sustaining its release for a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed to confirm its performance in vivo </plain></SENT>
