<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define more clearly the neuropathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> utilising single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral computerised tomography (CT) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study SETTING: The obstetric unit in King Edward VIII Hospital, a large tertiary referral centre in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Imaging and ultrasonographic investigations were performed within 48 hours postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced cerebral CT scans were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the women and SPECT scans were performed on 63 women using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) as a tracer of regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity waveforms were measured using 2 MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound via the transtemporal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abnormalities in SPECT scan, CT scan and TCD ultrasound findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPECT scanning revealed perfusion deficits in the watershed areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women, 75% of whom had concomitant deficits in the parieto-occipital areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypodensities (cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>) were reported in 38 CT scans (58.5%), with parieto-occipital involvement in 97.4% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased flow velocity measurements in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries were recorded in 36 (85.7%) women in whom TCD ultrasound was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pathophysiological mechanism of eclamptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> is primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> involving mainly the watershed areas and parieto-occipital lobes of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SPECT scanning has been shown to be superior to CT scanning and TCD ultrasonography in detecting neuropathophysiologic alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, each of the three investigative tools provide its own unique information and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three are necessary research techniques to improve our understanding of the neuropathophysiological mechanism of eclamptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
