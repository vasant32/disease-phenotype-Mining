<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effects of aging on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify age-related differences of vasospasm and of papaverine reactivity in the responses of basilar arteries after SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits receiving a single injection of arterial blood into the cisterna magna were divided into 3 groups: young (2 to 3 months old), adult (6 to 9 months old), and old (20 to 40 months old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar angiograms were obtained before SAH and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Papaverine was administrated selectively via the vertebral artery on day 2, and serial angiography was performed for up to 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel structures were assessed with light microscopy on days 1, 2, 4, and 7 after SAH and at 10, 30, and 60 minutes after papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality from SAH in old rabbits was 40%, whereas that of young and adult rabbits was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiograms revealed that SAH induced maximal constriction of the basilar arteries on day 2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, and the constrictions were significantly increased with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of spastic basilar arteries after intra-arterial papaverine administration significantly decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration of the efficacy of papaverine became significantly shorter with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter returned to the preinfusion value approximately 120, 60, and 30 minutes after infusion in young, adult, and old rabbits, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy in old rabbits showed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina not only in the basilar arteries but also in small arteries and intraparenchymal arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that aging increases the degree of vasospasm in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The impaired reactivity to papaverine with aging might imply the early transition of the aged vessel to the papaverine-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
