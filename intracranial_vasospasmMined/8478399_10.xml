<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spastic arteries at days 4 and 7, cytosolic PKC activity showed a decrease of 40-45% with no significant changes in membrane PKC activity as compared with nonspastic control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic PKC activity of the day 14 arteries returned toward the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control level with the remission of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of the PKC isoforms revealed that the amounts of PKC alpha and PKC epsilon but not PKC zeta were decreased in spastic arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of 20-kDa MLC phosphorylation was not increased in the spastic arteries at days 4 or 7 as compared with that in the nonspastic control arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that PKC activity and related membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism are altered in spastic basilar arteries after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
