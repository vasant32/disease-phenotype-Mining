<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five male New Zealand White rabbits were assigned randomly to 1 of 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals in group 1 (n=5) served as controls, group 2 (n=5) was the SAH-only group, group 3 (n=5) was treated with intravenous 10 mg/kg cilostazol, group 4 (n=5) was treated with 0.05 mg/kg intravenous nimodipine, and group 5 (n=5) served as the vehicle group and treated with a mixture of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> and phosphate buffer solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed from the brain stems and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vessels were measured using computer-assisted morphometry (SPOT for Windows Version 4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were performed using the Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basilar artery wall thicknesses in group 3 and 4 were smaller than the group 2 and this was statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial cross-sectional areas in group 3 and 4 were higher than group 2 and this was also statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that intravenous administration of both cilostazol and nimodipine significantly attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
