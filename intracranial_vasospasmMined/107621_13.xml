<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the effect of continuous intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> infusion on the diameter of the basilar artery in dogs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> experimentally induced by subarachnoid blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 consecutive dogs, 10 minutes after beginning intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> at 100 microgram/min and at other times during 120 minutes of infusion, the diameter of the basilar artery had increased from 75 +/- 2% of control value to 114 +/- 2% of control value (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 dogs, the basilar artery diameter during infusion was greater than the control value prior to creating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> caused only a moderate (8%) decrease in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
