<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into 3 groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were as follows: (1) sham operated (no SAH [n = 12]), (2) SAH only (n = 12), and (3) SAH plus RLX (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery lumen areas and arterial wall thickness were measured to assess vasospams in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements in the RLX-treated group was statistically significant (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between the SAH group and the SAH + RLX group was also statistically significant (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that RLX has marked vasodilatatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation may have clinical implications suggesting that this SERM drug could be used as possible anti-vasospastic agent in patients without major adverse effects </plain></SENT>
