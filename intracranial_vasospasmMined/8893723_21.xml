<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Striking inhibitory effects of experimental vasospasm were observed in the basilar artery (BA) in which the oligoDNAs were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vascular contraction was significantly inhibited by oligoDNAs after 20 minutes of hemolysate exposure, which suggested that ET synthesis started approximately 20 minutes after hemolysate stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of ppET-1 in the BA in which the spasm was inhibited was markedly suppressed at the transcription level </plain></SENT>
