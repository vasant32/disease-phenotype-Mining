<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> in patients with symptomatic refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eight patients diagnosed with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who developed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> refractory to conventional medical therapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received an intra-arterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> at a rate of 0.25 mg/min, with a total dose of 10-15 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative evaluation of angiographic response, neurological and systemic complications as well as functional outcome at 3 months were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a significant angiographic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was evidenced by a pre-treatment vessel stenosis greater than 70%, that improved to less than 50% after the intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed recurrent vasospasm that improved after a second intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed neurologic or systemic complications attributed to the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 months follow-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were alive and had a mean modified Rankin scale of 2 +/- 1 and a Barthel index of 83 +/- 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">Milrinone</z:chebi> infusion seems to be a safe and effective treatment for patients who develop refractory symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
