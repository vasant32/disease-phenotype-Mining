<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate the possible role of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent smooth muscle contraction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), employing the beagle "two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm was angiographically confirmed on day 7 in the basilar artery, which was exposed via the transclival approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The artery was superfused with aerated Krebs-Henseleit solution containing various agents, and the subsequent changes in the basilar artery diameter were recorded by successive angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preexisting spasm was not ameliorated by local application of neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, methysergide, phentolamine, and diphenhydramine), calmodulin inhibitors (R24571 and W-7), or a calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the application of PKC inhibitors such as H-7 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> induced significant dilation of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, an intrinsic PKC activator, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), in the basilar artery, the CSF, and the cisternal clot of beagles exposed to two <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> was measured on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 using the DAG kinase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On days 2, 4, and 7, the DAG content of the basilar artery showed a significant and prolonged increase (150-190% of control), whereas it was unchanged on days 1 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Throughout the experimental period, there was a significant linear correlation between the DAG content and the angiographical diameter of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The above results indicate that SAH leads to an increase in the DAG level within the cerebral artery through an as yet unknown mechanism and that subsequent activation of the PKC-dependent contractile system participates in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
