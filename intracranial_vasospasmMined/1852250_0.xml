<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present six cases of delayed traumatic symptomatic vasospasm along with CT scan and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases ranging in age from 16 to 78 years <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had head injury caused by traffic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale on admission was 9 - 15 except in one severe case GCS 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial CT scans were obtained on the day of injury in four patients and on the 2nd and 3rd days in the other two cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the suprasellar cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the Sylvian cistern was observed with particular care in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was mild (isodensity or slight high density by CT) in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp> on CT scan were observed in the temporal and/or frontal region of 5 of 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic symptoms occurred during the period between 5 and 13 days after head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cerebral angiogram taken after the occurrence of these symptoms revealed spasms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the spasm being bilateral in 2 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spasms were recognized on the main arteries at the base of the brain such as C1, M1, M2 and A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases, the cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and the spasm were located on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Angiographically the vasospasms lasted 2 to 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prognosis based on the Glasgow outcome scale was good recovery in 3 patients and moderate disability in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two elderly patients with bilateral spasms were in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> and severe disability, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
