<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the efficacy and safety of nimodipine as an alternative to papaverine for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> records, clinical charts and CT and angiographic images of 9 patients who had received intra-arterial nimodipine; 1 of these patients received both nimodipine and papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference in arterial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter before and after treatment was calculated as a percentage change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average dose of nimodipine administered per vessel was 3.3mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean increase in arterial diameter was 66.6% in the vasospastic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in blood pressure of any of the subjects during endovascular treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial nimodipine is effective in improving angiographic vasospasm complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies aimed at examining the clinical benefits of nimodipine are warranted, particularly in view of the low risk of adverse side effects of nimopidine when compared with papaverine </plain></SENT>
