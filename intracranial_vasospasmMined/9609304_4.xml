<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Monophosphoryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> (MPL) and diphosphoryl <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (DPL) are derivatives of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (endotoxin) of Salmonella minnesota strain R595 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monophosphoryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> is relatively nontoxic and can stimulate the natural defense or immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diphosphoryl <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> is relatively toxic; however, at higher concentrations, it can also stimulate an immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of these endotoxin analogs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intrathecal administration of MPL or DPL (5 microg/kg) was performed immediately before and 24 hours after induction of SAH in New Zealand White rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after induction of SAH, the animals were killed by perfusion fixation for morphometric analyses of vessels or perfused with saline and assayed for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional rabbits were administered MPL or DPL and killed 24 hours later for assessment of SOD activity; no SAH was induced in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH elicited spasm of the basilar arteries in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was markedly attenuated in animals treated with MPL (p &lt; 0.01 compared with vehicle-treated animals), but not in animals treated with DPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A substantial reduction in SOD activity in the basilar artery accompanied the vasospasm; this loss of activity was significantly blocked by treatment with MPL, but not DPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In animals that were not subjected to experimental SAH, MPL elicited a significant increase in SOD activity over basal levels, whereas DPL was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence of a marked protective effect of the endotoxin analog MPL against vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the protective effect of MPL remains to be verified, an enhancement of basal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity and an inhibition of SAH-induced loss of this activity are attractive candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An MPL-based therapy could represent a useful addition to current therapies for SAH-induced cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
