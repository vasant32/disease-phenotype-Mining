<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to test whether the systemic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi>, a nonpeptidic ET(A) and ETB receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, could reverse vasospasm without inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rabbits (single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model) and in dogs (double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model), SAH was induced; after vasospasm was established, the animals received intravenously either saline or a 30 mg/kg bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of the basilar artery was analyzed by quantitative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rabbits (n = 13), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> reversed basilar vasospasm to the same extent as did an intravertebral injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In dogs (n = 10), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> reversed only 52 +/- 10% of the vasospasm reversible by papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">Bosentan</z:chebi> did not alter the heart rate or the arterial blood pressure in either the rabbits or the dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cerebrospinal fluid, SAH increased endothelin-1 (ET1) and big ET1 by 6 and 3.8 times, respectively; in the basilar artery, SAH increased ET1 concentration, big ET1 concentration, and ET-converting enzyme activity by 1.3, 2, and 2.7 times, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a local involvement of ET was also suggested by the relaxing effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51450">bosentan</z:chebi> on basilar artery rings from rabbits with SAH and not from control rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receptor binding studies performed on dog basilar arteries revealed a shift in the phenotype expression of ET receptors from the A to the B type after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ET plays a major role in SAH and that systemic ET blockade might selectively dilate spastic arteries </plain></SENT>
