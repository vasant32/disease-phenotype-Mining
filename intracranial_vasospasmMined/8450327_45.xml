<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that these agents might, therefore, be useful in ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and its ischemic consequences which frequently complicate SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was tested in an arm of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous nicardipine in patients with recently ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participating investigators were required to send selected copies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> admission and follow-up angiograms obtained between Days 7 and 11 following <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (the peak period of risk for vasospasm) to the Central Registry of the Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> Study for blinded interpretation and review for the presence and severity of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In centers with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) capabilities, middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) mean flow velocities were measured and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiograms obtained between Days 7 and 11 were available for 103 (23%) of 449 patients receiving nicardipine and 121 (26%) of 457 receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a balance of prognostic factors for vasospasm between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one percent of placebo-treated patients had moderate or severe vasospasm on "Day 7-11 angiograms" compared to 33% of nicardipine-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven (49%) of 137 placebo-treated patients examined with TCD between Days 7 and 11 had mean <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocities exceeding 120 cm/sec compared to 26 (23%) of 112 nicardipine-treated patients (significant difference, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that high-dose intravenous nicardipine reduces the incidence and severity of delayed cerebral arterial narrowing in patients following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
