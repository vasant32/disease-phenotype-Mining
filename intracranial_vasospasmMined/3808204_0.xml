<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of subarachnoid clots surrounding the cerebral arteries may be one of the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is agreed that there is a correspondence between the site of subarachnoid clots and the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors have already reported that the appearance and severity of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were not affected by calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (Diltiazem), but the prognosis improved significantly for 105 patients (especially Hunt-Hess grade II and III) at the 3-month follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the above 105 patients, each with a ruptured supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, were classified preoperatively according to Fisher's CT grading system and the effect of Diltiazem was re-examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in Hunt-Hess grade V were excluded and the duration of treatment with Diltiazem was 2 weeks following the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>105 cases (Diltiazem) were compared as a control group with 100 cases who were operated on before the administration of Diltiazem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occurrence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> tended to decline in patients with a CT grade of 2 or 3, and the prognosis improved significantly for 105 patients including 32 cases with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results here indicate that Diltiazem might be especially effective for patients of Hunt-Hess grade II and III with CT grades of 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
