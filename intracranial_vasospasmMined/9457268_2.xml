<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), basilar artery spasm has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) dilate rat basilar artery in vivo, we tested whether systemic administration of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) can reverse the basilar artery spasm following rat SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was mimicked by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a digital substraction angiography system in order to evaluate the spasmolytic effect of aFGF administered via the axillary artery 7 minutes after the injection of the autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals received vehicle solution in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraarterial bolus injection of 2.6 micrograms aFGF, but not the solvent, reverses the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e> caused by SAH (23.05% of the baseline value at 5 minutes post-SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an important role for FGFs in the cerebral tone regulation and support a clinical interest of FGFs in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following SAH, particularly if these vasoactive effects are added to the known neuroprotective effects of FGFs </plain></SENT>
