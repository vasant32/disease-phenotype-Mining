<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to be primary in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, as direct evidence of ROS has not yet been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we sought to substantiate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-)) generation in the subarachnoid space after SAH using a modification of Karnovsky's <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>/diaminobenzidine (Mn(2+)/DAB) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH or sham operation was induced according to a 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in a total of 24 beagle dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 2 or 7 after SAH or sham operation, dogs were intrathecally infused with buffer containing Mn(2+) and DAB, and the brain stem was prepared for light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible colocalization of ferrous (Fe(2+)) or ferric (Fe(3+)) iron ions with.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) was also examined with the use of Turnbull blue or Berlin blue staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed amorphous, amber deposits within the subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, the periarterial space, and the tunica adventitia of the basilar artery on days 2 and 7 after SAH.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) deposits were eliminated by addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase or exclusion of either Mn(2+) or DAB from the perfusate, confirming the specificity of the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These deposits were colocalized with blue reaction deposits indicating Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the subarachnoid space,.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) indicating electron-dense fine granules were preferentially located around degenerated erythrocytes and, secondarily, infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show direct evidence for enhanced production of.<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) and Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) iron ions in the subarachnoid space after SAH, lending further support to the pathogenic role of ROS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
