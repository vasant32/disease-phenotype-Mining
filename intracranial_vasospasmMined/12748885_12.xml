<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is likely to be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the adventitia of large cerebral arteries to blood breakdown products initiates a cascade of changes in both <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and vasomotor regulation of the exposed vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> process is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal cerebral vascular tone requires the continuous release of NO, nevertheless NO is involved in free radical mediated injury of endothelial cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (stabile endproducts of NO metabolism) were studied in cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (cCSF) in patients suffering from aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 21 patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, cisternal drainage of CSF and intravenous nimodipine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients as well as tripple H therapy when indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCDS was performed on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean flow velocity of more than 150 cm/sec and the development a delayed neurological deficit was defined as vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were collected on the day of surgery and for the 7 days following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NO-M (<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate) were measured using a commercially available test kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 5 of 21 patients developed clinically symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in NO levels between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> showed significantly higher levels of NO-M in CSF than patients with a uncomplicated follow-up between day 2 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our preliminary results indicate that SAH leads to an increase in NO-M in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This increase of NO-M significantly correlates with the flow velocities in TCDS measurement suggesting that NO plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
