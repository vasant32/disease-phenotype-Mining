<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor, effectively suppresses induction of ET-1 in the rat vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was injected around the right femoral artery and the left one was used as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days later (day 7), diameters of the right femoral arteries narrowed to about 60% and this vasoconstriction was prevented by clinical dose (0.6 mg/kg) or one third of its dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> injected on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that expression of ET-1 mRNA in the vasospastic artery was not detected in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> effectively inhibits aberrant expression of ET-1 in the vasospasm-destined artery in the rat </plain></SENT>
