<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are complex and interrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies that focused on only one of these mechanisms have proved to be ineffective in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a therapeutic target is desirable that can interrupt the multi-mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been shown to be a key regulator in reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, inflammatory damage, and accumulation of toxic metabolites, which are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved in SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, whether Nrf2 is activated in the cerebral artery after SAH hasn't been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 30 male rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n = 15) and SAH group (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The animals in the SAH group were subjected to injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of the basilar artery was measured and the nuclear Nrf2 protein level was studied by Western blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of nuclear Nrf2 protein was increased remarkably in the SAH group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that high level expression of Nrf2 was present in endothelial and smooth muscle cells; it was located in both the nuclei and cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that Nrf2 expression is up-regulated in the cerebral artery of rats after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
