<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, in concentrations of 1 ml of autologous arterial blood/1 kg of body weight was carried out on 18 New Zealand rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological specimens were obtained by the method of perfusion fixation after the rabbits were sacrificed on day 8 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spastic effect of experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was determined by assessing the intensity of corrugation of the intima of the rabbit basilar artery by the previously developed method of corrugation coefficient and computer image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration and localization of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>-containing neurons was immunohistochemically assessed (semiquantitatively as 0, 1 and 2) with anti-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase, at precisely defined sites of the hypothalamus and brain stem of the same rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed less corrugated and smoother intima in the basilar artery and significantly lower <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase concentration in the control group of rabbits with sham <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and without any additional interventions (mean corrugation coefficient=1.123+/-0.024, P=0.35 x 10(-3); mean <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase=0.350+/-0.071, P=0.22 x 10(-3)), and smoother intima in the basilar artery with significantly lower concentration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> group (rabbits with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and central alpha(2)-blocker <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> at a daily dose of 0.03 mg/kg of body weight for 8 days; mean corrugation coefficient=1.177+/-0.058, P=1.7 x 10(-3); mean <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase=0.583+/-0.175, P=1.1 x 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the haemorrhage only group (rabbits with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and without medication; mean corrugation coefficient=1.370+/-0.101; mean <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase=1.214+/-0.313) displayed intensive corrugation of the intima of the basilar artery and a significantly more intensive accumulation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase than did the control group and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrated that the central alpha(2)-blocker <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> effectively prevents vasospasm, and diminishes the concentration of cerebral <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> beta-hydroxylase in the hypothalamus and brain stem after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
