<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: it is hypothesized that free radical reactions evoked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (oxyHb) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), even though the detailed mechanisms have not yet been fully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were thus to investigate, through the use of the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rabbit model, the possibility that free radical reactions play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to delineate the mechanism of signal transduction that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: in the SAH group, SAH was simulated using the double-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rabbit model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (0.6 mg/kg), a potent free radical scavenger, was injected into the central ear vein twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four days after SAH, the basilar artery was excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was evaluated by measuring the diameter of each basilar artery, and the expression of Rho-kinase in the vascular wall was examined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the diameter of the basilar artery in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group was 0.64 ± 0.06 mm, which was statistically significantly larger than that in the nontreated SAH group (0.50 ± 0.03 mm; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of Rho-kinase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi>-treated group was statistically significantly reduced in comparison to that of the nontreated SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: results from this study have indicated for the first time that free radical reactions mediated by oxyHb may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> through the expression of Rho-kinase </plain></SENT>
