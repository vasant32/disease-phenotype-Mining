<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daily intra-venous administration of dilazep (0.3 mg/kg for one hour) significantly inhibited angiographic vasospasm (percent reduction of intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter; 33.2%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dilazep had a marked vasodilatory effect even in severe vasospasm in untreated dogs, and had a tendency to increase cerebral blood flow of the cerebral cortex in spite of <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
