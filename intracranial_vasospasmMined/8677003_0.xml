<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RBC aggregation rate was monitored in 38 patients who underwent early aneurysmal clipping surgery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intravascular factors (hematocrit, serum albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen, IgG) that influence RBC aggregation were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RBC aggregation rate increased on days 5-7 but decreased significantly as a result of hypervolemic hemodilution therapy (H-H therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hematocrit level was also reduced by H-H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum albumin concentration decreased and the serum alpha 2-macroglobulin concentration increased significantly on days 5-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After H-H therapy, the serum albumin concentration increased and the serum alpha 2-macroglobulin concentration decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG and plasma fibrinogen concentrations did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is known that albumin decreases and alpha 2-macroglobulin increases RBC aggregability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has become apparent that serum albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin play important roles in the determination of RBC aggregability after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the improvement in RBC aggregability induced by H-H therapy is effective for reversing progressive neurological deterioration due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
