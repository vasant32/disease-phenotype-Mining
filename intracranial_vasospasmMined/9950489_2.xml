<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prescribed use at 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days is based on reputable, randomized prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because only 20 to 30% of patients with SAH suffer clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, it is clear that most patients do not actually need the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of course, this fact is not evident until several treatment days have passed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is common practice, without well-documented consequences, to terminate nimodipine therapy before 21 days in certain clinical circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of abbreviating the duration of nimodipine treatment in the setting of a good-grade aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective clinical review was made of 90 consecutive patients who experienced a Hunt and Hess Grade I through III aneurysmal SAH and were treated with nimodipine for 15 days or less </plain></SENT>
