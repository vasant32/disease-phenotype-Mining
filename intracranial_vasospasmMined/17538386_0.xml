<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 2A receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> have not been studied in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the efficacy of ATL-146e in the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> and attenuation of posthemorrhagic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rodent femoral artery model of vasospasm was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four different groups (vehicle, 1 ng/kg/min, 10 ng/kg/min, or 100 ng/kg/min ATL-146e administered via subcutaneous osmotic minipump) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was evaluated at posthemorrhage Day 8 (period of peak constriction) by calculating the lumen cross-sectional area (expressed as percent change in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area: ratio of blood-exposed vessel to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline-exposed vessel) and radial wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody to detect leukocytes was used to evaluate localized <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant vasospasm was noted in the vehicle-treated (blood-exposed) control group (78.5%, P &lt; 0.001; expressed as a ratio of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area of the saline [no blood] control), but not in the ATL-146e-treated groups (lumen ratio to control: 105.0, 83.4, and 91.3% for the 1, 10, and 100 ng/kg/min groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced significantly and radial wall thickness was decreased in the ATL-146e-treated groups compared with the vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective activation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 2A receptor with ATL-146e prevented posthemorrhagic vasospasm and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> in this experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This agent is worthy of further investigation and lends credence to the hypothesis supporting a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
