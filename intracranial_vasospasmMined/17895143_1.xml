<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPECT revealed blood flow improvements in 42% of patients with papaverine treated vessels and 70% of patients with balloon angioplasty (P=.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCD correlated with SPECT in 71% of patients in the papaverine group and 73% of patients in the balloon angioplasty group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD showed 93% of segments improved by angioplasty, whereas 43% of segments were improved with papaverine (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disagreements were largely represented by patients with TCD velocity improvements in which SPECT blood flow imaging was, unchanged or worsened </plain></SENT>
