<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim to investigate the changes of cerebral microcirculation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was performed in 85 patients with SAH and 35 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) were recorded for final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> parameters were compared between (1) SAH group and control group, (2) CVS group and non-CVS group (nCVS), (3) symptomatic CVS (sCVS) group and asymptomatic CVS (asCVS) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to control group, there were significant differences in CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> of SAH patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among SAH patients, the CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (a decreased CBF and a prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) of CVS patients were significantly different from those of non-CVS patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 46 CVS patients, sCVS group presented significantly lower CBF and more prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> than asCVS patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven cases with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> between 6.31 and 12.72 s showed delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND), two of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> examination contributes to uncover the changes of cerebral microcirculation after SAH, and the changes of cerebral microcirculation are associated with CVS post SAH </plain></SENT>
