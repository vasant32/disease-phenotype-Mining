<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (SCVS) is still lacking in reliable early warning methods and often diagnosed after clinical deterioration of neurological function, making prevention and treatment extremely passive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the risk factors relevant to SCVS after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in order to provide useful information for clinical work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: clinical data of 211 patients with SAH was reviewed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>16 risk factors relevant to SCVS were retrospectively analyzed, including univariate analysis and logistic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: of 211 patients, 81 were found to have SCVS (38.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, Hunt-Hess grade at admission, modified Fisher grade, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and intraventricular blood clot reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that they might be risk factors to SCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, logistic analysis showed that only age (OR=1.027, 95% CI=1.002-1.053, P &lt; 0.05) and modified Fisher grade (OR=2.985, 95% CI=2.048-4.352, P &lt; 0.05) entered the regression equation, suggesting both were independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SCVS is the final result of multiple factors acting together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age and modified Fisher grades are independent risk factors to SCVS </plain></SENT>
