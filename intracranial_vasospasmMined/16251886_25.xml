<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we hypothesized that inhibition of ERK1/2 alters the ET(B) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(1B) receptor upregulation and at the same time prevents the sustained cerebral blood flow (CBF) reduction associated with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ERK1/2 inhibitor SB386023-b was injected intracisternally in conjunction with and after the induced SAH in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 2 days after the SAH, cerebral arteries were harvested for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and analysis of contractile responses to endothelin-1 (ET-1; ET(A) and ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-carboxamidotryptamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-CT</z:chebi>; 5-HT1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) in a sensitive myograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate if ERK1/2 inhibition had an influence on the local and global CBF after SAH, an autoradiographic technique was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 48 h after induced SAH, global and regional CBF were reduced by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reduction was prevented by treatment with SB386023-b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ERK1/2 inhibition also decreased the maximum contraction elicited by application of ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48292">5-CT</z:chebi> in cerebral arteries compared with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, ERK1/2 inhibition downregulated ET(B) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(1B) receptor messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> and protein levels compared with the SAH </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that ERK1/2 inhibition might be a potential treatment for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> associated with SAH </plain></SENT>
