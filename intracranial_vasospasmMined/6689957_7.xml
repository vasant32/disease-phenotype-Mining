<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alpha-thrombin failed to elicit contraction in the mesenteric artery, produced inconsistent effects in the renal artery, and produced biphasic effects (relaxation superseded by contraction) in the coronary and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the basilar artery the relaxation induced by alpha-thrombin was blocked and the maximal contractions enhanced by reaming the vessel or by substituting heated thrombin for alpha-thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results support the hypotheses that alpha-thrombin acts on two distinct receptors in the basilar artery and that it is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
