<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> activity of antithrombin III on rabbit arteries was first assessed in vitro using a myograph-arterial ring preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III (10 IU/ml) induced a 55.4% +/- 2.66% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) relaxation in basilar artery precontracted with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) in five specimens as compared with a 9.8% +/- 1.6% relaxation of common carotid artery in six specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For in vivo analysis, 21 New Zealand White male rabbits were separated into three groups: Group 1 served as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; Group 2 received a subarachnoid blood injection (SAH) and were sacrificed on Day 3 thereafter; and Group 3 animals were subjected to SAH, then received a 2-hour intracisternal infusion of antithrombin III (100 IU) in saline prior to sacrifice on Day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery caliber was determined using a morphometric method to analyze perfusion-fixed arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control basilar artery diameter in Group 1 was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 a 27% reduction in arterial caliber to 0.47 +/- 0.03 mm was observed by Day 3 post SAH (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 3 animals had a mean basilar artery diameter of 0.68 +/- 0.02 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was significantly larger than the untreated SAH rabbits in Group 2 (p less than 0.0001), but not different from control artery diameters in Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings demonstrate that antithrombin III in saline has a significant ability to reverse delayed narrowing of the rabbit basilar artery after SAH </plain></SENT>
