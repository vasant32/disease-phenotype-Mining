<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">Leukotrienes</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxyperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid are part of this group of substances, resulting from the 5-lipoxygenase activity on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761, a new 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi>, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in an in vivo rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 48 rabbits were assigned to one of six groups: SAH + placebo (n = 8), SAH + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761 20 mg/kg (n = 8), SAH + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761 30 mg/kg (n = 8), control + placebo (n = 8), control + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761 20 mg/kg (n = 8), and control + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761 30 mg/kg (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug administration was initiated 30 minutes after induction of SAH and repeated 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed 48 hours after SAH, using the perfusion-fixation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cross sectional areas of basilar artery histological sections were measured by an investigator blinded to the treatment groups of the individual samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In placebo-treated animals, the average <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross sectional area of the basilar artery was reduced by 68% after SAH as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the vasospastic response was attenuated in animals treated with 20 or 30 mg/kg representing a 28 or 35% reduction, respectively (P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-761 is effective in attenuating experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, indicating that this new drug represents a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
