<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, ET receptors' expression in the basiliar artery during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) were investigated using immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a rat SAH model of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (DCVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of the basilar artery in the SAH model group decreased in 2-3 days, and then gradually returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ET(A) receptor expression in endothelial cells of the basilar artery increased in day 2 after SAH, peaked at day 3 and remained increased till day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET(B) receptor expression increased significantly in endothelial cells at day 3, peaked at day 7 and remained until day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR result also revealed increased expressions of similar trends, but the expression of ET(B) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level tended to increase earlier than the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When PKC inhibitor (RO-31-7549, 10(-6) mol/L, 50 Î¼l) was administered 1, 6, 24, 32, 48 and 70 hours before cisternal injection, the expressions of the two ET receptors after day 3 decreased to varying degrees, while the vascular cross-sectional area was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the ET(A)/ET(B) receptors play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Application of RO-31-7549 reduced the expression of ET receptors and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, suggesting that inhibition of PKC signaling pathway could effectively reduce DCVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
