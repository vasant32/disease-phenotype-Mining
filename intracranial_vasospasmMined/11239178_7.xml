<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> remain unclear, and the discrepancy between ultrasonographic or angiographic evidence of arterial narrowing and neurological ischemic deficit is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most blood flow studies have been involved with large arteries, and thus, very little is known regarding the hemodynamic behavior of small perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic vasospasm, however, often present with neurological signs suggesting involvement of deep-sited areas of the brain supplied by perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A pulsatile pump was set to provide an outflow of 350 mL/min through a 10-mm-diameter C-flex tube at a perfusion pressure of 130/80 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The perfusion fluid used was prepared to approximate blood viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perforating arteries were simulated by a 1-mm tube connected to the parent tube at a 90 degrees angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cylindrical stenotic devices of decreasing diameters were then introduced into the parent tube at the level of the aperture of the secondary tube and 1.5 diameters upstream of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Velocity profiles both proximal and distal to the stenosis in the parent tube were obtained with a newly developed ultrasonographic flowmeter that allows for high spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing stenosis resulted in decreased outflow in the main tube, although it was significant only with severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whenever the simulated stenosis was placed upstream of the secondary tube, flow reduction was associated with a progressive change in the velocity profile, which gradually changed from laminar conditions to a jet stream limited to the center of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further diameter reduction was responsible for the occurrence of flow separation with retrograde flow velocities in the periphery of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the secondary tube, flow reduction was much more pronounced and began at a lesser degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increasing fluid viscosity and decreasing perfusion pressure enhanced flow separation and prominently affected the outflow in the secondary tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conversely, whenever the simulated stenosis involved the branching area of the secondary tube, there was a slightly progressive decrease in the relative flow in the main tube as the stenosis became tighter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When the stenosis equaled the diameter of the secondary tube, the relative contribution of the secondary tube increased markedly at the expense of the main tube outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> induces changes in postvasospastic velocity profile affecting the shear rate and may eventually lead to flow separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may, in turn, result in a venturi-like effect over the aperture of perforating arteries branching out of the postvasospastic portion of the affected parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These alterations of cerebral hemodynamics may account for at least part of the vasospasm symptomatology, especially in the vertebrobasilar system, where vasospasm is commonly focal rather than diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these changes proved to be affected significantly by manipulations of pressure and viscosity, supporting the use of hyperdynamic therapy in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
