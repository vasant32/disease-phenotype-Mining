<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen individuals (Group A) were operated on within 48 hours, while the other 18 (Group B) had surgery between 49 and 96 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients represented two clinically comparable groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first 72 hours post-SAH, no increased flow velocities suggestive of arterial narrowing or vasospasm were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in preoperative flow velocities between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative flow velocities were significantly lower in patients operated on within 48 hours (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients, who had surgery on Day 4 post-SAH and who showed the highest recorded postoperative flow velocities, died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results favor a referral system which enables early surgical intervention not only to prevent rebleeds but also aimed at reducing delayed ischemic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
