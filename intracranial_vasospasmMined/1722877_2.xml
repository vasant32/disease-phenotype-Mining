<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere to the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was surgically evacuated and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> perforating arteries were resected for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scans showed the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> to be unusually extended compared to those after hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological examination showed various degenerative changes in the elastic lamina and media of the perforating arteries, even though most patients were young and normotensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that patients who have suffered severe cerebral angiospasm may have a higher risk for subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> than those without prior angiospasm </plain></SENT>
