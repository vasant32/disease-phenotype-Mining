<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors measured the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and iron, which are by-products of HO-1, and the ferritin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in 39 consecutive patients with aneurysmal SAH of Fisher computed tomography group III, and determined the relationship between these by-products of HO-1 or ferritin and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of 39 patients (35.9%) developed asymptomatic vasospasm, while 6 patients (15.4%) developed symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of ferritin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and iron were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly elevated after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of ferritin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were significantly higher in patients with no vasospasm than in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic vasospasm on days 5 through 7 (P&lt;0.05, respectively) and on days 11 through 14 (P&lt;0.025 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed in the iron levels between these patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid after SAH were associated with no vasospasm in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that the induction of HO-1 and ferritin may be an intrinsic regulatory mechanism that acts against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
