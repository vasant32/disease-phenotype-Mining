<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT:: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is characterized by prolonged severe constriction of the basilar artery, which often leads to ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Locally elevated concentrations of spasmogenic substances induce persistent depolarization of myocytes in the basilar artery, leading to continuous influx of calcium (Ca) through voltage-sensitive Ca channels and myocyte contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> (K) channel openers may have therapeutic utility to oppose membrane depolarization, dilate the arteries, and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the involvement of vascular Kv7 K channels in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and tested whether Kv7 channel openers are effective therapeutic agents in a rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp experiments revealed that 3 different spasmogens (<z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, endothelin, and vasopressin) suppressed Kv7 currents and depolarized freshly isolated rat basilar artery myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were significantly reduced in the presence of a Kv7 channel opener, retigabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retigabine (10 Î¼M) also significantly blocked L-type Ca channels, reducing peak inward currents by &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of a selective Kv7 channel blocker, XE991, the spasmogens did not produce additive constriction responses measured using pressure myography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kv7 channel openers (retigabine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>) significantly attenuated basilar artery spasm in rats with experimentally induced SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identify Kv7 channels as common targets of vasoconstrictor spasmogens and as candidates for therapeutic intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
