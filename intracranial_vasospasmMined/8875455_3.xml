<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A red blood cell lysate was added to bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro to determine whether hemolysate can trigger tyrosine kinase mediated cell signalling and if so, whether this signal is independent of the elevation of intracellular free calcium levels, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemolysate was found by Western blotting to induce a dose dependent increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, approximately 60 and 110 kD, that was maximal between 1 and 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biphasic increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induced by hemolysate consists of a peak complete within 1 min which is the result of release of intracellular calcium stores and a plateau phase due to an influx of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of hemolysate to cells in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> indicated that an extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx is not required for the increases in tyrosine phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Release of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> stores by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, was, however, found to increase the phosphotyrosine content of the same 60 and 110 kD proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi>, tyrphostin 25 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, before exposure to hemolysate blocked the plateau phase of the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i response indicating that tyrosine kinase activity is required for the influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and phosphotyrosine mediated cell signalling induced by hemolysate in endothelial cells may be activated by a single component but represent distinct targets for possible control of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
