<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies attempting to establish the safety and efficacy of standard and high-dose intra-arterial infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> have focused on hemodynamic changes during the angiographic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longer-term drug effects over the hours following infusion and the effects on brain tissue oxygen tension or cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 11 patients with poor-grade aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> who underwent multimodality brain monitoring and angiography with infusion of high-dose intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (≥15 mg total dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hourly intracerebral microdialysis measurements and continuously recorded mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and Pbto₂ were analyzed for 6 hours before and 12 hours following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A median dose of 23 mg (range, 15-55 mg) of intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline values, reductions in CPP and MAP were maximal at 3 hours postangiography (from 105 ± 13 mm Hg to 95 ± 15 mm Hg and from 116 ± 12 mm Hg to 106 ± 16 mm Hg, P &lt; .01) and persisted for up to 6 hours (P &lt; .04); increases in vasopressor therapy were required in 8 procedures (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP significantly increased during the first 3 hours post angiography (P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased by 33% by hour 9 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in Pbto₂ or the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-dose intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> causes increases in ICP and reductions in CPP, followed by an increase in brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, without altering brain oxygen tension or oxidative metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing high-dose intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> therapy warrant close hemodynamic and ICP monitoring for at least 12 hours following treatment </plain></SENT>
