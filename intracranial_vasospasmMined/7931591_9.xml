<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been utilized in an attempt to reverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent angiographic results have demonstrated significant reversal of vasospasm in large vessels after selective intra-arterial application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>; however, these impressive results lacked good clinical correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> dibutyrate was used to stimulate protein kinase C in an in vitro model of cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Papaverine was found to elicit a dose-dependent exacerbation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> dibutyrate-induced microvascular constriction in this model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because protein kinase C is thought to play a key role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction represents a potentially important deleterious effect that may not be apparent on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such a constrictor response may compromise the beneficial vasodilatory effect seen with intra-arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
