<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Vasospasm as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is a major concern in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systemic drugs in current use are of limited value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical, intrathecal, or intraarterial papaverine administered during surgical or angiographic procedures is a potent vasodilating drug; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> limits its systemic application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local application of papaverine in a biodegradable controlled- or sustained-release matrix is proposed for vasospasm prophylaxis to be used in patients scheduled for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Controlled-release papaverine (PapaCR) drug pellets were prepared using the biodegradable aliphatic polyester poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) as the carrier matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro tests were performed to determine drug kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventeen patients, 73 assigned to the control group and 44 assigned to the PapaCR-treated group, participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who were deemed to be at high risk for the development of vasospasm were selected to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, drug pellets were placed in cisterns over arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients, cerebrospinal fluid was sampled every 6 hours for the first 5 days through a lumbar catheter that had been inserted at the beginning of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of clinical vasospasm and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores in the patients were evaluated statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of in vitro studies showed that effective local concentrations of papaverine could be maintained for more than 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The first-degree drug-release profile was demonstrated using this design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies no adverse effects due to the drug were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PapaCR effectively prevented development of clinical vasospasm. and outcome scores were significantly better in patients in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Local application of controlled- or sustained-release papaverine can be safely used in preventing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
