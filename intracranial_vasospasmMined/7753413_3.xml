<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can occur after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), it is important to evaluate borderline perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of borderline vascular insufficiency is important to reduce ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study 25 patients with SAH were investigated by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), computed tomography (CT), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to predict borderline ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical grades were also correlated with these investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had symptomatic vasospasm and 15 patients had angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed hypoperfusion in 22 out of 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT predicted CVS in 8 of these 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that brain perfusion SPECT is a non-traumatic, non-invasive, non-allergic, inexpensive method for the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that brain SPECT with Tc-99m HM-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> is an accessible technique that can demonstrate varying degrees of regional tissue hypoperfusion in patients with delayed ischemic deficits due to CVS following SAH </plain></SENT>
