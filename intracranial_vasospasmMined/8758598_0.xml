<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>New therapies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> aim to prevent the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects result in red blood cell haemolysis and release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi>, free radicals formation and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidations, imbalance in endothelial modulation of vasomotor tone and activation of the complement system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low doses of fibrinolytic agents administered intrathecally accelerate the fibrinolysis of the clot and reduce the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissue-type plasminogen activator has proven to be effective in preventing vasospasm, but the modalities of this therapy remain to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Free radical reactions may be inhibited by free radical scavengers and inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tirilazad is a potent inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidations, which improves the patients' outcome and has gone to Phase III human trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and tropolone derivatives are currently evaluated in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasomotor tone can be modified in experimental models either by blocking endothelin receptors (BQ-123), or by facilitating the release and enhancing the effect of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitors</z:chebi>, drugs that increase intracellular calcium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22450,38615">cyclopiazonic acid</z:chebi>, LP-805) and free radicals scavengers (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These possibilities are being investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, preliminary studies have demonstrated the efficacy of FUT-175, an inhibitor of the complement system, in the prevention of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the next years, these new therapies have to be validated by prospective and randomized clinical trials to propose guidelines for the management of patients at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
