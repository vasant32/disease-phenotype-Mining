<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that one of their stable breakdown products, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>), is the major lipoxygenase product released from isolated cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the vascular cell type responsible for their production we have established the culture of smooth muscle cells from cerebral arteries and have measured their release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETEs</z:chebi> upon stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cultured cells isolated from bovine cerebral arteries expressed smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> as they stained positively for smooth muscle alpha-actin and not factor VIII-related antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these cells possessed the calcium and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> conductances characteristic of smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, the major lipoxygenase product was 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi>; no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The formation of 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> was concentration-dependent and was attenuated by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to intact cerebral artery, cultured cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells have lipoxygenase activity, the major product of which is 15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a possible role of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24644">HPETEs</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
