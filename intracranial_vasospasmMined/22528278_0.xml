<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: For the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, current therapies have focused on increasing blood flow through blood pressure augmentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo>, the use of intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, and angioplasty of proximal cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a large case series, we present our experience of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with a protocol based on maintenance of homeostasis (correction of electrolyte and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disturbances, prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, replacement of fluid losses), and the use of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> to improve microcirculation (the Montreal Neurological Hospital protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to describe the use <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> in our practice and the neurological outcomes associated with this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Large case series based on the review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with delayed ischemic neurologic deficits after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> between April 1999 and April 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 88 patients were followed for a mean time of 44.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> infusion was used for a mean of 9.8 days without any significant side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No medical complications associated with this protocol were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; of the surviving patients, 48.9 % were able to go back to their previous baseline and 75 % had a good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale â‰¤ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A protocol using intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi>, and the maintenance of homeostasis is simple to use and requires less intensive monitoring and resources than the standard triple H therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the obvious limitations of this study's design, we believe that it would be now appropriate to proceed with formal prospective studies of this protocol </plain></SENT>
