<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most studies examined either the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) or the vasodilative pathway of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and did not include investigations regarding the relationship between vasospasm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), decreases the concentration of NO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF concentrations of ADMA and ET-1 were retrospectively determined in 30 patients after SAH and in controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DCI was monitored by follow-up CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>17 patients developed arteriographic CVS and 4 patients developed DCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ADMA but not ET-1 concentrations were correlated with occurrence and degree of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, ET-1 concentrations were correlated with WFNS grade on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither ADMA nor ET-1 correlated with DCI in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ET-1 concentrations seem to be associated with the impact of the SAH bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ADMA may be directly involved in the development and resolution of CVS after SAH via inhibition of NOS disturbing the balance of vasodilative and -constrictive components </plain></SENT>
