<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mesothelial cell integrity of the subdural and arachnoid surfaces in the cat was investigated by scanning electron microscopy after exposure to different irrigation fluids used in neurosurgery, as well as after drying by air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irrigation for 3 hours with Elliott's Solution B and Ringer's solution retained the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After exposure to saline for the same time, the mesothelial cells appeared perforated and were sometimes detached from the underlying connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure to air for 15 minutes induced extensive, probably irreversible, cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 minutes of exposure to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, most cells disappeared, revealing the underlying collagenous connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mesothelial cell changes might be one cause of the formation of postoperative subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, disturbance of the blood-brain barrier was produced by those agents causing mesothelial cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, widespread <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in leptomeningeal vessels supplying the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in these vessels can obviously be induced easily by fluids applied to the subdural space because of the close contact between the arachnoid and the adventitia of the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This alternative should be considered in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
