<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid from patients on day 2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> induced transient elevation in cytosolic-free calcium levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the maximal elevation of cytosolic-free calcium levels induced by cerebrospinal fluid from control patients (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>) was significantly lower than that induced by cerebrospinal fluid from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cultured porcine cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> promoted levels of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation (DNA synthesis) more than 2.5-fold higher than that promoted by cerebrospinal fluid from control patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, there was no significant difference in [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation between cerebrospinal fluid from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and that by control cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results in cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells, cerebrospinal fluid from patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> may play not only constrictive functions, evidenced by cytosolic-free calcium elevations, but also proliferative functions, demonstrated by promotion of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these factors to vasospasm will be discussed </plain></SENT>
