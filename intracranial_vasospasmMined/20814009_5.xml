<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) still has a high risk for poor outcome that is frequently attributable to symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that cellular microparticles (MP) play a role in the pathogenesis of CVS and may serve as biomarkers for CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 20 consecutive SAH patients, endothelial, leukocyte, platelet, and erythrocyte MP were measured during 15 days after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVS was detected by transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty matched volunteers served as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte MP were elevated in SAH patients compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD105(+) and CD62e(+) endothelial MP were significantly higher in SAH patients with Doppler sonographic CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD105(+) endothelial MP were especially increased on the days of Doppler sonographic CVS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients experiencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> attributable to vasospasm, CD41(+) platelet MP were elevated in addition to endothelial MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD41(+) platelet MP were significantly higher in patients with any level of disability (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¥1) compared to those who made a full recovery (modified Rankin Scale score=0) on discharge from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial MP were elevated in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This elevation coincided with the occurrence of Doppler sonographic CVS and therefore could be a novel biomarker for CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelet MP might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> attributable to vasospasm, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
