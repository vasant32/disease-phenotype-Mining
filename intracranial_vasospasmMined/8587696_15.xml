<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin (ET) receptors are composed of the <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors and the ETB receptors; ET1 acts on both of these receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it has been previously thought that the <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor mediates vasoconstriction, whereas the ETB receptor mediates vasodilation, recent evidence suggests that ETB receptor also contributes to vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
