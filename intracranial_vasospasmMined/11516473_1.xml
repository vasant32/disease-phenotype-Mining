<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains a major complication in patients suffering from SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, we reported that stimulating vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel activity prevented the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46936">nonivamide</z:chebi> (GLNVA), a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> derivative, has a vasorelaxant effect on the aortic vascular smooth muscle due to the release of coronary calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, which in turn stimulates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine the preventive effects of GLNVA on vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to experimental SAH by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLNVA or vehicle was injected intrathecally immediately after the induction of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed by perfusion-fixation at 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and their cross-sectional areas were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average cross-sectional areas of basilar arteries were reduced by 69% and 71% in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups, respectively, when compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment with 0.35, 1.75, and 3.5 mg/kg GLNVA in rabbits subjected to SAH the average cross-sectional area was decreased by 46%, 12% and 2%, respectively, when compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of GLNVA achieved statistical significance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina of vessels was often observed in the vehicle-treated group, but was not prominent in the GLNVA-treated groups or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings showed that GLNVA dose-dependently attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intrathecal administration of GLNVA could be an effective strategy for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
