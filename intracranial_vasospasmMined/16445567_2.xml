<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study addresses the role of 5-lipoxygenase and its products, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23511,32460">cysteinyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> (CysLTs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> (LT) B4, in the contraction induced by AVP in rat basilar artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contractions to AVP were determined in the absence or presence of 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> or CysLT1 or BLT receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> and AVP are expressed as a percentage of the contraction induced by 80 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A concentration-response curve was constructed for AVP over the range 1 pmol/L to 10 nmol/L and an EC50 value of 0.19 +/- 0.02 nmol/L (n = 30) was determined </plain></SENT>
