<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had magnetic resonance imaging before undergoing first control DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had calcium-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (Nimodipine) via a central venous catheter, were kept on the neurosurgical intensive care unit and followed daily with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient (6.3%) developed moderate and 5 (31.1%) developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> as documented with TCD and exhibited deterioration of their level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 6 patients were treated with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypervolaemia</z:e> and haemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their blood flow velocities were elevated for a mean of 8 (5-17) days with a peak after 12.5 (9-17) days following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No complications due to treatment were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient of the non-vasospastic group died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, another patient had an ischaemic incident during angiography, which has led to permanent disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow-up 2-24 months after SAH 14 patients had returned to their premorbid state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that patients suffering from SAH of unknown origin should undergo repeated angiographic investigation and subsequent daily monitoring of their neurologic status including daily TCD recordings so that haemodynamic treatment can be established in the event of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, which may occur in up to one third of these patients </plain></SENT>
