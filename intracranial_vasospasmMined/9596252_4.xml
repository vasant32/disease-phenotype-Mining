<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) frequently demonstrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the participation of aPLs in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH, we studied the relationships of aPLs and SAH in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SAH was produced in 34 rabbits that received two subarachnoid injections of autologous arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into four experimental groups: SAH was induced in group A (n=9), intracutaneous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) was performed before the induction of SAH in group B (n=5), intravenous injection of CL was performed before SAH in group C (n=12), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> was infused intravenously after the intravenous injection of CL and induction of SAH in group D (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay identifying the titer of IgG CL antibodies, neurological evaluation, cerebral angiography, and histological examination were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant elevation of anti-CL antibodies, aggravation of neurological deficit, and reduction of caliber of the basilar artery were observed in rabbits that received the intravenous immunization of CL (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> reduced the titer of anti-CL antibody, aggravation of neurological deficit, constriction of basilar artery, and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CL antibodies may therefore be involved in the deterioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
