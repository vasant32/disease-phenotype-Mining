<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been longstanding controversy over the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> infusion in the medical management of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several clinical trials evaluating the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and their poor outcome have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, results from the majority of these studies have been inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on patient outcomes after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane library were searched for controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> infusion after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight studies consisting of 936 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a decreased risk of poor outcome at 3-6 months after SAH in <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> treatment groups when compared to placebo [0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.93)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was defined as severe disability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as measured by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE) or modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of mortality after SAH was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> treatment [RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-1.27)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">Magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> infusion decreases risk of poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Current studies in the literature do not suggest a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> in mortality reduction after SAH </plain></SENT>
