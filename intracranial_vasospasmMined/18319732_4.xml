<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this prospective clinical study, 77 aSAH patients provided genetic material and were followed for the occurrence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, genotype was the only factor predictive of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for symptomatic vasospasm in patients with one T allele was 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 to 10.0, P=0.034) and 10.9 for TT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with angiographic spasm were 3.6 times more likely to have a T allele (95% CI: 1.3 to 9.6, P=0.013; for TT: OR 12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe vasospasm requiring endovascular therapy were more likely to have a T allele (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.3 to 9.5, P=0.016; for TT: OR 12.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with the T allele of the eNOS gene are more likely to have severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of this genotype may allow the identification of individuals at high risk for post-aSAH vasospasm and lead to early treatment and improved outcome </plain></SENT>
