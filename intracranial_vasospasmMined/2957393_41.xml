<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After cisternal injection of autologous blood we documented spasm of the basilar artery upon angiography from 4 to 7 d postictus in six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When these basilar arteries were isolated we observed marked membrane depolarization and enhanced electrical spike activity compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slope of the membrane potential vs log [K]0 curve was significantly reduced in arteries exposed to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis supported the concept that such altered muscle cell properties resulted from reduction in resting K+ conductance (gk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure of arteries in vitro to nicorandil (10(-9)-10(-7)M) (a drug which acts by increasing gk) hyperpolarized the muscle cells and increased internal diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infusion of nicorandil (3-5 micrograms/kg per min) to intact, anesthetized animals reversed, by 50%, the reduction in basilar artery diameter after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
