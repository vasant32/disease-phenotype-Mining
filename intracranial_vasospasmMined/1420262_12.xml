<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cocaine.HCl (1-5 mg/kg) administered systemically to lightly anesthetized rats resulted in significant and progressive deficits in whole brain intracellular free Mg ([Mg2+]i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracellular pH (pHi) also fell in a progressive manner but only after a significant fall in brain [Mg2+]i was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both [Mg2+]i and pHi returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains of rats that exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like events, however, demonstrated continued intracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> associated with progressive loss of phosphocreatine and elevation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> up until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations are consistent with the tenet that injection of cocaine can result in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and rupture of cerebral blood vessels as a consequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of brain [Mg2+]i </plain></SENT>
