<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the capability of donors of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi>) to reverse endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced cerebral vasoconstriction in vivo, when administered through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the adventitial side of the constricted blood vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rabbit basilar artery was exposed through a transcervical, transclival approach and subsequently subjected to pharmacological manipulations and direct observation of effects by videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific manipulations were suffusion of ET-1 (100 nmol/L, 1 ml/min) in synthetic CSF (sCSF) to provoke vasoconstriction and then either suffusion of an NO donor in sCSF (2 mg/ml/min), or sCSF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second suffusion was always made separately and begun during the period of stable maximal vasoconstriction, which occurred between 20 and 30 minutes after beginning the first suffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the diameter of the artery were made using an inline video caliper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">Sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi>, both donors of NO, rapidly and completely reversed ET-1-induced vasoconstriction without causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average value for maximal vasoconstriction by ET-1/sCSF was 50.4% of baseline arterial diameter and occurred between 20 and 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of vasodilatory response was 100% of significantly constricted arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response was complete in less than 6 minutes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparations, as compared to the 60 minutes required for spontaneous relaxation (sCSF suffusion alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NO donors are effective in reversing cerebral vasoconstriction when administered intrathecally, cause no significant hemodynamic change when so administered, and may represent an important therapeutic intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
