<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As systemic administration of vasoactive drugs has been associated with significant side effects and insufficient efficacy, intrathecal administration of nicardipine prolonged-release implants (NPRI) has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of surgical clipping of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, NPRIs are positioned next to the large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several clinical protocols revealed that NPRIs dramatically reduce the incidence and severity of angiographic vasospasm, which was paralled by a reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and delayed ischemic neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average, the incidence of angiographic vasospasm decreased from approximately 70% to less than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy seemed to be dose-dependent and reduced for peripheral vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a significant improvement of functional outcome was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A separate patient series demonstrated the efficacy of fewer NPRIs in the perichiasmatic cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations were performed in comparison to coiled patients and with intraventricular implantation of NPRIs, which had a less pronounced effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, NPRIs are a most promising option for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH and large controlled trials are needed to further confirm these results </plain></SENT>
