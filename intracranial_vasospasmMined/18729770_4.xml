<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the recently reported early brain injury after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> SAH modeling was obtained by injecting 0.5 mL/kg of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of five adult mongrel dogs on day 0 and day 2, followed by imaging at day 2 and day 7 using a 4.7-Tesla (T) scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter (WM) showed a remarkable increase in T2 values at day 2 which resolved by day 7, whereas gray matter (GM) T2 values did not resolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values progressively increased in both WM and GM after SAH, suggestive of a transition from vasogenic to cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular volume also increased dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prominent neuronal injury with Nissl's staining was seen in the cortical GM and in the periventricular tissue </plain></SENT>
