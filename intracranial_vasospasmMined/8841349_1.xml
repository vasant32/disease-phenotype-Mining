<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of acceleration was significantly related to the clinical grade of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence exists for an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> for protein kinase C (PKC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to help clarify whether PKC has a role in contraction of the ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the effects of a myristoylated PKC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor (Myr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32668">-Gln</z:chebi>-Lys<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi>-Val) (PKC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor), (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077) (inhibitor of protein kinase A, myosin light-chain kinase, and protein kinase G), 7-deacetyl-6-(N-ace-tylglycyl)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>) (adenyl cyclase activator), and diacylglycerol-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> (DAG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi>) (PKC activator) on fibroblast-populated collagen lattice compaction with or without CSF from SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four sets of fibroblasts were used: three explanted from skin and one from cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate and high concentrations of PKC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor inhibited lattice compaction with or without acceleration by CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low concentration of PKC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibitor enhanced acceleration by CSF but had no effects without CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HA-1077 could not inhibit lattice compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> inhibited compaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DAG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> accelerated compaction in early phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the mechanism of acceleration of contraction of ECM under the influence of CSF, PKC seems to have two different roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase A and myosin light-chain kinase apparently play more minor roles than PKC in the mechanism, but no evidence was found of a role for protein kinase G activation in matrix compaction </plain></SENT>
