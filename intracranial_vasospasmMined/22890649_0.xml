<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with nonaneurysmal -<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) show either perimesencephal (pm)SAH or nonperimesencephalic (non-pm)SAH, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> extending into adjacent cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with non-pmSAH have higher risk for a complicated clinical course with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) and worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> has been linked to CVS occurrence and worse outcome in aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed whether levels of interleukin (IL)-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, differ in patients with pmSAH compared with non-pmSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical course with attention to symptomatic CVS occurrence and clinical outcome was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daily systemic IL-6 levels and leukocyte counts (Lc) were measured in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase in 11 patients with pmSAH and in 9 patients with non-pmSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with non-pmSAH had significantly higher IL-6 levels compared to patients with pmSAH (14.7 ± 3.2 vs. 3.0 �� 0.6 pg/ml, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lc counts did not differ (11.5 ± 0.5 vs. 11.2 ± 0.6 × 10(3)/μl, p = 0.485) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with non-pmSAH stayed significantly longer in the neurocritical care unit (16.4 ± 2.1 vs. 10.2 ± 1.1 days, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic CVS occurred in two patients with non-pmSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with pmSAH had a significantly more favorable outcome, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher IL-6 levels in patients with non-pmSAH supports the common observation of more complicated illness course with higher incidence of CVS compared to patients with pmSAH </plain></SENT>
