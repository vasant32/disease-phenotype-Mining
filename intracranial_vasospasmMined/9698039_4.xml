<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the prophylactic effect of a novel nonpeptide endothelin (ET) A-receptor selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, S-0139, using a canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model and an ET-1-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The agent markedly prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model when given intracisternally or intravenously by continuous daily dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An efficacious intravenous method was to apply a relatively high initial dose followed by daily sustaining administration at a much lower dose, which alone would have been ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The need for sustaining dosing may imply daily successive attacks of ETs in the cerebral vessel compartment after the introduction of autologous blood into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A small amount of S-0139 was detected from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an apparent lag time after its disappearance from the plasma following intravenous dosing of 0.83 mg/kg/min for 12 min, however, cerebral vasoconstriction induced by ET-1 dosing from the adventitial side was clearly inhibited during such a lag period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its movement into the CSF was greatly enhanced after the application of autologous blood to the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that ET-1 play a major role in producing delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, and S-0139 effectively antagonizes the action of ET-1 even by intravenous treatment because it moves easily into the cerebral vessel compartment from plasma </plain></SENT>
