<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It usually occurs about 3-9 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis involves the release of endogenous spasmogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though various treatment modalities are available, none are really effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to develop an effective animal model for the study of SAH and vasospasm as well as to study the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, namely <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> and papaverine, on SAH-induced vasospasm using magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen Wistar <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats, weighing around 150-200 gm were used for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five rats served as controls of SAH-induced vasospasm, while five rats each were used to study the efficacy of intracisternal injection of papaverine or <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats demonstrate vasospasm in a manner similar to humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximal vasospasm is seen in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrates an improvement in vasospasm after instillation of intracisternal papaverine at the end of 2 hours in basilar and left internal cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> does not produce any significant amelioration of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, it can be deduced that the pathogenesis of the vasospasm is more due to the action of cGMPase enzyme rather than inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthetase by the spasmogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first study in the English literature to compare the effects of single bolus doses of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> and papaverine using magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rats can be used to create an effective model for SAH-induced vasospasm as the pattern resembles human SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Papaverine is an effective drug for ameliorating SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Short-acting NO donors are not as effective in ameliorating vasospasm </plain></SENT>
