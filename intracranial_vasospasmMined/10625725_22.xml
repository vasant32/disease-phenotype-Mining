<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>Hyponatremia</z:hpo> has been shown in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past few years there has been increasing evidence that brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) is responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between BNP plasma concentrations and CVS after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BNP plasma concentrations were assessed at 4 different time periods (1 to 3 days, 4 to 6 days, 7 to 9 days, and 10 to 12 days) in 19 patients with spontaneous SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BNP plasma levels were investigated with respect to neurological condition, SAH severity on CT, and flow velocities measured by means of transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients had Doppler evidence of CVS; 7 of these had nonsymptomatic CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, CVS was severe and symptomatic, with delayed ischemic lesion on CT in 5 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CVS was severe and symptomatic in 6 patients, and delayed ischemic lesions were revealed on CT in 5 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BNP levels were found to be significantly elevated in SAH patients compared with control subjects (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in patients without CVS or with nonsymptomatic CVS, BNP concentrations decreased throughout the 4 time periods, whereas a 6-fold increase was observed in patients with severe symptomatic CVS between the first and the third periods (P=0.0096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar trend in BNP plasma levels was found in patients with severe SAH compared with those with nonvisible or moderate SAH (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results show that BNP plasma levels are elevated shortly after SAH, although they increase markedly during the first week in patients with symptomatic CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that secretion of BNP secretion after spontaneous SAH may exacerbate blood flow reduction due to arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
