<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present studies show that nimodipine prevents and/or improves permanent ischemic neurological deficits in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was particularly marked in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in which statistically significant reductions in mortality and morbidity as consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow, to reduce vasoconstriction, although not to fully prevent angiographic vasospasm, and to improve central conduction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine did not increase the rate of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its administration during anesthesia does not result in management problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, nimodipine was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Side effects were recorded mainly in open studies using the intravenous formulation and consisted mainly of decreases in blood pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient increases in liver enzymes may be due to the organic solvent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> results indicate that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> will benefit from preventive or therapeutic nimodipine treatment </plain></SENT>
