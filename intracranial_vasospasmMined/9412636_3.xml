<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Systemic hypertension</z:hpo> also causes vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both of these histological changes can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the cerebrovascular system, reducing its autoregulatory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery at rest and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) (percent rise in BFV after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stimulation) measured by means of transcranial Doppler sonography were studied many years after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in patients with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (mean BFV &gt; 160 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BFV under resting conditions and the CVRC values of the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres were measured in 29 patients (mean age, 43 years; mean follow-up, 4.6 years) and compared with those of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persistent high BFV (&gt; 120 cm/s) was found in three patients in the peripheral branch of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the main trunks of the arteries of the anterior circle of Willis, BFV was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CVRC was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (ipsilateral, 52 +/- 21%; contralateral, 56 +/- 17%); values did not differ significantly from each other or from the control value (45 +/- 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The higher value of CVRC on the contralateral side was found to be statistically significant in selected groups (hypertensive patients and patients with residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on late CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative vasculopathy developed at the time of vasospasm must have resolved and did not reduce late vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> also did not seem to influence the late vasoreactivity toward normalization </plain></SENT>
