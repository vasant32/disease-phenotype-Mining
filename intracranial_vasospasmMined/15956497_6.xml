<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has been a serious clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of selective intraarterial (IA) nimodipine treatment in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two adult New-Zealand rabbits of either sex, weighing 2500-3800 g were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a control angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals received 1 mL of fresh unheparinized autologuous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days later, the presence of vasospasm was demonstrated angiographically by selective vertebral artery injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental design was as follows: separate groups of animals (n = 5, in each group) received nimodipine (0.05 mg/kg), papaverine (6 mg/kg), or vehicle intraarterially, after placement of a microcatheter into the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another group (n = 5) received nimodipine (0.05 mg/kg) directly into the cisterna magna, and vehicle injection was made into cisterna magna in two other animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after treatment, angiographies were repeated and changes in arterial diameter were expressed as percentages of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IA nimodipine and IA papaverine were effective in relieving veretebral and basilary vasospasm (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IA nimodipine was more effective than IA papaverine (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IA nimodipine was not more effective than intrathecal (IT) nimodipine in relieving vertebral artery vasospasm, although it was more effective than IT nimodipine in basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vehicle injections (IA or IT) failed to reverse the vasospasm induced by autologuous blood injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that selective IA nimodipine treatment may be considered as an alternative in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasospasm following SAH </plain></SENT>
