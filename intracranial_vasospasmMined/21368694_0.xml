<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (VSP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current endovascular paradigm for VSP refractory to medical therapy is to perform angioplasty for proximal vessel VSP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> infusion for distal vessel VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with a large series of balloon angioplasty for distal VSP refractory to medical therapy in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective series of 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and symptomatic VSP refractory to medical therapy who were treated with balloon angioplasty for distal vessel VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate angiographic results, procedure-related complications, and clinical outcomes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From September 2001 to January 2010, 32 patients with symptomatic VSP refractory to medical therapy underwent angioplasty for distal arterial VSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 26 women (81.3%); patients were 29 to 67 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 175 vessels were angioplastied (95 proximal and 80 distal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only complication was rupture of an incompletely clipped <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that was treated by immediate coiling and did not result in any clinical worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatment was needed for 6 arteries (6 of 80, 7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related symptomatic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¤ 2) were observed in 23 of 28 patients (82.1%) with follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon angioplasty for distal VSP is safe and effective and decreases the need for repeated intraarterial treatments seen with infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
