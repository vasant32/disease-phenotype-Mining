<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine has previously been used to treat vasospasm through superselective intracranial microcatheter injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a simple method of treatment of vasospasm with slow infusion of nicardipine from a cervical catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with symptomatic vasospasm were treated over 4 years with cervical catheter infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine was infused at 20 mg/h for 30 to 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was used in severe cases at the operator's discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome at discharge and follow-up was evaluated with Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (17 women, 12 men) received intra-arterial therapy for vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm treatment was done at a mean post-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> date of 7.2 days (range, 4-15 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They underwent 48 sessions of treatment (mean, 1.8 per patient) in 72 separate arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients underwent multiple treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean dose used per session was 19.2 mg (range, 5-50 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent angioplasty for severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (81.5%) had clinical improvement after the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Angiographic improvement was seen in 86.1% of the vessels analyzed, which had moderate or severe spasm before infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall, 17 patients (62.9%) had good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 4 and 5) at discharge, 11 had poor outcome, and 1 patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available in 19 patients, and 18 were doing well (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 4 and 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial nicardipine is an effective and safe treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In most patients, infusion can be performed from the cervical catheter, with microcatheter infusion and angioplasty reserved for the more severe and resistant cases </plain></SENT>
