<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to critically analyze the effectiveness of two tools used by nurses to assess neurological status of individuals at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early detection of vasospasm provides an opportunity for prompt treatment so that further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or infarction can be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale would detect symptomatic vasospasm earlier than the standard neurological record currently used in the practice setting of a tertiary care teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty participants were entered into the study, and a differential diagnostic process identified 15 with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative prospective and retrospective analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between the two scales in early detection of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding may partially be explained by the clinical similarities between the vasospasm and nonvasospasm groups and by the challenges experienced by nurses in administering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant observations suggested the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale was more effective in the assessment of focal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Qualitative content analysis of nursing notes also provided insight into clinical findings not captured on either scale regarding generalized changes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, impulsiveness, and unusual behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the need to develop a more appropriate tool for early detection of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
