<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nicardipine prolonged release implants (NPRI) have been shown to decrease the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> significantly in patients after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) following microsurgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the comparison with results after endovascular coiling is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the differences in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and infarctions between those two treatment modalities METHODS: The design of this investigation reflects a case-control study; 27 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH were treated by microsurgical clipping and received an intracisternal implantation of NPRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven matching consecutive patients after microsurgical treatment without implantation of NPRI or endovascular treatment, respectively, served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of angiographic vasospasm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were comparable concerning demographics and severity of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of 81 patients developed angiographic vasospasm (&gt;33% constriction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of vasospasm was 48%, 44% and 11% for patients after endovascular treatment, microsurgical clipping without NPRI and microsurgical clipping with NPRI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> occurred in 28%, 22% and 7% of the treated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A good clinical recovery 1 year after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (modified Rankin scale 0-2) was seen in 48%, 50% and 77% of the treated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of NPRI during microsurgical clipping was confirmed to be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who received intracisternally implanted NPRI during clipping after aneurysmal SAH yielded significantly lower vasospasm and infarction rates, and showed a better clinical outcome when compared with clipping without NPRI and also when compared with endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
