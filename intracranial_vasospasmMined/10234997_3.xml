<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesioning of the A2-nucleus, its ascending cathecolamine pathways or their projection site, the median eminence in the hypothalamus, prevents the occurrence of spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unilateral postganglionic trigeminal lesion causes an ipsilateral constriction of the cerebral arteries while a preganglionic lesion does not affect the baseline arterial diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both kinds of trigeminal lesions induce a global increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake of about 50% without influencing CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) the decrease in CBF in both groups of lesioned animals is similar to that seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After SAH there is no further change in CMRglu in the animals with a preganglionic lesion, while in the postganglionically lesioned animals there is an additional increase in CMRglu of about 50% as compared to controls or animals with a preganglionic lesion </plain></SENT>
