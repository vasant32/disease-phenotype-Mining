<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have shown that early treatment with NO prevents vasospasm in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of controlled-release polymers that contain the NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">diethylenetriamine</z:chebi> (DETA-NO) for the delayed treatment of vasospasm in a rabbit model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DETA-NO 20% (wt/wt) was incorporated into <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="46916">vinyl acetate</z:chebi> (EVAc) polymers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals (n = 52) were randomized to two experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first group (n = 32), animals received SAH and implantation of either 20% DETA-NO/EVAc polymer at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of DETA-NO (n = 16) or empty EVAc polymer (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymers were implanted 24 (n = 16) or 48 hours (n = 16) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second group (n = 20), animals received SAH and implantation of either 20% DETA-NO/EVAc polymer at a dose of 1.3 mg/kg (n = 10) or empty EVAc (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polymers were implanted 24 (n = 10) or 48 hours (n = 10) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An additional group (n = 16) underwent either sham operation (n = 6) or SAH only (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 3 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and the basilar arteries were processed for morphometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed using Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with 20% DETA-NO/EVAc polymers at a dose of 1.3 mg/kg significantly increased basilar artery lumen patency when administered at 24 (97 +/- 6% versus 73 +/- 10%; P = 0.0396) or 48 hours (94 +/- 6% versus 71 +/- 9%; P = 0.03) after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 20% DETA-NO/EVAc polymers at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered 48 hours after SAH significantly increased lumen patency (82 +/- 8% versus 68 +/- 12%; P = 0.03); a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 24 hours after SAH, did not reach statistical significance (74 +/- 7% versus 65 +/- 9%; P = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The SAH-only group had a lumen patency of 67 +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed treatment of SAH with controlled-release DETA-NO polymers prevented experimental posthemorrhagic vasospasm in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This further confirms the role of NO in the pathogenesis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
