<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> is a potent cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> we have introduced routine supplementation in patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> to determine whether there has been a reduction in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> from February 1997 were included except those who presented after day 5 following bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identical management protocol was used except intravenous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation which was introduced to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from May 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> on angiograms among the two groups was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Seven out of 10 patients who did not receive <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplement developed vasospasm requiring intra-arterial papaverine compared with 2 of 13 patients among the treated group (P&lt;0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: From our pilot study it appears that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplement has a beneficial role in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
