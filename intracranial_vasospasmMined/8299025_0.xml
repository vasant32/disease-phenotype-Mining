<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It always leads to grave neurological deficit and sometimes causes mortality of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many neurosurgeons consider it as a result of the presence of subarachnoid blood clot and try to prevent it by evacuating the blood clot immediately after clipping of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> during operation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nonmechanical method of clearing blood clot by intrathecal injection of thrombolytic agents has been used in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is one of these new drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two dogs were divided into 4 groups in this study: control group (n = 6), vehicle group (n = 6), 50 micrograms/kg t-PA treated group (n = 5) and 100 micrograms/kg t-PA treated group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These dogs were prepared as "double <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> canine model." Vehicle solution or different dosages of t-PA were given twice into the foramen magnum through an anchored catheter after artificial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the ratio of diameter of basilar artery measured after treatment to that measured before treatment in each groups were 75 +/- 8%, 72 +/- 4%, 86 +/- 4%, and 87 +/- 4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences between control group and either 50 micrograms/kg t-PA treated group or 100 micrograms/kg t-PA treated groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that effective prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can be achieved safely by administration of t-PA as low as 50 micrograms/kg for two divided doses to dissolve the subarachnoid blood clot in canine model </plain></SENT>
