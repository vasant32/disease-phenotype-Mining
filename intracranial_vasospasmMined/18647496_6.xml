<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Worldwide effort has led to many promising experimental treatments but none was confirmed to be effective in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ecdysterone is an insect steroid hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our previous study showed that ecdysterone might prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these works, rare attempts have been made to test the effect of ecdysterone on vascular adventitial fibroblast (VAF) proliferation, a process known to play an important role in various pathogenic vascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested the hypothesis that ecdysterone could affect VAF characteristics and have an effect on SAH induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OxyHb of 100 microM was used in the in vitro study to mimic the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of OxyHb on the cell proliferation and migration of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, 20 rabbits were equally divided into four groups: control group, SAH group, SAH/nimodipine group and SAH/ecdysterone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in neurological function and cerebral angiograms were observed after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OxyHb increased the proliferation of vascular adventitial fibroblasts at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ecdysterone co-treatment was apparently similar to the suppression of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis indicated that ecdysterone inhibited the progression of vascular adventitial fibroblasts from G1 to S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of the migration assay showed that 100 microM OxyHb obviously prompted vascular adventitial fibroblast migration and that ecdysterone would attenuate this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the SAH/nimodipine and SAH/ecdysterone groups, neurological deficit, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and structural changes in basilar artery were alleviated with nimodipine or ecdysterone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ecdysterone could affect vascular adventitial fibroblast characteristics and attenuate vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
