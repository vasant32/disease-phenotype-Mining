<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty healthy mongrel dogs were randomly divided into five groups; artificial cerebrospinal fluid group (group A), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> temperature control group (group C), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> 8 h group (group H1), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> 16 h group (group H2), and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> 32 h group (group H3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors injected the artificial CSF into dog's foramen magnum in group A while the other four groups were injected with autologous arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group's temperature maintained 38.5°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors set the temperature at 33.5°C in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> groups and this was maintained for 8, 16, and 32 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ET-1 and NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were assayed in each group on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the changes of the diameter of blood vessels of cerebral basilar artery and overall performance categories score in each group through application of CT angiography were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> model which was constructed by injecting the blood to dog twice, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment, through the application of vascular heat-exchange controller, could reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the duration of the mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is directly proportional to the longer duration of the relieving of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal changes observed in the levels of ET-1 and NO in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma revealed that it might be possible to reduce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by regulating the rising amplitude of ET-1 and the decrease in NO in CSF and plasma </plain></SENT>
