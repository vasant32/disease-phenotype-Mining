<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, adiponectin has been demonstrated to play a neuroprotective role against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the time-course serial expression changes of adiponectin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and the effects of adiponectin on cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of adiponectin were measured serially until day 14 in CSF of 8 patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF samples obtained from 6 patients suffering from an unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected from 6 healthy adult volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rat cerebral arteries were incubated with adiponectin (2μg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis using <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), phosphorylated (p)-AMPKα at Thr(172), endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), p-eNOS at Ser(1177) and actin antibodies was then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adiponectin concentrations in serum and control CSF were 17,670±3748ng/ml and 9.2±3.0ng/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After SAH, the concentration of adiponectin in the CSF significantly increased on the first post-SAH day and gradually decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin significantly phosphorylated both the AMPKα and eNOS of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that adiponectin is significantly increased in the CSF after SAH, resulting in the activation of AMPKα and eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin plays an important role against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> via the AMPK/eNOS signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
