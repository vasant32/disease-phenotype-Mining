<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of hypervolemic preload enhancement on cardiac performance was systematically analyzed in nine patients following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 34 to 63 years, and none had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent placement of a flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter and the following measurements were taken during hypervolemic therapy: pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index (SVI), and left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work index (LVSWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After baseline measurements were recorded, hetastarch or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52567">plasmanate</z:chebi> was infused intravenously at 300 cc/hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thermal output determination and pressures were measured every 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PAWP did not correlate in a statistically significant fashion with the CVP in the ranges recorded; however, a statistically significant correlation did exist between PAWP increases and increases in CI, SVI, and LVSWI (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical correlation between PAWP increases above 14 mm Hg and improvement in cardiac performance as evidenced by CI, SVI, and LVSWI measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CVP is an unreliable index of cardiac performance during hypervolemic therapy and that, in previously healthy individuals, a PAWP of 14 mm Hg is associated with maximum cardiac performance </plain></SENT>
