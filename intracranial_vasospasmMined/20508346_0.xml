<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are less common, accounting for 3.1 to 9.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>.The clinical characteristics and surgical techniques are quite different from those of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of Willis circle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiographic characteristics of ruptured distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and the efficacy of endovascular treatment for these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1998 to 2008, 41 patients with 44 DACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by endovascular coiling, including parent vessel occlusion using coils or coils combined with n-butyle-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in two, endosaccular coiling alone in 39, and stent-assisted coiling in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 40 (97.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> successfully treated with endosaccular coiling or stent-assisted coiling, complete occlusion was obtained in 37, neck remnant in two, and partial occlusion in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with poor pretreatment conditions died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morbidity was 4.87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case each of unruptured recurrence and rebleeding were seen in follow-up DSA of 34 patients and MRA in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results show that endovascular treatment for DACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the relative high recurrent rate highlights long-term follow-up for its security </plain></SENT>
