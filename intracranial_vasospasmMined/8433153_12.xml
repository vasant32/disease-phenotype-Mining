<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography on Day 7 showed that the diameters of the ICA, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and ACA were reduced to 55.7% +/- 1.3%, 55.3% +/- 2.6%, and 59.6% +/- 1.3%, respectively, of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angioplasty was carried out with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> microballoon attached to a microcatheter under somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) monitoring on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angioplasty for ICA was performed satisfactorily; however, the balloon could not be advanced to the spastic M1 or A1 portions of the cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following angioplasty, the diameters of the ICA, the M1 segment, and the A1 segment were 79.6% +/- 2.9% (p &lt; 0.001), 67.6% +/- 4.3% (p &lt; 0.05), and 61.7% +/- 2.2% (not significant), respectively, of baseline </plain></SENT>
