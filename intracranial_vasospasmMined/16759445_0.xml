<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is suggested that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is not high in the cases where ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> are obliterated using Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) without clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of subarachnoid clot removal on the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and the different incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> between clipping cases and in GDC cases are reviewed.Surgical clot removal in experimental model indicated marked preventive effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical trials of clot removal during early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery had failed to show satisfactory preventive effect for vasospasm, and the cumulative incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in these trials was 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As fibrinolytic drug, intrathecal administration of tissue plasminogen activator showed sufficient elimination of subarachnoid clot and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the experimental studies and in the clinical case trials and nonrandomized case-control trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the multi-center, randomized case-control trial showed no statistically significant effect on symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in GDC cases was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The comparative studies of the incidence of vasospasm between GDC cases and in clipping cases also showed less incidence of symptomatic vasospasm and a more favorable outcome in GDC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the results of studies reviewed, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> seems less in GDC cases than in clipping cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be clarified why clipping could not be dominant in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> compared to GDC </plain></SENT>
