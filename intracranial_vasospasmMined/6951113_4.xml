<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may have specific blocking actions, whereas the origin of vasospasm is likely to be multiplex, the effect of nimodipine on the contractions of isolated canine basilar arteries that are produced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, thrombin, and whole blood was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that nimodipine significantly inhibits the contractile responses induced by these diverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> whether it is given before or after the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that, in canine cerebral arteries, a common calcium influx channel is involved in the responses elicited by a variety of receptor mechanisms and afford a rationale for the use of nimodipine in the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that often follows <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
