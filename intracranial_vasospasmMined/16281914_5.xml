<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The cellular events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhages</z:hpo> (SAH) involve a number of members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whereas calcium is thought to play a number of major roles in the pathophysiology of SAH, a number of PKCs function independently of calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently emphasized the potential role of the calcium-binding S100 proteins in a 'double haemorrhage' rat model of SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of S100 proteins are known to interfere directly with PKC, or indirectly with PKC substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether specific S100 proteins and PKCs are co-expressed/co-located in a rat model of SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: SAH-induced vasospasm in rats (by means of a double cisternal injection of autologous blood from a rat femoral artery) distinctly modified the expression levels of calcium-dependent PKC-alpha and PKC-beta and calcium-independent PKC-eta and PKC-zeta in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels of these four PKC isotypes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study reveals that, in endothelial cells, the S100B expression/location correlate well with those of PKC-eta, and those of S100A1 with PKC-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In smooth-muscle cells S100A2 expression/location correlate with those of PKC-eta, and those of S100B with PKC-zeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present data argue in favour of a joint action of the S100 protein network and the PKC signalling pathway during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
