<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (PRES) is a rare complication of hemodynamic augmentation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-associated vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The roles of hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion in the genesis of PRES remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We admitted a 35-year-old woman with Hunt &amp; Hess grade II SAH secondary to rupture of a right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was surgically clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beginning on hospital day 3, she developed recurrent symptomatic vasospasm of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> despite hemodynamic augmentation to a MAP as high as 130 mmHg and endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On hospital day 7, after 36 h of sustained MAP 120-130 mmHg, her level of arousal progressively declined, culminating in stupor and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI showed widespread, yet markedly asymmetric changes consistent with PRES largely sparing the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the MAP was decreased to 85-100 mmHg, she had no further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 days later she was fully alert with mild left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PRES is a rare complication of hemodynamic augmentation that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of delayed neurological decline in patients with aneurysmal SAH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The markedly asymmetric distribution of PRES lesions with sparing of the territory affected by vasospasm supports the hypothesis that hyperperfusion underlies the pathophysiology of this disorder </plain></SENT>
