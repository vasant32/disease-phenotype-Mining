<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used laser-Doppler flowmetry to study the effects of endothelin-1 on local cortical microvascular perfusion and resistance in 29 pentobarbital-anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of 10-300 pmol endothelin-1 reduced arterial blood pressure and microvascular resistance and increased microvascular perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, intracarotid administration of low doses of endothelin-1 increased microvascular perfusion and reduced microvascular resistance and arterial blood pressure, whereas high doses (greater than or equal to 300 pmol) reduced microvascular perfusion and increased microvascular resistance and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the high dose/low flow response was associated with attenuation of the electrocorticogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low dose/high flow and high dose/low flow responses to endothelin-1 were not altered by blockade of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, systemic metabolic changes (arterial pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration) did not account for the cerebrovascular effects of endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet hyperaggregability also did not appear to be a causative factor in the high dose/low flow response to endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, ex vivo rat platelet aggregation was inhibited by intracarotid administration of 300 pmol endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the cerebral vasculature exhibits extreme sensitivity to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> properties of endothelin-1 at low doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ischemic vasoconstrictor effects observed at high doses implicate endothelin-1 as an important mediator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and/or postischemic hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
