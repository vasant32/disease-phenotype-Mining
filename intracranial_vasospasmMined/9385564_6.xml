<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the clinical part of the study plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) were measured serially for 2 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Big endothelin-1 was the predominant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> present in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF concentrations of big ET-1, ET-1 and ET-3 were significantly higher in older than in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> postoperative concentrations of endothelins in the CSF remained at or were increased above levels measured before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the basal cisterns was predictive of the concentrations of endothelins in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the experimental study the efficacy of the orally active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin-receptor-antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental SAH, using the canine two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight beagle dogs were used in this laboratory experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals each were assigned to the treatment and to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group each dog received two single doses of 30 mg/kg RO 47-0203 orally per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 1.36 +/- 0.17 mm at day 1 to 1.19 +/- 0.23 mm at day 8 in the treatment group while in the control group the vessel diameter decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.19 mm at day 1 to 1.02 +/- 0.22 mm at day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results corresponded to a decrease of vessel diameter of 13.1% +/- 11.2% in the treatment group and a decrease of vessel diameter of 30.7% +/- 12.4% in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of endothelin-1 in CSF significantly increased with time after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results underline the important role of endothelin in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and gives for the first time evidence that prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> can be achieved by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin-receptor-antagonist</z:chebi> RO 47-0203 </plain></SENT>
