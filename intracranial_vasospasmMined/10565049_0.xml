<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis and clinical course of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (TCV) are not yet fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of delayed symptomatic TCV exaggerated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> in spite of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with multiple injury caused by a traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale on admission was 8, and CT scan revealed right temporal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>, thin sub-arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the right sylvian cistern and right temporal bone fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's consciousness level and CT findings improved gradually, but on the 11th day, she suddenly fell into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No apparent change was observed on the CT scan, but her serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level was markedly low (113 mEq/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> induced consciousness disturbance, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> replacement therapy was commenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She showed transient neurological recovery, but on day 13, worsening of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and a new low density area on CT were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasospasms of the right M2 proximal portion were confirmed by cerebral angiogram, so we performed intraarterial papaverine infusion leading to good extension of spastic vessels, but regrettably, there was no neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, subarachnoid blood plays an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, following not only aneurysmal rupture but also head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCV tends to pass subclinically, but secondary water and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> may unexpectedly cause TCV to manifest itself clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We can confirm that with this patient management of electrolyte balance following head injury was the most important strategy to avoid symptomatic TCV </plain></SENT>
