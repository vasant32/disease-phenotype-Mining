<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It remains controversial whether the intra-arterial administration of papaverine (IAP) is effective in reversing vasospasm-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to continuously assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during and after IAP with the use of quantitative, bedside thermal diffusion flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (mean flow velocity &gt;120 cm/s; angiographic vessel constriction &gt;33%; hemispheric cerebral blood flow [CBF] &lt;32 mL/100 g per minute) were prospectively entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before IAP, thermal diffusion microprobes were implanted into the white matter of each affected vascular territory (n=10) for rCBF monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During and after IAP (300 mg papaverine/50 mL saline over 1 hour), mean arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, thermal diffusion rCBF (TD-rCBF), and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) were recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IAP significantly increased TD-rCBF from 7.3+/-1.6 to 37.9+/-6.6 mL/100 g per minute (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), indicating reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This TD-rCBF response was dependent on the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and reduced perfusion within the vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term analysis of TD-rCBF, however, demonstrated that this beneficial effect of IAP on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> was only transient: within 3 hours after treatment, TD-rCBF and CVR returned to baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a lack of correlation between transcranial Doppler sonography and thermal diffusion flowmetry suggested that transcranial Doppler sonography is not suited for CBF-based neuromonitoring after IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAP is not effective in permanently reversing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The need to validate alternative therapeutic strategies that seek to improve cerebral perfusion in vasospasm warrants continued development of CBF-based neuromonitoring strategies </plain></SENT>
