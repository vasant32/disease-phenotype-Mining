<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate how cerebral arteries are affected by activation of the host immune system, foreign body, <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> latex beads were injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space of rabbits, and the caliber changes of the basilar arteries were studied for 7 days by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prolonged arterial narrowing peaking on day 2 was observed after cisternal injection of the beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in peak narrowing correlated with an increase in the number of beads injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course of the change in vessel caliber over 7 days was similar to that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> caused by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also investigated was the preventive effect of the synthetic serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, FUT-175 on the arterial narrowing caused by the cisternal injection of the latex beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of FUT-175 significantly prevented latex beads-induced vasospasm (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible role of a non-specific immune response is discussed, and also the role of the serine protease cascades in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
