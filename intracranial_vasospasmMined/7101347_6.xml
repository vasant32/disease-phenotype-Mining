<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spasm/narrowing was observed by angiography one hour after SAH in 8 out of 10 monkeys and in 5 of these 8, spasm was observed both one and two weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No narrowing of the vessels was observed in the control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In monkeys that showed spasm one week after SAH, narrowing of the extracranial vertebral arteries was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated injections of blood at intervals of one and two weeks caused intensification of spasm in the intracranial portion of vertebral arteries and the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH may in part be mediated by a central control mechanism acting through the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in that extracranial vessels remote from direct contact with blood showed reactive narrowing </plain></SENT>
