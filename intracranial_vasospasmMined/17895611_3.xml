<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine prolonged-release implants (NPRIs) have been used to prevent vasospasm in patients with SAH since October 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study analyzed the efficacy and safety of NPRIs in 100 patients with SAH and thick subarachnoid clot (mainly Fisher group 3) treated with NPRIs (diameter 2 mm, length 10 mm, containing 4 mg of nicardipine) during surgery after clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number and location of pellets depended on the amount and site of the subarachnoid clot on preoperative computed tomography and on the type of craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two to 12 pellets were implanted in the cisterns of the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and/or anterior cerebral artery, where thick clots were present and vasospasm related to delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) was highly likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only seven patients developed DIND and five patients suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography performed on days 7-12 revealed no vasospasm in any of the arteries close to the site of NPRI placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NPRI placement can completely prevent vasospasm in arteries within the cisterns containing thick clots, but is less effective in remote locations </plain></SENT>
