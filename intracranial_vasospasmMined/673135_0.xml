<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to study the role of sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and vasoactive <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e>, the following experiments were performed in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, two weeks after bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was produced by the puncture of the posterior communicating artery in six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, the arterial blood of non-reserpinized dog was injected into the cisterna magna of another six reserpinized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameter changes of the cerebral basal arteries before and after the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were observed utilizing the magnified vertebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction 30 minutes after the puncture of the artery in the sympathectomized dogs was milder than that seen in the non-sympathectomized dogs, while vasoconstriction 24 hours after the subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was induced similarly in degree in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reserpinized dogs, vasconstriction 30 minutes after the experimental subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was somewhat milder than that seen in control dogs, and angiograms taken 24 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> showed that vasoconstriction was remarkably milder than in control dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noradrenergic fluorescence of the arterial wall after the puncture of the posterior communicating artery was examined using Falck's fluorescence histochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noradrenergic fluorescence in the arterial wall did not disappear 15 minutes, 24 hours and three weeks after the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these experimental results, it was suggested that the sympathetic innervation to cerebral arteries might contribute to induce early spasm, but not to late spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was speculated that vasoactive <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> released from the damaged brain tissue might play a role in inducing late spasm </plain></SENT>
