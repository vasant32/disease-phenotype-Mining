<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel (KCa) openers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the role of KCa in hemolysate-induced contraction of rabbit cerebral and peripheral arteries: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Iberiotoxin (IBX), a selective KCa channel blocker, produced more pronounced contraction in basilar than in those of carotid or femoral arteries, indicating KCa channels are important regulating factors in cerebral arteries; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NS1619, a selective KCa channel opener, abolished the contraction of basilar artery to erythrocyte lysate, a causative agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rabbit basilar artery, NS1619 relaxed the contractions to IBX, erythrocyte lysate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (20 and 60 mM), indicating that NS1619, besides opening KCa channels, possesses other vasodilating actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that KCa channels are important factors in the regulation of cerebral vascular tension and KCa channel opener NS1619 may have dual relaxant actions in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
