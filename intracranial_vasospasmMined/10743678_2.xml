<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this study 14 dogs were randomly assigned to two groups, a control and a Ginkgo biloba group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group was only administered saline in a volume equivalent to a dose of 100 mgEGb 761/kg while the treatment group was given 100 mg EGb 761/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 1.95 +/- 0.16 mm at day 0 to 1.11 +/- 0.07 mm at day 8 in the control group, while in the treatment group the vessel diameter decreased from 2.01 +/- 0.17 mm at day 0 to 1.72 +/- 0.16 mm at day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results correspond a decrease in vessel diameter of 15.1% in the treatment group and of 43.1% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological studies of the specimens obtained from basilar arteries showed that pathological signs of proliferative vasculopathy, including narrowing of the vessel lumen, corrugation of the lamina elastica and subendothelial thickening, were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals in the control group, while they could not be demonstrated in the Ginkgo biloba group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Ginkgo biloba may have a protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm and vasculopathy as a result of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
