<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The basic mechanism of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) has been intensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is a basic mediator of the cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous clinical and experimental studies have shown a cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect of high cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) however, the mechanism of this effect is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the contribution of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effect of NO to this mechanism in an experimental SAH model using rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Four experimental groups, were designated: Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TDU) in 8 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 animals, intracisternal saline injection and cervical epidural electrode placement without SCS were performed before TDU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TDU was performed before and after SCS on the fourth day of SAH in 8 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 8 animals, N-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">Nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-Arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">Methyl</z:chebi> Esther (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) was administered intracisternally on the fourth day of SAH, at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, 45 minutes before SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBF parameters, obtained via measurements or calculations from TDU data, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The occurrence of vasospasm after SAH was demonstrated with significant changes in TDU parameters (high peak systolic velocity and positive values of the degree of stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH animals, SCS resulted in significant vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Even after the injection of L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, SCS still had a significant vasodilatory effect in SAH animals, but there was also a significant difference in CBF parameters in the SCS-only group when compared with the L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> treatment before SCS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The mechanism of the cerebral vasodilatory effect of SCS remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed the contribution of a neurohumoral effect which can be partially prevented by use of an NO synthase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
