<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis is uncertain, although such cerebrovascular events may result from sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">Amphetamine</z:chebi>, another <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> that is commonly abused, may also cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">Amphetamine</z:chebi> and its derivatives are frequent adulterants of illegally obtained cocaine and may also be used concurrently; the effect(s) of this combination of drugs upon the cerebral vasculature is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to develop an animal model that would enable us to study the ability of these drugs to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and to observe the response to IV administration of <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> and cocaine, either alone or together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnified basilar artery arteriograms were obtained in 12 New Zealand white rabbits before and after IV administration of cocaine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi>, or both, at various dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low doses produced mild vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At higher doses, the animals who received cocaine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> alone showed little or no basilar artery spasm, but coadministration produced definite basilar artery vasospasm, reflecting a synergistic vasoconstrictive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If a similar response exists in the human cerebral vasculature, then this could help explain the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
