<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, vasopressin, and substance P in helical strips of dog middle cerebral, basilar, and posterior communicating arteries to obtain a better understanding of humoral control of cerebrovascular tone in different brain regions and its potential impact on mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A23187 relaxed these different arterial strips partially precontracted with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha to a similar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasopressin produced concentration-dependent relaxation in basilar and posterior communicating arterial strips, whereas middle cerebral arterial strips either contracted or relaxed slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relaxations induced by A23187 and vasopressin were either abolished or converted to contractions by removal of the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the relaxation of cerebral arterial strips to substance P was markedly attenuated but not abolished by endothelium denudation; the remaining relaxation was suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cerebral arterial strips with intact endothelium, substance P caused a transient contraction that was reversed to a relaxation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or ONO-3708, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49023">prostaglandin antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arterial strips denuded of endothelium from the same dogs, substance P always produced relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relaxations of cerebral arterial strips to A23187 and vasopressin appear to be mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The function of vasopressin receptors in endothelial cells differs markedly in basilar and posterior communicating arteries versus middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substance P-induced relaxations appear to be primarily associated with endothelium-derived relaxing factor and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi>, whereas contractions appear to be mediated by endothelium-derived <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
