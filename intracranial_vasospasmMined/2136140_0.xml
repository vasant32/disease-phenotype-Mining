<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In summary, over a period of approximately four decades, an important new pathologic process was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no longer any doubt that the deposition of the subarachnoid clot in the basal cisterns can, over the course of a few days, lead to a progressive, severe vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, can reduce cerebral blood flow to the distal brain, which, depending on a multitude of factors, can result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is highly likely that the erythrocyte is the most important blood element in the pathophysiology of this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism by which the blood vessel is forced into this destructive spasm remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant steps have been taken to avoid the consequences of vasospasm by using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> (or at the very least avoiding iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These measures have resulted in a reduced incidence of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because clot has been shown to cause vasospasm, it has seemed only logical that the early removal of clot would be efficacious in its prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical evidence to support this view has been gathered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic measures based on it have been shown to be effective in the experimental situation but await controlled clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, thanks to such trials, one of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> drugs has been shown to be effective in improving the outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, probably on the basis of reducing the frequency and extent of infarction by small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or neuronal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although patients still die from this lethal complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, it is difficult not to have some measure of optimism, based on the history just reviewed, that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> will be a treatable disease within a few decades </plain></SENT>
