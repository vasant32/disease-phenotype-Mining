<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the early clinical results, quantitative angiographic and sonographic findings, and final outcome in patients with symptomatic vasospasm who had undergone surgical occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and a structured protocol including aggressive intensive care management, endovascular procedures (EP), and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (BC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (19 women, 11 men, age: 51 +/- 8 years) underwent 38 EP for the treatment of 81 vascular territories (15 balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> and 66 papaverine infusions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall angiographic vasospasm in the intradural ICA improved significantly from 44.7 +/- 19.8% to 16.5 +/- 16%, in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> from 44.2 +/- 14.7% to 14.4 +/- 14%, and in the ACA from 38.7 +/- 18.6% to 13.3 +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocities (Vm) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA decreased significantly from 135 +/- 48 cm/sec to 87 +/- 32 cm/sec and from 110 +/- 36 cm/sec to 84 +/- 30 cm/sec, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant Vm improvement in the ICA could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (20%) developed intractable vasospasm after repeated EP and five patients underwent BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient between percentage of angiographic vasospasm and Vm increase was -0.19 (p = NS) for the ICA, 0.2 (p &lt; 0.001) for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and 0.3 (p &lt; 0.05) for the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficient between percentages of angiographic and sonographic improvement was -0.12 (p = NS) for the ICA, 0.42 (p &lt; 0.001), and 0.1 (p &lt; 0.05) for the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early clinical improvement after EP was observed in 73% of patients and was significantly associated with favourable outcome (GOS 4-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (53%) had a GOS 5, six patients (20%) a GOS 4, six patients (20%) a GOS 3, and two patients (6.6%) died as consequence of devastating vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in vessel diameter and increases of Vm during vasospasm correlate weakly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In spite of the fact that significant differences in vessel diameter and Vm were demonstrated after treatment, a moderately good correlation between percentages of angiographic and Vm improvement was observed only in the M1 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our experience, a reduction of mortality and disabilities can be achieved with a maximal structured treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early clinical improvement after endovascular treatment is strongly associated with favourable outcome, nevertheless, cost-benefit and controlled trials are necessary to evaluate these techniques </plain></SENT>
