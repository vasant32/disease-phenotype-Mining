<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>42 cases concerning symptomatic intracranial circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and spontaneous SAH have been observed by the authors during the period 1965-1984; 37 of them were treated from 1970 on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group represents 2.6% in the number of patients treated for SAH during the above mentioned period in the series of Pavia and Verona Neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases angiography did not evidence any malformation responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases have been defined as "sine materia" SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 33 cases was documented the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> as responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 2 remaining cases was found an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that even if unbroken had manifested itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were mycotic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent sites of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been the carotid artery bifurcation and the middle cerebral artery 24% each one followed by the anterior communicating artery 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 patients were younger than 4 years and each one had peculiar clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 37 remaining patients were older than 9 years and have been subdivided in 2 groups: 16 patients from 9 to 15 years old in who the most common site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was the carotid artery bifurcation and the middle cerebral artery (31%) and the frequency of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was 50%; 21 patients from 16 to 20 years old in who the most common site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was the anterior communicating artery (33%) and the presence of an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was markedly inferior (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>23 of the 35 patients having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent a surgical procedure for its exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality rate was nearly 5% and morbidity rate was nearly 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 patients who were in agony when admitted were not operated; 5 patients had a conservative therapy and in 2 of them an angiography performed at distance from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> revealed the disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical disturbances bound to ischemic phenomenons by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were observed in only 3 patients--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them older than 17--in who a CT scan had showed a conspicuous cisternal blood suffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 13% of cases appeared <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and only in 3 cases was necessary to perform a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The global results of therapy have been significantly better than in adults having 74% of good results and 19% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This prognostic improvement is probably due both to the well known recovery from neurological failure in young patients and to the very low incidence of ischemic manifestations from vasospasm in this range of age </plain></SENT>
