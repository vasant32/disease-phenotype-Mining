<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study whether endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase gene (eNOS) polymorphisms is implicated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were selected to test this hypothesis, including 98 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (ASAH), 96 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (TSAH), and 195 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal or traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parents of 194 patients and 100 control subjects were also examined for transmission disequilibrium test according to a family-based study design to test the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined four eNOS gene polymorphisms, and two of these polymorphisms, the T to C substitution in the promoter at position -786 and the a-deletion/b-insertion in intron 4, were found to associate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the case-control comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the former polymorphism, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was higher in C allele homozygotes than in the other two genotypes (odds ratio: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4 to 5.6); for the latter polymorphism, the a-deletion carriers were exposed to a increased risk (odds ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.0) in comparison with the noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two polymorphisms were analyzed together as haplotypes in a family-based study using the transmission disequilibrium test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C/a-deletion haplotype was transmitted from the heterozygous parents to cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> with a significantly higher frequency than expected (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of the case-control and family-based studies clearly demonstrate that DNA sequence differences in eNOS gene influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
