<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The influence of vasoconstrictors of intracranial arteries on the amplitude and configuration of the intracranial pulse wave (ICPW) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous pressure recordings from the descending aorta (systemic arterial pressure) and the third cerebral ventricle (intracranial pressure) were obtained from anesthetized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized analysis of the configuration, amplitude, and frequency spectrum of ventricular wave (ICPW) and aortic pulse wave (SAPW) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) was injected intracisternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 24 control cats, 2 ml artificial CSF was injected into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This produced a significant increase in amplitude of the ICPW but no change in the SAPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten animals received 14 intracisternal injections of 2 ml autologous blood which caused narrowing of the amplitude of the ICPW as well as of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> its components (P1, P2, and P3), with no significant change in the SAPW's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight animals were also subjected to cisternal injection of 2 ml of a 10(-4)-M solution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>, resulting in findings similar to those produced by autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency spectrum of the intracranial and aortic pulse waves showed a high degree of correlation between wave amplitudes and height of the fundamental wave in the FFT record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> that follows cisternal injections of blood and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in cats can be diagnosed by analysis of the ICPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method may allow early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
