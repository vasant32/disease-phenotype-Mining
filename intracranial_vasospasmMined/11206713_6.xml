<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used this method to study the change of gene expression profiles in animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found novel drug target candidates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> through pharmacogenomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using differential display and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was prominently induced in the basilar artery and modestly in brain tissue in a murine vasospasm model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the degree of vasospasm and HO-1 mRNA levels in the basilar arteries exhibiting vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antisense HO-1 oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) inhibited HO-1 induction in the basilar arteries, but not in the whole brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was not observed in the nontreatment, sense HO-1 ODN and scrambled ODN treatment arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report, for the first time, the protective effects of HO-1 gene induction by endogenous or clinical compounds in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, a finding that should provide a novel therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
