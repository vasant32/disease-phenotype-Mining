<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated rabbit basilar artery was examined using an isometric tension recording method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five rabbits that had 2 successive blood injections were divided into 3 groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals (control), 4 days, and 3 weeks after the first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) (10(-6)-10(-4) M) were used to evoke dose-dependent vasodilation of isolated arterial rings previously contracted by 10(-6) M <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the animals killed 4 days after the first SAH, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>- and ATP-induced relaxation were suppressed, and the degree of relaxation of this group was 38 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and 22 +/- 3.9% of the initial contractile tone in response to 10(-4) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and 10(-4) M ATP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suppression of the relaxation induced by ATP was seen even in the animals killed 3 weeks after the first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> in the arterial rings from the animals killed 4 days after the first SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present experiments suggest that impairment of the endothelium-dependent vasodilation following SAH may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
