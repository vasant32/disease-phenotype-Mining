<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that the plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) level is related to the sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is expected that the changes in sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function are accompanied by the release of NE at the sympathetic nerve terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are many reports on the correlation between autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunction and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, ECG evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to know whether the measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> concentrations could assess clinical status and have a prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the plasma NE, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (E) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) concentrations in thirty patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 48 hours of admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were evaluated by Hunt &amp; Hess grade depending on the clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure estimations, ECG tracing and a blood sample were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of the patients was assessed on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The "good" group consisted of patients who recovered completely or with minimal disabilities, and could lead independent lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The blood samples were assayed by the high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Plasma NE levels in the patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> were significantly higher than those in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plasma E levels in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> were also higher than the concentrations in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
