<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor and therefore is considered to be an active principle in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possible role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> on the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, however, has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> on cerebral vessel tone was therefore examined using in vitro tissue bath techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi> (10(-5)-3 X 10(-5) M) induced strong constriction of cerebral arteries from the cat, dog, and pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction returned to baseline after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was washed by prewarmed Krebs solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasomotor responses to various vasoactive substances were then examined after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was washed away (the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> postwash effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE)-induced but not <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>)-induced constrictions were significantly potentiated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> postwash effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potentiated NE-induced constriction was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10093">yohimbine</z:chebi> but not by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This enhanced vasoconstriction was mimicked by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, suggesting that the potentiation of NE-induced constriction by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> postwash effect was mediated by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> postwash effect also resulted in blockade of endothelium-dependent vasodilations induced by A-23147, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, and ATP without affecting relaxations induced by direct <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51371">muscle relaxants</z:chebi> such as beta-adrenoceptors, papaverine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> induces direct vasoconstriction, potentiates alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> may promote an enhanced overall vasoconstriction in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">Bilirubin</z:chebi>, therefore, may be involved in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
