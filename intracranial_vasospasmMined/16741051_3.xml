<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of continuous intravenous infusion of a highly selective endothelin-converting enzyme-1 inhibitor, CGS 35066, on the prevention and reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to SAH by injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of CGS 35066 at dosages of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/ day was initiated either 1 hr and 24 hrs later in the prevention and reversal protocols, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed by perfusion-fixation 48 hrs after SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional areas of basilar arteries were measured using computer-assisted videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes in basilar arteries were determined using electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CGS 35066 significantly prevented and reversed the arterial narrowing after SAH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean cross-sectional areas of arteries from animals in both the prevention and reversal protocol groups that received 10 mg/kg/day of CGS 35066 did not differ significantly from those of the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological studies of the basilar artery in the 10 mg/kg/day treatment group did not show pathomorphological changes, such as corrugation of the endothelium seen at 2 days after SAH induction or vacuole formation in the endothelial cells noted in the vehicle-treated SAH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CGS 35066 is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It also prevents the pathological changes in vascular walls due to SAH </plain></SENT>
