<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> remains an unpredictable and inadequately treated complication of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel activator cromakalim is capable of limiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in rabbits when administered immediately after experimental SAH (i.e. before spastic constriction has been initiated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ultimate clinical value of cromakalim for treating vasospasm will depend in part on its effectiveness when administered after SAH-induced constriction has already been initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effects of cromakalim on vasospasm when treatment was initiated after SAH-induced constriction was underway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to experimental SAH by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cromakalim (0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intravenously at 8 hour intervals beginning 24 hours post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed by perfusion fixation 48 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and cross-sectional area was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The average cross sectional areas of basilar arteries were reduced by 64% and 68% in the SAH-only and SAH + vehicle groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with cromakalim dose-dependently attenuated SAH-induced constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The groups treated with 0.03, 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1, and 0.3 mg/kg cromakalim exhibited average decreases in cross-sectional area of 57%, 42%, and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that cromakalim dose-dependently attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> when administered 24 hours after experimental SAH in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest K(ATP) channel activators, such as cromakalim. could be of benefit for reversing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
