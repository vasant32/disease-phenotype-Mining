<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presence of the APOE4 allele is associated with poorer response to traumatic brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but the association between APOE genotype and outcome following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this project was to investigate the association between APOE genotype and outcome after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also explored the association of APOE4 genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) presence in a subsample of our population with available angiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sample of 206 aneurysmal SAH participants had APOE genotyping performed, Glasgow outcome scores (GOS) and modified Rankin scores (MRS) collected at 3 and 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the presence of the APOE4 genotype and functional outcomes controlling for age, race, size of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (Fisher grade), and severity of injury (Hunt &amp; Hess grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However when controlling for CV and the covariates listed above, individuals with the APOE4 allele had worse functional outcomes at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the APOE2 allele was not associated with functional outcomes even when considering presence of CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mortality associated with APOE4 presence, APOE2 presence, or presence of CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest APOE4 allele is associated with poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
