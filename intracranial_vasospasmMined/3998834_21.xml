<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a reduced CBF (less than 50 ml/min-1/100 gm brain-1) and diffuse subarachnoid blood on computerized tomography had a very high incidence (78%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, despite a good clinical grade at the time of measurement </plain></SENT>
