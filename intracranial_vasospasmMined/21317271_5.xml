<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vasospasm-induced delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> remains a major source of morbidity in patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that activating innate neurovascular protective mechanisms by preconditioning (PC) may represent a novel therapeutic approach against SAH-induced vasospasm and neurological deficits and, secondarily, that the neurovascular protection it provides is mediated by endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> mice were subjected to hypoxic PC or normoxia followed 24 hours later by SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was analyzed daily; vasospasm was assessed on post-surgery Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> availability, eNOS expression, and eNOS activity were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and eNOS-null mice were subjected to hypoxic PC or normoxia followed by SAH and assessed for vasospasm and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PC nearly completely prevented SAH-induced vasospasm and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also prevented SAH-induced reduction in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> availability and increased eNOS activity in mice with and without SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PC-induced protection against vasospasm and neurological deficits was lost in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice treated with the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> and in eNOS-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous protective mechanisms against vasospasm exist, are powerful, and can be induced by PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>eNOS-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is a critical mediator of PC-induced neurovascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide strong "proof-of-principle" evidence that PC represents a promising new strategy to reduce vasospasm and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after SAH </plain></SENT>
