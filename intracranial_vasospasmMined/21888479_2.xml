<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While long-term intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NaNO(2)) can prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH, it is not known if the intravenous administration of this compound can reverse established SAH-induced vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if the intravenous infusion of NaNO(2) can reverse established vasospasm, the authors infused primates with the compound after SAH-induced vasospasm was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm was created in 14 cynomolgus macaques via subarachnoid implantation of a 5-ml blood clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 7 after clot implantation, animals were randomized to either control (saline infusion, 5 monkeys) or treatment groups (intravenous NaNO(2) infusion at 300 μg/kg/hr for 3 hours [7 monkeys] or 8 hours [2 monkeys]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriographic vessel diameter was blindly analyzed to determine the degree of vasospasm before, during, and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolites (<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>, nitrate, and S-nitrosothiols) were measured in whole blood and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate-to-severe vasospasm was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals before treatment (control, 36.2% ± 8.8% [mean ± SD]; treatment, 45.5% ± 12.5%; p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While saline infusion did not reduce vasospasm, NaNO(2) infusion significantly reduced the degree of vasospasm (26.9% ± 7.6%; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversal of the vasospasm lasted more than 2 hours after cessation of the infusion and could be maintained with a prolonged infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> (peak value, 3.7 ± 2.1 μmol/L), nitrate (18.2 ± 5.3 μmol/L), and S-nitrosothiols (33.4 ± 11.4 nmol/L) increased significantly in whole blood, and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> increased significantly in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the intravenous infusion of NaNO(2) can reverse SAH-induced vasospasm in primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further, these findings indicate that a similar treatment paradigm could be useful in reversing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
