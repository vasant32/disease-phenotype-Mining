<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to explore whether the levels of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association was suggested by the known <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in vasospasm and the role of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in regulating leukocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to, and migration across, vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective analysis was performed on CSF samples obtained in 17 patients who had suffered a recent aneurysmal SAH and in 16 control patients by using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for E-selectin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and L-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of soluble forms of E-selectin (p=0.0013), ICAM-1 (p=0.0001), and VCAM-1 (p=0.048) were found to be elevated in the CSF of patients after SAH compared with levels in the CSF of norminal controls, patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and patients tested months after SAH occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, individual patients tested at the time of their initial ictus demonstrated a fall in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule levels over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of E-selectin (p=0.044) were highest in patients who later developed moderate or severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> molecules are known to be involved in white cell adherence to the endothelium and subsequent diapedesis and migration in which a role in initiation of tissue damage is postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors have demonstrated the elevation of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, with severely elevated levels of E-selectin seen in patients who later develop vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A correlation with a role of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is suggested </plain></SENT>
