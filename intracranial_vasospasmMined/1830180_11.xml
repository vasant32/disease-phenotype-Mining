<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of platelet function in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we compared sequential changes of platelet aggregability and beta-thromboglobulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> concentrations in blood samples from the internal jugular and peripheral vein of 13 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet function in blood from the internal jugular vein tended to be enhanced during days 0-1 but recovered to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range during days 2-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After day 5, platelet function showed various patterns depending on the presence of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients without symptomatic vasospasm, sequential changes were relatively minor, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly high values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic vasospasm already showed high platelet aggregability during the early stage of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of beta-thromboglobulin increased several days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasospasm, reaching 80 ng/ml or more in patients with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the five patients with symptomatic vasospasm showed markedly high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> after day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that vasospasm activates platelets and promotes aggregability and that the resulting increased tendency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation may affect the patient's prognosis during the advanced stage </plain></SENT>
