<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteriography is the standard test for determining the presence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> was undertaken to assess the sensitivity and specificity of SPECT for diagnosis of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were hospitalized after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 2 patients were hospitalized for elective aneurysmal clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' condition on discharge was correlated to clinical and SPECT evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vasospasm was defined as the new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological signs and symptoms not explained by rebleed or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 SPECT studies were performed for 16 patients during their admission and 14 of 16 patients had a single angiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of 16 patients had 14 episodes of clinical evidence of vasospasm and 14 SPECT studies were performed in these 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT in this retrospective study were 89% (8/9) and 71% (5/7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our small sample of arteriograms yielded in comparison a sensitivity of 67% (2/3) and specificity of 100% (9/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The one false-negative SPECT study occurred in conjunction with the one false-negative arteriogram in the presence of clinical findings consistent with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three false-positive SPECT studies occurred in 2 patients who had perfusion abnormalities in areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT findings without clinical or arteriographic evidence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five of 5 patients who died became unresponsive as a result of clinically presumed vasospasm and 4 of 5 of these patients had diffuse or hemispheric SPECT perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients who survived, none became unresponsive; 1 of 11 had positive diffuse or hemispheric perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SPECT is a sensitive and fairly specific test for corroboration of clinical findings of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A negative SPECT study may obviate the need for arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Unresponsiveness is the best predictor of poor outcome; however, hemispheric SPECT perfusion deficits are also associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
