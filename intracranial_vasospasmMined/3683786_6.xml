<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the antiproteases leupeptin and pepstatin were studied to ascertain whether these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> might inhibit contraction as does antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal contraction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> was used as a standard for comparing the responses elicited by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, the decay of the responses to the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> over 15 minutes was used as an index of desensitization, and the percentage of decrease in response to a second application of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> over the first was a measure of tachyphylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that desensitization and tachyphylaxis greatly reduced or abolished the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, arginine vasopressin, substance P, neuropeptide Y, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi>, thrombin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi>, melittin, and cathepsin D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some arteries failed to respond to some of these <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, and no contractile response was elicited by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> or bradykinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandins E2</z:chebi>, D2, and F2 alpha, as well as plasmin, produced sustained contractions, without tachyphylaxis, but only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> and plasmin produced contractions at concentrations of 10(-7) M or less that were comparable to those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the antiprotease <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> inhibited the responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> whereas small concentrations (6 X 10(-8) M) of antithrombin III did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results support the hypotheses that the phenomenon of desensitization and tachyphylaxis would prevent many diverse agents from acting as spasmogens and that substances like antithrombin III present in the cerebrospinal fluid after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> could immediately protect patients from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
