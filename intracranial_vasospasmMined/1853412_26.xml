<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours later the basilar artery was exposed via the transclival approach and photographed at high-power magnification through an operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated the effect of topical (n = 30) and intravenous (n = 20) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> on the spastic artery by computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A greater than 50% reduction in baseline diameter of the basilar artery was observed in the rats subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> compared with the 10 controls (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> dilated the spastic artery to approximately 75% of the baseline diameter in control rats (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> caused dramatic dilation of the basilar artery in both the control and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> groups to near 150% of the baseline diameter in the controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats receiving intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> reached therapeutic plasma levels of the ion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic effects were mild and immediately reversible upon cessation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> has a role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>-induced vasospasm in humans </plain></SENT>
