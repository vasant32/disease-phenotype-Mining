<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on October 20, 1986, with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsurgery was performed immediately on the day of admission because cerebral angiography revealed bilateral distal anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consciousness gradually deteriorated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> from the 3rd day following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To protect the brain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> 1500 mg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 252 mg) was administered for 26 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of treatment, in March 1987 neurological examination revealed akinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo>, but CT scan did not reveal any evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scan performed on May 2, 1987, revealed a mass lesion in the left frontotemporal lobes and left basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (diffuse, large-cell type) was obtained by stereotactic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy (41 Gy of 60Co) was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CT scan performed on August 26, 1987 revealed that the abnormal enhanced lesion had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, neurological findings had not remarkably improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> in February 1988, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence had not been noted in CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Autopsy could not be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whole body CT scan and 67Gd scintigram did not reveal any other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> except in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> followed by primary intracranial malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is very rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In such cases, which have unusual clinical courses and CT findings, we recommend stereotactic biopsy to treat this kind of radiosensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The connection between malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and immunosuppression has been considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
