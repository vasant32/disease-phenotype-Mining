<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the feasibility and safety of a single dose of intravenous dantrolene and its effect on transcranial Doppler in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, open-label, single-dose ascending safety trial, 5 patients received intravenous dantrolene 1.25 mg/kg and the next 5 patients received 2.5 mg/kg over the course of 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other infusions were kept steady and hemodynamic parameters were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was performed at 0, 45, 90, and 135 minutes relative to infusion start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic chemistries, serum osmolality, arterial blood gas, and liver enzymes were measured before and after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laboratory values and hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged except for a decrease in the systolic blood pressure in the low-dose group (-8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -26 to 10 mm Hg; P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After correcting for this decrease in blood pressure, peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocities decreased significantly (-26 cm/s; 95% CI, -47 to -5 cm/s; P=0.02), with a borderline change in mean velocities in the low-dose group (-16 cm/s; 95% CI, -36 to 4 cm/s; P=0.07) and peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocity in the high-dose group (-26 cm/s; 95% CI, -56 to 5 cm/s; P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a single dose of intravenous dantrolene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> appears feasible while inhibiting vasoconstriction in the low-dose group, but it may lower blood pressure </plain></SENT>
