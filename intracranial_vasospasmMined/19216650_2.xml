<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The use of nicardipine prolonged-release implants (NPRIs) is associated with a significant improvement in the therapy of patients suffering from aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) regarding the occurrence and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and functional outcome (FO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because quality of life (QOL) measurements more reliably seem to describe the patient's true condition, the present study was conducted to assess FO and QOL 1 year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture in patients with and without NPRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the initial series of 32 patients, 18 were assessed 1 year after aSAH (7 of the control and 11 of the NPRI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent neurological investigation, a structured interview followed by a measurement of QOL (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]; 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]; and the Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no intergroup differences in the patient characteristics (that is, localization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, initial Hunt and Hess grade, or age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to the previously reported improvement of the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores, the NPRI group's Karnofsky Performance Scale and the MMSE scores were markedly to significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05 [Karnofsky Performance Scale] and p = 0.053 [MMSE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, oblivion, and mild symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were equally present in both study groups (p = 0.607 [<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>]; p = 0.732 [oblivion]; and p = 0.509 [Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no intergroup differences were observed in any of the SF-36 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scores in the SF-36 domains of Role-Physical, Vitality, and Role-Emotional were significantly reduced in the NRPI group compared with those observed in an age-matched control population (p &lt; 0.001 [Role-Physical]; p = 0.001 [vitality]; and p = 0.01 [Role-Emotional]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering consequent costs, no difference was detectable regarding the duration of in- and outpatient rehabilitation (p = 0.135 and 0.171, respectively) or the Prolo score (p = 0.094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite FO improvement in terms of a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, morbidity in the treatment of aSAH in patients with NPRIs, a patient's QOL seems to be related to the severity of the aSAH itself </plain></SENT>
