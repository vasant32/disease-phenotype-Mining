<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: forty-six patients who had undergone 2D DSA and 3DRA for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3DRA was routinely performed after standard 2D DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3D volume rendering images were created from 3DRA dataset and compared with DSA for the detection and characterization of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Of the 46 patients investigated, 25 had vasospasm on 2D DSA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No vasospasm was observed in 21 patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the reference standard of DSA, 46 spastic segments were found in 25 patients with vasospasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 51 spastic segments were found on 3DRA volume rendering angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 3DRA for detecting vasospasm were 100, 76, 90, 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the pseudo-spasm phenomenon was frequently observed on 3DRA volume rendering images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3DRA was less useful than 2D DSA for evaluation of vasospasm after SAH </plain></SENT>
