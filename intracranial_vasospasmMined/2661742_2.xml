<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical usefulness of intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of cerebral perfusion during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery has received little attention, primarily due to problems with electrode placement over the operative site, which is the area of maximal risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, 27 patients undergoing surgery for anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were monitored intraoperatively with a two-channel computerized EEG complex using a bilateral frontal-occipital montage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG pattern was observed throughout surgery; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 awoke neurologically intact and their postoperative angiograms did not reveal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other 11 patients, one of two patterns of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) In six of these patients a marked attenuation of EEG activity was observed ipsilaterally which coincided with various intraoperative events including brain retraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> dissection/clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of these six patients awoke with new neurological deficits which persisted beyond 12 hours in two, both of whom had angiographically proven vasospasm 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2) In the remaining five patients, a distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> pattern consisting of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges was observed ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these five patients had a poor neurological outcome and vasospasm on their angiogram 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, EEG monitoring which spans the operative area during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery is practicable and appears to be of value in the detection of compromised cerebral perfusion during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> patterns identified in this report is discussed </plain></SENT>
