<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors summarize the effects of calcium entry blockers, review the pharmacology of nimodipine, and discuss both the known and possible interactions of oral nimodipine with physical and pharmacological interventions that neuroanesthesiologists employ for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> during craniotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a series of 26 patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, the authors found that intraoperative blood pressure tended to be reduced by nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the number of patients was limited by the fact that they were enrolled in a multi-center nimodipine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> study and thus had to meet the criteria for that study, it is concluded that prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with nimodipine in patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> results only in a favorable tendency toward lower systemic blood pressure during craniotomy </plain></SENT>
