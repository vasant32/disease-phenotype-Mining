<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Endovascular treatments such as transluminal balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial nimodipine represent rescue therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CVS) after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both indication and data regarding its efficacy in the prevention of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> are, however, inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> based perfusion weighted imaging/diffusion weighted imaging (PWI/DWI) mismatch was used to indicate this treatment and to characterise its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI was performed for suspicion of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For quantitative evaluation, the brain was partitioned into 19 arbitrary segments of comparable volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Segments with PWI/DWI mismatch were defined as 'segment at risk (SR)' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cases, MRI was followed by angiography (digital subtraction angiography (DSA)) including endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>48 ± 12 h after treatment, a second MRI was performed and the treatment was repeated if new or remaining SR were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was classified as the percentage of reduced diameter of the proximal cerebral arteries on DSA following the treatment: mild (≥33%), moderate (34-66%) or severe (≥67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 48 treatment cycles, each consisting of MRI, DSA and a second MRI, were performed in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During these cycles, 95 SR were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate was significantly higher in SR (37%) compared with segments without risk (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate in SR was significantly reduced if mild proximal CVS could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the case of persistent severe CVS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present series suggests that PWI/DWI mismatch is predictive of the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the case of CVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate could, however, be improved if proximal CVS was sufficiently reduced </plain></SENT>
