<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> the pre- and postoperative serum and CSF levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> were measured as a function of their stable hydrolysis products, 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>), with a highly specific radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of both metabolites were elevated in half of the patients, but no correlation to the clinical course could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> concentration in the CSF was significantly increased preoperatively with close correlation to the amount of intracisternal blood, as detected by CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the postoperative course of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> concentrations in the CSF reflects the clinical course in such a way that a characteristic secondary rise of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>, concentration postoperatively is closely related to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is drawn that measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites in the CSF may provide important information concerning the pathophysiological events following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, especially with regard to incipient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
