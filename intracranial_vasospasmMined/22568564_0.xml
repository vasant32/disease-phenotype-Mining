<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A typology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has been proposed based on distinct clinical manifestations: delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, symptomatic 'vasospasm', angiographic vasospasm, and transcranial Doppler vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined each distinct clinical manifestation in a nonparametric genetic association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine and compare each four distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical manifestations and test its perspectives in genetic association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred forty-five Caucasian patients with sub-arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were evaluated for these four distinct clinical manifestations along with 906 600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The four clinical manifestations were significantly associated with each other as P-values ranged from 3·31 × 10(-4) to 8·10 × 10(-15)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler vasospasm showed significant genetic association with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs999662, P = 3·39 × 10(-8) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical P-value of rs999662 in association with delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, symptomatic 'vasospasm', and angiographic vasospasm was 0·0017, 0·0017, and 0·19, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite different criteria for each of the four clinical manifestations, they are significantly associated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest transcranial Doppler vasospasm may be an appropriate intermediate but still clinically relevant phenotype for genetic association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Association with SNP rs999662 indicates a potential role for the region containing the solute carrier family 12 member 3 (SLC12A3) gene in transcranial Doppler vasospasm following sub-arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
