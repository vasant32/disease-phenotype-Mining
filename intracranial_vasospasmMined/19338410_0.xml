<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)-related vasospasm is rare in children and has not been reported in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report the authors present the case of a 22-month-old child who developed clinically symptomatic, radiographically identifiable vasospasm after traumatic SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of vasospasm associated with SAH in a child this young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This 22-month-old boy fell and had a dense SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had a history of surgically corrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and nonsymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The boy was evaluated for occult vascular lesions using imaging; none were found and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel caliber was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten days later, the child developed left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and a right middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation disclosed significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis was supported by findings on CT angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The child was treated using intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> with a good result, as well as with conventional intensive care measures to reduce vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This report documents the first known case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial vasospasm</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after SAH in a patient under the age of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding is important because it demonstrates that the entity of SAH-associated vasospasm can affect the very young, widening the spectrum of ages susceptible to this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This case is also important because it demonstrates that even very young children can respond to conventional therapeutic interventions such as intraarterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of vasospasm as a potential diagnosis when evaluating young children with SAH </plain></SENT>
