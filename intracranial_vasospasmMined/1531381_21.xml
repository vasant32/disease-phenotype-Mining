<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the reported effects of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in clinical cases have been dramatic, few experimental studies of the mechanism of action have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also is still unclear why dilated arteries rarely show restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the scanning electron microscope, we examined changes in the three-dimensional structure of connective tissues in vessel walls after balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Femoral arteries from cats and middle cerebral arteries from human autopsies were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vessels were dilated in situ with a balloon catheter until the intimal pressure reached 1.5 Wr 3 atm; then they were fixed and digested with 88% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specimens were freeze dried and observed under the scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> vessels without balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were treated in the same manner and used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure of collagen fibers in the vessel walls was affected significantly by balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stretched and torn fibers were observed frequently when 3 atm were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the long-lasting effects of balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> may be caused by the disruption of connective tissues that proliferate in the vessel wall after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
