<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the usefulness of near infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) for detection of vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated seven aneurysmal SAH patients with poor clinical conditions (WFNS grade V) who underwent endovascular coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Employing TRS, we measured the oxygen saturation (SO(2)) and baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in the cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of TRS and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) were performed repeatedly for 14 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four of the seven patients, the SO(2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations measured in the brain tissue of the middle cerebral artery territory remained stable after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in three patients, TRS revealed abrupt decreases in SO(2) and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> between 5 and 9 days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography performed on the same day revealed severe vasospasms in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although TCD detected the vasospasm in two of three cases, it failed to do so in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TRS could detect vasospasms after SAH by evaluating the cortical blood oxygenation </plain></SENT>
