<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basilar arteries were quickly frozen after careful removal of surrounding blood clot and their level of immunoreactive endothelin-1, a strong vasoconstrictor produced by the endothelial and vascular smooth-muscle cells, was measured by sandwich-enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of immunoreactive endothelin-1 (mean +/- standard deviation) were 112.9 +/- 7.0 pg/mg protein prior to vasospasm, 180.4 +/- 24.7 pg/mg protein on Day 2 after vasospasm, and 115.0 +/- 24.0 pg/mg protein on Day 7, showing a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in immunoreactive endothelin-1 only on Day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, vasospasm was moderately reversed by the topical application of monoclonal antibody against endothelin-1 on Day 2 but rather resistant to topical monoclonal antibody on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that endothelin-1 could act as a trigger in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, but that the maintenance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> at later stages might be independent of endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
