<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The availability of a mouse model of SAH that is simple, replicable and has low mortality would provide a powerful approach for understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to post-SAH pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study characterizes a mouse model of experimental SAH, which produces consistent constriction of large cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult mice received injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna, and the diameters of large intracranial vessels were measured 1 h to 7 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diffuse blood clot was evident in both the anterior and posterior circulations after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular wall thickening, lumenal narrowing and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (6-12 h) and delayed (1-3 days) phases of vasoconstriction occurred after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was only 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reproducible, low mortality model of SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in mice is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This mouse model should facilitate the delineation of cellular and molecular mechanisms of SAH-induced pathologies because of the widespread availability of various technologies for this species (e.g. genetically-altered animals and gene expression arrays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This model also represents a replicable and inexpensive approach for screening therapeutic candidates </plain></SENT>
