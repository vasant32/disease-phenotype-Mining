<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> has neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus of vasospastic SAH rabbits or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An experimental SAH model was formed by injecting 0.9 mL of autologous arterial blood per 1 kg of body weight to the cisterna magna of 12 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Craniotomy was performed in the control group (n = 6) except performing experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbits in the SAH-alone (n = 6) group were infused with 5 mL.kg(-1).h(-1) 0.9% <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi>, and rabbits (n = 6) in the SAH-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> group were infused with 5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> for 2 hours, 48 hours after SAH was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rabbits of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were sacrificed via penthotal 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed immediately, and hippocampal tissues were blocked from the right hemisphere for histopathologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to this, hippocampal tissues of left hemispheres were dissected for biochemical analyses to evaluate <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, activity of XO, and SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histopathologic study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> may have a neuroprotective effect in SAH-induced hippocampal injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The biochemical parameters support the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> may have a neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus of vasospastic SAH rabbits </plain></SENT>
