<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> for the treatment of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with angiographically confirmed vasospasm received intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> between January 2006 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The improvement in diameter of vessel (in millimeters) following treatment was assessed by paired t test for statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiographic improvement of supraclinoid internal carotid artery, M1 segment of middle cerebral artery, and A1 and A2 segment of anterior cerebral artery was compared with the modified Rankin score of the patients at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 milrinone treatments were performed in 14 patients (11 females and 3 males) with mean age of 52.7 years (31-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant angiographic improvement after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> therapy (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> was a safe and effective treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
