<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was investigated by examining the relation between cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> level ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) and muscle contraction in vascular smooth muscle after experimental vasospasm produced by the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method in the canine basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and tension were recorded simultaneously with a fluorimeter using the arterial strips with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> indicator, fura-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High K+ concentration (72.4 mM) and U-46619 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> analogue, 10(-8) M) were used as stimulants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in contractile tension per [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i per unit cross-sectional area was calculated, and compared for the vasospasm and the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in the vasospasm group was smaller than that in the control group, so the increase in tension per [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i per unit sectional area was larger in the vasospasm group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This value was much larger for the contraction induced by U-46619 than that induced by high K+ concentration in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is an increase in the basal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitivity of the contractile elements in vasospastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the U-46619-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitivity seemed to be augmented in the vasospasm group </plain></SENT>
