<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is a major cause of brain damages after SAH, other factors such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> also contribute to high mortality after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">Trehalose</z:chebi> is a non-reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi> in which two <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> units are linked by α,α-1,1-glycosidic bond, and has been shown to induce tolerance to a variety of stressors in numerous organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by blood in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme immunoassay for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi>, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and endothelin-1, and western blotting analysis for cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, and inhibitor of NF-κB were examined in macrophage-like cells treated with hemolysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with hemolysate and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, the levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> and amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> release were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of experimental SAH, 18 Japanese White rabbits received an injection of saline, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17306">maltose</z:chebi> into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic and histological analyses of the basilar arteries were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a separate study, the femoral arteries from 60 rats were exposed to fresh autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 20 days after treatment, cryosections prepared from the femoral arteries were histologically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When cells were treated with hemolysate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi> inhibited the production of several <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB and also suppressed the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, the reactive oxygen species-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> release in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the rabbit model, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi> produced an inhibitory effect on vasospasm after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of experimental SAH, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17306">maltose</z:chebi> had only a moderate effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the rat femoral arteries exposed to blood were investigated for 20 days, histological analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi> suppressed vasospasm, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">trehalose</z:chebi> has suppressive effects on several pathological events after SAH, including vasospasm, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27082">Trehalose</z:chebi> may be a new therapeutic approach for treatment of complications after SAH </plain></SENT>
