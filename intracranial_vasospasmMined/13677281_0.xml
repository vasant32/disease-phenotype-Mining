<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative echocardiography demonstrated moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion (1900 ml.day-1) was performed to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, but the patient developed lung <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She received delayed surgical treatment after the improvement of lung symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (0.1 mg), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (90 mg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> (6 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radial arterial flow was judged to be insufficient for cannulation, and a cannulation was therefore performed on the dorsal pedis artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During induction of anesthesia, there was a significant decrease in the arterial pressure, that required a total of 32 mg of intravenous ephedrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following tracheal intubation, a central venous catheter was inserted and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was continuously administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was positioned in the park bench position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We thought that the placement of the introducer for Swan-Ganz catheter was difficult under the position and Swan-Ganz catheter was not inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was maintained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>, air, and oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We continuously monitored the central venous pressure as an indicator of fluid balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this case, we monitored dorsal pedis arterial pressure directly, which might not be sufficiently reliable to predict the decrease in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
