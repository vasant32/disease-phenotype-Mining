<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiments were performed to investigate the change in contractility of rabbit basilar artery to vasoactive substances in the presence of increased K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contraction heights induced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (5 x 10(-7) M) were increased 2.4 +/- .02 fold, 6.4 +/- 0.3 fold, 5.7 +/- 0.4 fold (n = 10), when the K concentration of physiological solution was elevated to 8.1 mM, 13.5 mM, 24.3 mM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar potentiation was obtained in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tensions induced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha (2.5 x 10(-6) M) were increased 2.3 +/- 0.3 fold, 4.7 +/- 0.4 fold, 3.7 +/- 0.4 fold (n = 6), whereas the responses to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> were rather less potentiated and the maximum height was 2.2 +/- 0.2 fold (n = 8) in 13.5 mM K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of the responses to vasoactive agents was also observed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that slight depolarization of membrane would potentiate the contractile responses to various vasoactive substances and that an increase in sensitivity could be a possible cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
