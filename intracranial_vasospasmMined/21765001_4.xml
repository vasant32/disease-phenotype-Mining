<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurs more frequently, and with earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, in bTBI patients than in patients with other TBI injury modes, such as blunt force trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though vasospasm is usually associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), SAH is not required for vasospasm in bTBI, which suggests that the unique mechanics of blast injury could potentiate vasospasm <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, accounting for the increased incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, using theoretical and in vitro models, we show that a single rapid mechanical insult can induce vascular hypercontractility and remodeling, indicative of vasospasm initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We employed high-velocity stretching of engineered arterial lamellae to simulate the mechanical forces of a blast pulse on the vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An hour after a simulated blast, injured tissues displayed altered intracellular calcium dynamics leading to hypersensitivity to contractile stimulus with endothelin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One day after simulated blast, tissues exhibited blast force dependent prolonged hypercontraction and vascular smooth <z:mp ids='MP_0005369'>muscle phenotype</z:mp> switching, indicative of remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, blast-like injury is sufficient to induce a hypercontraction-induced genetic switch that potentiates vascular remodeling, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, in bTBI patients </plain></SENT>
