<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the various fractions of fresh blood, significant contraction was induced by serum, but moderate contraction was induced by platelet-rich plasma and lysed red cells, while intact red cells and platelet-poor plasma had no significant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contractions induced by serum and platelet-rich plasma were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, while those induced by lysed red cells were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas serum and platelet-rich plasma lost their contractile activity after 24 hours of incubation, lysed red cells retained activity up to 7 days after incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of the hemolysate by means of Sephadex column chromatography revealed that the contractile substance(s) possessed a molecular weight above 5000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility that the above substance(s) may play a role in prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
