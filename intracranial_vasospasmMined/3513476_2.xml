<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF prostacyclin concentration showed a typical decreasing trend, which amounted to a minor form of protection from vasospastic agents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case of developing vasospasm, the cisternal prostacyclin concentration was seven times lower than the highest lumbar CSF concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three cases without evidence of vasospasm cisternal CSF demonstrated a balanced biochemical situation and a minor risk of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
