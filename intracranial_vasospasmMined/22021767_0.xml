<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic control has been a matter of debate, even though several publications reported the effects of changes in sympathetic tone on CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and spinal-cord stimulation have been shown to influence peripheral and cerebral blood flow through a sympathetic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesise that certain pathological conditions result in a relative increase in the neurogenic regulation of CBF and that this regulation can be modulated electrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and analysis Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> will be included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental set-up measures several parameters that are involved in cerebral blood flow regulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements are taken at baseline and with stimulation in several frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An ad hoc statistical analysis is used to evaluate different settings of the electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation is evaluated with transfer function analysis and autoregulatory index calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ethics and dissemination Ethical registration was granted by Medical Review Ethics Committee Groningen (ID METc 2010.123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants provide written informed consent on participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upon finishing a pilot study to investigate feasibility and effect, either future prospective (randomised) studies will be designed, or other modalities of electrical stimulation will be explored using the same set-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Trial Registration Dutch Trial Registry: NTR2358 </plain></SENT>
