<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine New Zealand <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rabbits were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One milliliter of fresh arterial blood was injected through the surgically exposed atlanto-occipital membrane over a period of 20 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was then repeated 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty animals underwent digital subtraction angiography at one of the following prefixed intervals: 1, 3, or 8 days after the second injection <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen animals underwent one angiographic examination prior to the instillation of the intracisternal blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure was followed by a repeated angiography 3 days after the second experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of evaluation, the films were magnified 10-fold and the diameter of the basilar artery as well as that of the extracranial vertebral artery at three different levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diameter of the basilar artery as well as the mean ratio extracranial vertebral artery/basilar artery diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This ratio was considered to minimize anatomical and technical variabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results in the first 50 animals showed a trend suggesting that spasmogenic activity reaches a peak at about the third day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in the latter 19 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, mortality in this group was high: 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This double-injection model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in rabbits consistently reproduced cerebral vascular spasm 3 days after repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, its usefulness as an experimental model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is limited practically by the high animal mortality in the protocols where repeated angiographic studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
