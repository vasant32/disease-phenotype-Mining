<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurs in approximately 70% of patients hospitalized after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and is associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether or not cerebral circulation time (CCT) measured with digital subtraction angiography was associated with angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent cerebral angiography within 24 hours of SAH were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast dye transit time from the arterial to the venous phase was measured to obtain CCT (supraclinoid internal carotid artery to parietal cortical veins) and microvascular CCT (cortical middle cerebral artery to parietal cortical veins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ruptured anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and vasospasm on follow-up angiography (Group A) were compared with patients with SAH without vasospasm (Group B) and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 20 patients in Group A (mean age, 51 +/- 13 yr), 17 patients in Group B (56 +/- 12 yr), and 98 patients in Group C (52 +/- 12 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCT in patients in Group A (7.7 +/- 1.9 s) was significantly longer than those in Groups B (6.6 +/- 1.2 s; P = 0.005) and C (5.9 +/- 1 s; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microvascular CCT in patients in Group A (7.1 +/- 1.8 s) was significantly longer than those in Groups B (6.1 +/- 1.2 s; P = 0.003) and C (5.4 +/- 0.9 s; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prolonged CCT, a measurement of increased small vessel resistance, can be identified within 24 hours after SAH and is associated with subsequent angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that microcirculation changes may be involved in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
