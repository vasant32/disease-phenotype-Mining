<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myosin light chain (MLC) in the spastic basilar artery was reported previously to be phosphorylated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because Rho-kinase, which is activated by the small GTPase Rho, phosphorylates not only MLC but also myosin phosphatase at its myosin-binding subunit (MBS), thus inactivating myosin phosphatase, we examined whether Rho-kinase is involved in the development of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was produced in the canine basilar artery by a 2-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method, and vasocontractions were induced by topical application of 80 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> or 0.5 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> to the canine basilar artery exposed transclivally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of MLC in the basilar artery was increased concurrently with an enhancement in the intensity of vasospasm with the passage of time after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Rho-kinase in the basilar artery was activated concurrently with an increase in the phosphorylation of MBS at Ser854 in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rho-kinase activation levels in vasospasm on days 0 and 2 were comparable to those in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced sustained vasocontraction, respectively, and those in vasospasm on day 7 were markedly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The topical application of Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, to the exposed spastic basilar artery on day 7 induced a dose-dependent dilation, and the intensities of vasospasm and the phosphorylation of MBS and MLC were simultaneously decreased by 10 micromol/L Y-27632, although the decrease in MBS phosphorylation was more marked than the decrease in MLC phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the activation of Rho-kinase and the phosphorylation of MLC and MBS occur concomitantly during vasospasm induced by SAH and suggest that Rho-kinase is involved in the enhancement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in addition to Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase by increasing the phosphorylation of MLC directly or indirectly as a result of the inhibition of myosin phosphatase by its phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
