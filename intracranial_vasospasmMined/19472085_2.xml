<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (SCV) is a morbid sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is multifactorial and predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> can be challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) is known to affect vasoactive properties of vessels, but it has not been definitively correlated with SCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that pre-existing DM is independently and strongly correlated with SCV, despite intensive glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) admitted to a single academic medical center between January 2002 and January 2008 (n = 145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting greater than 14 days after ictus, as well as those not surviving the first 3 days post-ictus were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remaining patients (n = 113) were assessed for study parameters including pre-existing DM, mean daily blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and additional known correlates to SCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed to assess risk factors for SCV development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was SCV, defined as neurological change in conjunction with evidence of vessel spasm by either angiography or transcranial ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 113 patients included in the study, 42 (37%) had SCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with DM (80% incidence of SCV) had an increased risk of subsequently developing SCV (OR 9.90, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevated blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was not associated with increased risk of vasospasm and no difference in glycemic control was noted between patients with or without DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SCV resulted in worsened mortality and Glasgow Outcome Score for survivors (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this group of patients with SAH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is identified as a risk factor for development of SCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> management during hospitalization was similar in diabetics and non-diabetics, suggesting that the longstanding effects of microvascular disease may be more relevant in the development of SCV then <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> glycemic control in these patients </plain></SENT>
