<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in one week - 14 months after the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent MRT/CT of the brain, cerebral angiography (MRA, rarely - CTA or conventional angiography), duplex ultrasound and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, platelet aggregation, blood clotting, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase, prothrombin and factor V Leiden gene mutations were also studied along with routine clinical and biochemical blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When it was indicated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, DNA antibodies, antibodies to some viruses were studied and muscle biopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The causes of IS were as follows: cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> (25%), cardioembolism (12%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (11%), coagulography (7%), arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> cytopathy (3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> (1%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-moya disease</z:e> (0,5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery spasm</z:e> after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disruption (0,5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of IS remained unknown (cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) in 29% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period the diagnosis was not verified by angiography which was conducted only in the late stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3 months or more after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development) </plain></SENT>
