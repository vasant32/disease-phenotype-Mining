<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on precise clinical criteria (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between the 3rd and the 8th day after the SAH) and is confirmed by angiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology certainly involves many factors, though the identification of the primary cause (conductive to morpho-structural alterations of the artery walls) seems to be troublesome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence indicates that the basis of the reactions which cause the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the vasospasm lies in the blood which pools in the subarachnoid zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors summarize the main pathogenetic theories, especially as far as the initial biochemical sequence is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the numerous classes of substances involved in the genesis of vasospasms, a relevant role is played by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi>, free radicals, lipidic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxides</z:chebi> and by the metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of vasospasm treatment is the possibility to eliminate and prevent ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early surgical exclusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> causing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> allows for the removal of peri-aneurysmatic blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment employs numerous classes of substances: among these calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> presently appear to give satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
