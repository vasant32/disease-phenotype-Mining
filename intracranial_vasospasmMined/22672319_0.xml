<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin (EPO) may reduce the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and improve outcome, however, underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of EPO on cerebral metabolism and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven consecutive poor grade SAH patients with multimodal neuromonitoring (MM) received systemic EPO therapy (30.000 IU per day for 3 consecutive days) for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), PbtO2 and brain metabolic changes were analyzed during the next 24 hours after each dose given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with a mixed effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22 interventions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 47 years (32-68) and 86 % were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients (38 %) developed DCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAP decreased 2 hours after intervention (P &lt; 0.04) without significantly affecting CPP and ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PbtO2 significantly increased over time (P &lt; 0.05) to a maximum of 7 ± 4 mmHg increase 16 hours after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain metabolic parameters did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EPO increases PbtO2 in poor grade SAH patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect on outcome needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
