<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is experimental and clinical evidence of positive effects of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) donors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore analysed the effect of transdermal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> in patients with SAH measuring transcranial Doppler velocities (TCD), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">Nitroglycerin</z:chebi> was used in a target dose of 14 microg/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD assessment was performed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF measurements were done using the perfusion CT-technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, volume intake and vasopressor administration, were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were randomly assigned either to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> group (N-group) and eight patients in the control group (C-group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean TCD values in the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were lower in the N-group (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean TCD in the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) showed no difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Lindegaard ratio was higher in the N-group (p&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CBF in the N-group was higher than in the C-group (p&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even though <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> reduces blood pressure and lowers ICA TCD-values and increases the Lindegaard ratio, a higher CBF was measured in the N-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> influences the cerebral vascular tone and increases CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SAH therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> is possible without increasing the risk of DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The exact timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, duration and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> administration in respect to the appearance of vasospasm may have a strong impact on the success of such a therapy </plain></SENT>
