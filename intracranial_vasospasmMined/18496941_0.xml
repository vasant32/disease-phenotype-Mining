<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of such patients, epidemiological data, clinical information, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> characteristics (of both unruptured and ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the same patients) were gathered in this retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients operated on for multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, between 1994 and 2003 were assessed, 90% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), 10% with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The female to male ratio was 3:1, median age was 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (74%), decrease of consciousness (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (40%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological signs were meningism (40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve paresis</z:hpo> (12%), none (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was the major complaint (40%) in patients with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 20% had <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of extraocular muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>History of smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 47% and 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 265 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (median number per patient, 2; range, 2-8), 95% were small (&lt; or = 10 mm), 4.5% large, 0.5% giant (&gt; 25 mm); 34% were ruptured, 66% unruptured (median size, 7 mm vs. 4 mm; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (27%) were on the middle cerebral artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (18%) were on the anterior communicating artery and were 10 mm or smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of patients had (non-surgery related) SAH complications: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (44%), post-SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (36%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (36%), intracerebral (25%) and intraventricular (21%) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 3 months was 4 or 5 in 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were significantly larger than unruptured ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although discussed controversially, most of our population's ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were 10mm or smaller in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Considering this, our study may contribute to improve the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
