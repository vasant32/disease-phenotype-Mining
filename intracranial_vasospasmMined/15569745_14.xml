<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angioplasty and intra-arterial papaverine are promising treatments for severe symptomatic vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), but there is little information on the clinical factors that predict treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine variables for predicting functional outcome in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 81 consecutive patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> from aneurysmal SAH treated with percutaneous balloon angioplasty or selective intra-arterial papaverine infusion between 1990 and 2000 (105 procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of various clinical and angiographic factors on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean patient age was 54 years (range, 29-88 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (36%) presented with poor-grade (World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons [WFNS] grade IV or V) SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical deficits were global in 55 patients (70%), and angiographic vasospasm was diffuse in 53 (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment consisted of transluminal angioplasty alone (18 procedures, 17%), intra-arterial papaverine infusion (65 procedures, 62%), or both (22 procedures, 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unequivocal arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients, and major complications occurred in 2% of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (12%) died in the hospital, and 36 (44%) recovered poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Permanent deficits attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were present in 37 patients (52% of survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced age and poor WFNS grade at presentation were predictive of poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Advanced age and poor clinical status at the time of SAH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are predictive of poor clinical outcome despite endovascular treatment with angioplasty or intra-arterial papaverine in patients with symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
