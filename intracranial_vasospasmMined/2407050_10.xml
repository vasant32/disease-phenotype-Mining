<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients with a verified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> were studied in a double blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single centre to determine the value and relative risks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>) in the management of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of recurrent haemorrhage between active and placebo groups was identical (12%) and the mortality from recurrent haemorrhage was 7% and 5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> before surgery, at discharge and at 6 months follow-up was greater in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> group (27%) than in the control group (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was significantly more frequent in the active, 18 of 29 as compared to 6 of 32 patients, in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a fifth of the patients in whom cerebral blood flow was estimated there was a significant reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on the side of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this may be the cause of the increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, visual disturbances and gastrointestinal disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More fatalities were encountered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and recurrent haemorrhage in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> group but these differences did not reach statistical significance at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that disability was due to either vasospasm or recurrent haemorrhage than a patient under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> treatment was significantly more likely to have disability due to vasospasm (p less than 0.04); the reverse was true for the placebo patient (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
