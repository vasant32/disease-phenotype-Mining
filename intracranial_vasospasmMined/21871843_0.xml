<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This subject was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted on 24 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of them were used as the baseline control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH was applied to the 15 animals; the remaining five of them were used as a sham group injecting by the serum physiologic saline (PS) and followed up twenty days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stellate ganglion neuron densities were estimated stereologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm index (VSI) was used to assess the severity of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of VSI between 1 and 1.5 was accepted as no vasospasm, 1.5-2 was accepted as light vasospasm and 2 or greater than 2 was accepted as severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean basilar artery VSI in the control group (n: 4) was calculated as 1.24±0.39 and the neuron density of stellate ganglion was calculated as 8320±675/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These values in the PS group (n: 5) were calculated as 1.26±0.37 and 8380±680/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In animals with light basilar artery vasospasm (n: 6), the basilar artery VSI and neuron density of stellate ganglion were 1.65±0.37, 9210±460/mm(3) consecutively, but the basilar artery VSI was 2.07±0.40 and neuron density was 12,075±950/mm(3) in animals with severe vasospasm (n: 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuron density of stellate ganglion may play an important role in the development of basilar artery vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of sympathectomy for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be explained through this mechanism </plain></SENT>
