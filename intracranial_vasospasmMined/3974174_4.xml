<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients with focal deficits such as transitory ischemic attack (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological deficit</z:e> (PRIND), and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, and in eleven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the cerebral blood flow was measured by 133Xenon inhalation technique 60 min after oral administration of 40, 60, or 80 mg Nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients with vasospasm the effects of Nimodipine i.v. were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result in twelve patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were only given placebo (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi>; "test-retest") was identical regional (rCBF) and global (CBF) cerebral blood flow before and 60 min after; placebo, blood pressure, and arterial pCO2 remained constant as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After Nimodipine, however, the CBF increases, the increase after vasospasm being significant when taking the pCO2 in the Wilcoxon test into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF increases much more in the regions with low perfusion rates than in well-perfused areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is also observed in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, PRIND, or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, most clearly after oral administration of 60 mg, whereas regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion rates show little reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure was lowered, depending on the initial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
