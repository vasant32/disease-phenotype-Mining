<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the vasodilatory effect of intracisternal (i.c.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration of calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CGRP) on arterial narrowing after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one rabbits were divided into five groups: control (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals); SAH plus i.c. infusion of vehicle; SAH plus i.c. infusion of CGRP; SAH plus i.v. infusion of vehicle; SAH plus i.v. infusion of CGRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the control group, either CGRP (100 ng/kg/min) or vehicle solution was infused for two hours immediately prior to sacrifice by perfusion-fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A morphometric technique was employed to measure the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of rabbit basilar arteries two days after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar arteries in either the i.c. or i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CGRP groups was significantly greater than that of the respective vehicle group (i.c., p &lt; 0.001; i.v., p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in systemic arterial blood pressure after infusion between the i.c. vehicle and i.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CGRP groups, i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CGRP caused significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that exogenous CGRP has some therapeutic potential for arterial narrowing after SAH not only by intrathecal application, but also by systemic use </plain></SENT>
