<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean flow velocity of blood in the middle cerebral artery and the index of cerebral circulatory resistance as a measure of the peripheral vascular flow resistance were determined in 76 patients with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ICP was measured using an epidural transducer in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no case in which both high ICP and a high mean flow velocity were observed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The investigations led to the following conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1) In patients with a resistance index of less than 0.5, changes in the mean flow velocity seem to reflect sufficiently the actual severity and time course of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2) During the time course of vasospasm, an increase in the resistance index above values of 0.6 with a simultaneously decreased mean flow velocity indicates a rise in ICP rather than a reduction in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3) With a pronounced increase in ICP, evaluation of the severity and time course of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography based solely upon the mean flow velocity can lead to false-negative results </plain></SENT>
