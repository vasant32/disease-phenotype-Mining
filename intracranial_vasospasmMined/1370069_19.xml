<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was produced in adult mongrel dogs by a two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> method, and the spastic basilar arteries were exposed via the transclival route on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tonic contraction was produced in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> canine basilar arteries by a local application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> after transclival exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exposed spastic and tonic basilar arteries then received a topical application of the following: 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi> (H-7), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C acting at the catalytic domain; calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C acting at the regulatory domain; or calpeptin, a selective inhibitor of calpain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both spastic and tonic basilar arteries were effectively dilated by H-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calphostin C caused only slight dilation of spastic basilar arteries but moderate dilation of tonic basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dilation in response to calpeptin was remarkable in the spastic basilar arteries but slight in the tonic basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The doses of calphostin C and calpeptin required to obtain maximum effect were markedly lower in the tonic model than in the spastic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spastic and tonic models had a similar dose-dependent response to H-7 but quite a different response to calphostin C or calpeptin, suggesting a difference in the function of protein kinase C and calpain in the two models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of calphostin C on the reversal of vasospasm was increased significantly after topical treatment with calpeptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the majority of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C is dissociated from the regulatory domain, probably by a limited proteolysis with calpain, and is markedly activated in vasospasm </plain></SENT>
