<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that together with specific receptors, A (ETrA) and B (ETrB) is induced following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and has been closely linked to regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin receptor antagonists</z:chebi> have been shown to ameliorate early evidence of neuronal cell injury, activation of microglial cells, and hypoperfusion following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism involved in TBI-induced hypoperfusion is still unclear; however, it is thought that endothelin-1 engagement of ETrA is primarily responsible for changes in blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we question the role of the microvascular pericyte in endothelin-1-mediated pathophysiology in TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pericyte expression of endothelin-1, ETrA, and ETrB was examined in primary culture and in sham and impacted rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were also given intracerebroventricular injections of ETrA (BQ-123) before being subjected to TBI using a closed head acceleration impact model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary pericytes express both endothelin-1 and its receptors ETrA and ETrB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following TBI, the number of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive pericytes located in microvessels is significantly increased by 4â€…hours post-traumatic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in pericyte expression of alpha-SMA correlated with evidence of a reduction in both arteriolar and capillary diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Capillary endothelin-1, ETrA, and ETrB transcript and protein was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased endothelin-1 expression was seen by 2-4 hours post-impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of receptors was observed by 4-8 hours and maximum by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ETrA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> decreased the number of alpha-SMA(+) pericytes as well as changes in microvascular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003026'>decreased vasoconstriction</z:mp> following TBI may be due to an endothelin-1-induced pericyte-mediated regulation of microvessel blood flow following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, results suggest that ETrA <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> ameliorate trauma induced hypoperfusion, in part, by inhibiting endothelin-1-mediated upregulation of alpha-SMA in pericytes </plain></SENT>
