<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial measurements of middle cerebral velocities, using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, were performed in 34 patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and correlated with cerebral blood flow, measured in 20 of the 34 using single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> and neurological evidence of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 16 patients without delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, eight had evidence of vasospasm (greater than 120 cm/sec), but only one of seven had hypoperfusion, suggesting that vasospasm might be more common than hypoperfusion in this group (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and a lateralizing deficit, both asymmetrical middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (eight of nine with vasospasm) and hypoperfusion (six of six studied) were concordant with the clinically ischemic hemisphere (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm occurred with nonlateralized delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in seven of eight patients and with hypoperfusion in five of six, affecting the anterior cerebral territory in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concordant vasospasm and hypoperfusion were most often present in patients with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and lateralizing neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordant results reflect inherent limitations and the different levels of the circulation monitored by the two techniques </plain></SENT>
