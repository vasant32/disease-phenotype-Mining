<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report our experience with keyhole approaches as favorable treatments for various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> including multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the different locations of 105 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> harbored in 100 patients, different keyhole approaches were designed elaborately, among which a supraorbital keyhole approach was used in 91 cases, a pterional keyhole approach in 5 cases, a subtemporal keyhole approach in 3 cases, a retromastoid keyhole approach in 2 cases, and a unifrontal interhemispheric keyhole approach in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among those 105 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 99 were clipped successfully, including 4 that were resected after clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One mini-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was wrapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were trapped, including 1 VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 1 giant ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 1 giant PCoA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 2 giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> (P2-P3 segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 5 cases were treated in 1 surgical session, including 3 cases via unilateral approaches and 2 cases via bilateral approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no severe keyhole approach-related complications in this present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The keyhole approaches, based on improvements in diagnostic imaging, advanced surgical instruments, and microsurgical skills, are effective and ideal craniotomy techniques in the hands of experienced neurosurgeons for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, including multiple and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, in patients without diffuse SAH, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
