<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), cerebral blood vessels show structural changes consistent with the actions of vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured platelet-derived vascular growth factors (PDGFs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients after SAH and tested the effect of these factors on cerebral arteries in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF was sampled from 14 patients after SAH, 6 patients not suffering SAH, and 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ELISA was performed for PDGF-AB, transforming growth factor-beta1, and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mouse model was used to compare cerebral vascular cell proliferation and PDGF staining in SAH compared with sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human pial arteries were incubated for 7 days in vitro, 2 groups with human blood clot and 1 with and 1 without PDGF antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PDGF-AB concentrations in CSF from SAH patients were significantly higher than those from non-SAH patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, both during the first week after SAH and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_180'>fibroblast proliferation</z:mpath> was observed after SAH in the mouse model, and this cellular replication was observed in conjunction with PDGF protein at the sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In human pial arteries, localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> stimulated vessel wall proliferation, and proliferation was blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against PDGFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> are increased in the CSF of patients after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of cells in the vascular wall is associated with perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cellular proliferation and subsequent vessel wall thickening may contribute to the syndrome of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
