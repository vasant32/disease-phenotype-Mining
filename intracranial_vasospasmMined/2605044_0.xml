<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among 528 cases with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 10 cases (1.9%) developed hemorrhagic infarction following vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious relationship between the occurrence and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the neurological grade on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction occurred from day 9 to 25 (mean day 16) after aneurysmal rupture, and the major neurological symptoms were aggravation of consciousness level, which appeared in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the CT scans of the hemorrhagic infarction following vasospasm, nine cases revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> as assembled of spotty or linear <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> within the ischemic infarction, and 5 cases had massive hemorrhagic infarction in size with mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although surgical therapy for 2 cases and conservative therapy for 8 cases were performed, the results were unfavorable; ie, 2 cases were good, 5 fair or poor, and 3 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially, 5 cases with massive hemorrhagic infarction obviously resulted in poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> therapy for vasospasm was considered as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is necessary to avoid induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> therapy in the remission stage of vasospasm and serial SPECT study might be recommended as a useful prospective method estimating the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
