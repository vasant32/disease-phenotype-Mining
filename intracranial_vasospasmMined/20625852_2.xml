<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical trainees regularly encounter critical care situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, education was accomplished through lecture and experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasingly, human patient simulators (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>) are employed, allowing trainees to sharpen skills in a safe and realistic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> in neurosurgical training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a critical care training program for residents and medical students using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a hi-fidelity, lifelike Human Patient Simulator™ (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>™) produced by Medical Education Technologies, Inc.™ to simulate realistic scenarios for trainee education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Topics included spinal shock, closed head injury, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A three-way evaluation model was employed to test validity, including pre- and post-exercise testing, survey feedback, and videotaped replay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simulation exercises were conducted by a neuro-critical care attending, a senior neurosurgical resident, and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> technician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We currently have 29 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On a 20-point critical care multiple-choice exam for these participants, average improvement has been 4.5 points or 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, average improvement was 4.75 points (24%) amongst neurosurgery residents, 3.07 points (18%) amongst neurology residents, 7 points (38%) amongst general surgery residents, and 7 points (38%) amongst senior medical students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-exercise evaluations were overwhelmingly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical critical care education is important for safe and effective care for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical experience and didactic lectures help trainees obtain a solid knowledge base, but do not provide the benefit for learning in a fail-safe environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Through the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>, we have enhanced the critical care education of our trainees </plain></SENT>
