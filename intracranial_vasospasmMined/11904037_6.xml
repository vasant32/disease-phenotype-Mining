<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> endothelin-1 (ET-1) produces narrowing of cerebral arteries and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, regarding the physiological consequences of prolonged exposure of arterial wall to ET-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 30 rats, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline or 10(-8) mol/h of ET-1 was continuously applied for 3 or 5 days to the adventitial surface of the femoral artery in a Silastic cuff via an osmotic infusion pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessels were examined for histopathological changes and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing during ET-1 infusion (3 or 5 d) or at intervals from 2 to 9 days after infusion was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked arterial constriction (30-40% arterial diameter reduction) was present during continuous ET-1 infusion for 3 or 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both 3- and 5-day ET-1 infusions, significant reduction in arterial cross sectional area persisted up to 4 days after cessation of infusion, after which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> caliber returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arteries with persistent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing after cessation of ET-1 infusion, light microscopic findings revealed morphological changes in the vessel wall similar to those observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, with apparent increased collagen deposition in media and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous infusion of ET-1 produces reversible arterial narrowing that persists beyond the usual interval of physiological effect for this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged arterial constriction may produce physiological changes in arterial wall that act to maintain a narrowed lumen </plain></SENT>
