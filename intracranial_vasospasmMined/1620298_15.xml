<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with severe SAH who were admitted between February and July 1990 and who underwent surgery within 48 hours of the initial aneurysmal rupture were treated with an intravenous administration of FUT-175 soon after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided randomly into three groups, each receiving a different dose of FUT-175 (Group A, 20 mg every 12 hours for 4 days; Group B, 20 mg every 6 hours for 4 days, Group C, 40 mg every 6 hours for 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with another group of twenty-two patients with severe SAH who were admitted before February 1990 and received equivalent treatment, except they were not treated with FUT-175 </plain></SENT>
