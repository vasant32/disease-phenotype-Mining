<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in cerebral circulation, we undertook the present study to examine the action of NPY itself, and the combined effects of NPY with other vasoconstrictor stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NPY itself produced contractions of isolated canine basilar artery in a concentration-dependent manner, which was independent of the presence or absence of endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of NPY (NPY12-36) and (NPY22-36) were weak <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, while those without C-terminals were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction produced by NPY was, however, strongly potentiated by increasing the K+ concentration in the medium up to 20 mM, or by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi>, a K+ channel blocker and hemolysate containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NPY also augmented the contractile responses to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2 alpha, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, but not to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contraction in response to NPY per se or in 20 mM K+ was effectively attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> such as d-cis-diltiazem, and in a Ca(2+)-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in canine basilar artery, the activation of the Y1 receptor modulates the availability of the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel, leading to enhance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx from the extracellular space and potentiate contractile effects of other cerebral vasoconstrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This might be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> which occurs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
