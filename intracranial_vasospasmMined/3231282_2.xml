<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 113 were treated with Nimodipine, a predominantly cerebrovaskular-active substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative condition according to Hunt and Hess (9), the locations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and the ages of the two groups of patients were directly comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was however higher in the Nimodipine group (49%) than in the control group (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively we analyzed the progress of the patients as to their neurological, intellectual, and social function for up to five years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality and morbidity in the Nimodipine group amounted to 10% and 7% respectively, in the group without Nimodipine 20% and 17% respectively (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the Nimodipine patients, 72% showed excellent neurological outcome, with 73% intellectually, and 72% completely resocialized, as compared to 53% in the control group with an excellent neurological outcome, 39% intellectually intact (p less than 0.0001, and 52% completely resocialized (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Nimodipine not only increases cerebral blood flow, but also protects brain tissue from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
