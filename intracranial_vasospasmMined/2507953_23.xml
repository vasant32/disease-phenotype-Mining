<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) derived from recombinant deoxyribonucleic (DNA) technology has been introduced as a new thrombolytic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With its high affinity for fibrin-bound plasminogen and low affinity for circulating plasminogen by which a clot-selective fibrinolysis can be achieved without the danger of inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic fibrinogenolysis</z:e>, rtPA might be the ideal substance for the postoperative lysis of cisternal blood accumulations after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of rtPA in preventing delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> using a single intracisternal bolus injection of this agent was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a single injection of 25 micrograms of rtPA into the cisterna magna 48 hours after the first and 6 hours after the second injection of blood in the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, angiographic spasm of the basilar artery was completely prevented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals so treated whereas in the control group severe vasospasm occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy studies of the experimental animals demonstrated that the subarachnoid blood clots were almost completely removed by intracisternal rtPA application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally the pathomorphological signs of proliferative vasculopathy present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals of the control group were not demonstrable in the rtPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As intracisternal bolus injection of rtPA is highly efficacious in preventing angiographic as well as pathomorphological vasospasm, it is concluded that use of this thrombolytic substance might be a promising approach for pharmacological blood clot removal </plain></SENT>
