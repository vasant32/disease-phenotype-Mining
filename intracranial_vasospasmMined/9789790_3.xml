<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is inhibited by <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>-BQ-123; this protects the neurons from ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the dynamics of ET-1 concentration changes in the plasma of rats in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of vasospasm after SAH, which was induced by administering 100 microliters non-heparinized fresh autologous arterial blood into the brain cisterna magna (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study also assesses the effect of blocking <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors on the changes in ET-1 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BQ-123, the specific <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was administered to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a cannula inserted into CM; the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>--40 nmol in 50 microliters CSF--was given 20 minutes prior to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, sham SAH was induced by administering 100 microliters artificial CSF (aCSF) to CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1 concentration in the plasma of rats in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of vasospasm was assessed by radioimmunoassay 30 and 60 minutes after SAH or sham SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has been showed that both SAH and sham SAH cause significant increase in the ET-1 concentration (p &lt; 0.05) in the rat plasma after 30 minutes; the concentration returns to an initial value after following 30 minutes, which may suggest that ET-1 released binds to its receptors in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the two groups of rats with blocked <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors there was a significant rise in ET-1 concentration 30 minutes after SAH or sham SAH, and a still further rise was observed 60 minutes after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rise was significantly higher in animals with SAH (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of the ET-1 concentration changes observed in rats with blocked <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptor suggests that SAH is an ET-1 production stimulator significantly more potent than other factors assessed in the study, such as a rise in the intracranial pressure resulting from administering aCSF to CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blocking <z:chebi fb="209" ids="16000,53460">ETA</z:chebi> receptors makes it impossible for the ET-1 released to bind to the receptors, which may be a factor preventing the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
