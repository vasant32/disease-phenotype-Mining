<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilator</z:chebi> KMUP-3 (7-[2-[4-(4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27798">nitrobenzene</z:chebi>)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23818">dimethylxanthine</z:chebi>) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e>, neurological outcome, and expression of rhoA/rho kinase II (ROCKII), rhoA, and protein kinase C (PKC) γ proteins were evaluated in a rat model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAH was induced by double injection of autologous blood into the cistern magna on days 0 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KMUP-3 was administered (0.3 mg/kg/day) by osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously (beginning day -3 in pretreatment group and at 1 h after the initiation of the first autologous blood injection in the treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was assessed by ambulation and placing/stepping reflex responses at 48 h after the second injection of autologous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and protein expression were conducted on day 7 post-day 0 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both KMUP-3 treatment regimens significantly improved neurological outcome and completely attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery narrowing</z:e> as well as reduced the enhancement of ROCKII, rhoA, and PKCγ protein expression in rats subjected to SAH, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and untreated SAH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that KMUP-3 may be a novel agent for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following SAH </plain></SENT>
