<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No marker that reflects and predicts brain injury due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that membrane-bound tissue factor (mTF) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH become markers indicating brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the hypothesis, we correlated levels of mTF and TAT in the CSF of patients with SAH with clinical severity, the degree of SAH, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assayed CSF mTF, TAT and myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with SAH at intervals that included days 0 to 4 and days 5 to 9 after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classification of clinical severity of disease on admission was based on Hunt and Hess grade, degree of SAH on CT on Fisher's grading, and outcome 3 months after SAH on the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the interval from days 0 to 4, mTF and TAT correlated with Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades, and occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only mTF correlated significantly in this period with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TAT, mTF, and MBP <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> correlated significantly with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From days 5 to 9, only mTF correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, infarction volume, MBP levels, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both mTF and TAT reflected brain injury from SAH and predicted vasospasm, though mTF was more sensitive and a better predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike mTF, TAT did not correlate with vasospasm during the interval when it most commonly occurs, which raised doubt about thrombin activation as a cause </plain></SENT>
