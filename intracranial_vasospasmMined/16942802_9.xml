<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of vasospasm is frequently used in canine and rat models, most studies with rabbits only use the one-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we accomplished a side-by-side comparison between one- and two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> models in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 rabbits were randomly divided into three groups, i.e. control group (n = 5), one (n = 15)- and two (n = 18)-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, the clinical behavior, and the residual amount of subarachnoid blood clots were measured on days 3, 5 and 7 after the establishment of the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with one-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, the time course of vasospasm in the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model was more coincident with that observed in humans, produced more severe vasospasm after SAH, and had an acceptable low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the two-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model in rabbits is more appropriate than the one-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model for the research on SAH or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, and thus can be used for the investigation of the mechanisms of and therapeutic approaches for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
