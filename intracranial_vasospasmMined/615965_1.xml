<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial smooth muscle contraction, receptor and relaxation mechanisms are presented in the context of what is known about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> and the biochemistry of vascular smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several new experimental approaches are suggested and a theoretical biochemical basis for the idea that damage to the artery alone could cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> is postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods of determining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> and the need for a quantitative, in vivo method are discussed and the question of an irreversible stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral arterial spasm</z:e> is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the problems associated with the delivery of a potentially successful treatment to the cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells are examined </plain></SENT>
