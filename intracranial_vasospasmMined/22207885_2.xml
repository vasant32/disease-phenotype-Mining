<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence supporting the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in early brain injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are released by inflammatory cells and can mediate early brain injury via disruption of the extracellular matrix and mediate vasospasm by cleaving endothelin-1 into vasoactive fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> marked by neutrophil elevation and MMP-9 release in human SAH is associated with vasospasm and with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled consecutive SAH subjects (N = 55), banked serial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, and evaluated their 3-month modified Rankin scores (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was defined as &gt;50% vessel caliber reduction on angiography 6-8 days post-SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A poor outcome was defined as mRS &gt; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared blood leukocyte and neutrophil counts during post-SAH days 0-14 with respect to vasospasm and 3-month outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subset of SAH subjects (N = 35), we compared blood and CSF MMP-9 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on post-SAH days 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-8, and 10-14 with respect to vasospasm and to 3-month outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent elevation of blood leukocyte (p = 0.0003) and neutrophil (p = 0.0002) counts during post-SAH days 0-14 are independently associated with vasospasm after adjustment for major confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the same time period, blood neutrophil count (post-SAH days 2-3, p = 0.018), blood MMP-9 (post-SAH days 4-5, p = 0.045), and CSF MMP-9 (post-SAH days 2-3, p = 0.05) are associated with poor 3-month SAH clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil count correlates with blood MMP-9 (post-SAH days 6-8, R = 0.39; p = 0.055; post-SAH days 10-14, R = 0.79; p &lt; 0.0001), and blood MMP-9 correlates with CSF MMP-9 (post-SAH days 4-5, R = 0.72; p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevation of CSF MMP-9 during post-SAH days 0-14 is associated with poor 3-month outcome (p = 0.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither CSF nor blood MMP-9 correlates with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early rise in blood neutrophil count and blood and CSF MMP-9 are associated with poor 3-month SAH clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In blood, neutrophil count correlates with MMP-9 levels, suggesting that neutrophils may be an important source of blood MMP-9 early in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CSF and blood MMP-9 correlate positively early in the course of SAH, suggesting that blood may be an important source of CSF MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Blood and CSF MMP-9 are associated with clinical outcome but not with vasospasm, suggesting that MMP-9 may mediate brain injury independent of vasospasm in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Future in vitro studies are needed to investigate the role of MMP-9 in SAH-related brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Larger clinical studies are needed to validate blood and CSF MMP-9 as potential biomarkers for SAH outcome </plain></SENT>
