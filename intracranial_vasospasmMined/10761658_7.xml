<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the preventive effect of UV light on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> by using a rabbit common carotid artery (CCA) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit CCAs were constricted for a long period by application of autologous blood within a silicon sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before immersion in blood, the CCAs were adventitiously exposed to UV light emitted from a <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> laser (wavelength 325 nm) yielding an irradiation energy of 10 mJ/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of vasospasm was evaluated using angiography 48 hours after blood exposure in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The UV light treatment significantly reduced the degree of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters measured on Day 0, prior to treatment, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters of UV light-treated arteries (six animals) decreased by only 6%, whereas that of the sham-treated arteries (eight animals) significantly decreased by 26% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of UV light-treated CCAs revealed no endothelial damage and extended smooth-muscle cells, in which some fragmented nuclei were confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight days after blood exposure, examination of UV light-treated CCAs revealed only myointimal proliferation, similar to that of the sham-treated CCAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to provide evidence of a prophylactic effect of UV light on vasospasm and are suggestive of involvement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the mechanism of this effect </plain></SENT>
