<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the prevention study, rabbits were injected with 3 ml of autologous blood in the cisterna magna and treatment with CGS 26303 i.v. was initiated 1 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The compound was subsequently administered at 12, 24, and 36 h post SAH and animals were sacrificed at 48 h post SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS 26303 at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg resulted in dose-dependent increases in the concentrations of the compound in cerebrospinal fluid samples, and the arterial narrowing after SAH was significantly attenuated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina of vessels was often observed in the vehicle-treated group, but it was not prominent in the CGS 26303-treated groups and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the reversal study, treatment with CGS 26303 was initiated 24 h post SAH and a second injection was given 12 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing was significantly attenuated in rabbits treated with CGS 26303 at 30 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that CGS 26303 may be an effective agent in prevention and reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
