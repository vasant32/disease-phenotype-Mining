<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats received an intracisternal injection of blood (0.4 ml) on day 0 and a second injection 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was sequentially measured using laser-Doppler flowmetry, and the diameters of the cerebral arteries were determined after filling the cerebral vasculature with a casting compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF fell to 67% of control after the first intracisternal injection of blood but returned to a value near control 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF again fell to 63% of control after a second intracisternal injection of blood and remained 30% below control for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fall in CBF after the second intracisternal injection of blood was associated with a sustained 30% reduction in the diameters of the middle cerebral, posterior communicating, and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the rats develop delayed vasospasm after induction of the dual-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model of SAH and that blockade of the synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34306">20-HETE</z:chebi> fully reverses <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in this model </plain></SENT>
