<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective: To characterize and establish a reproducible model that demonstrates delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in rats, in order to identify the initiating events, pathophysiological changes and potential targets for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 - 300 g) were arbitrarily assigned to one of two groups - SAH or saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the SAH group (n=15) was induced by double injection of autologous blood, 48 hr apart, into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (n=13) was injected into the cisterna magna of the saline control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed on day five after the second blood injection and the brains were preserved for histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of vasospasm was measured using sections of the basilar artery, by measuring the internal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross sectional area using NIH Image-J software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significance was tested using Tukey/Kramer's statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: After analysis of histological sections, basilar artery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cross sectional area were smaller in the SAH than in the saline group, consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the former group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SAH group, basilar artery internal area (.056 μm ± 3) were significantly smaller from vasospasm five days after the second blood injection (seven days after the initial blood injection), compared to the saline control group with internal area (.069 ± 3; p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no mortalities from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The rat double SAH model induces a mild, survivable, basilar artery vasospasm that can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a small animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A low and acceptable mortality rate is a significant criterion to be satisfied for an ideal SAH animal model so that the mechanisms of vasospasm can be elucidated (7, 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further modifications of the model can be made to adjust for increased severity of vasospasm and neurological exams </plain></SENT>
