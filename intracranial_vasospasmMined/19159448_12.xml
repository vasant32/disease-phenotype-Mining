<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hydroxymethylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase inhibitors, also known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, has the neuroprotective effects and ameliorating CVS after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to explore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibiting effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and its potential apoptotic signal pathway after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preserving blood-brain-barrier permeability, decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, increasing neurological scores and ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were obtained after prophylactic use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were reduced markedly both in basilar artery and in brain cortex by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins P53, AIF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">Cytochrome</z:chebi> C were up-regulated after SAH, while they were not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 after SAH was decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment both in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and in protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> after SAH may be related to its inhibition of caspase-dependent proapoptotic pathway based on the present results </plain></SENT>
