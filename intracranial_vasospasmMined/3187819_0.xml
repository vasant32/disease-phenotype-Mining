<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of vasospasm showed accompanying delays in central conduction time, quantified by somatosensory evoked potential measurements, but nimodipine infusion markedly improved neurological status and level of consciousness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases within 10-60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conduction time was simultaneously reduced on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No focal deficits developed during therapy (mean 7.1 days) with nimodipine, which also appears to be effective in relieving existing vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evoked potentials provided a noninvasive quantitative parameter that correlated well with vasospastically induced clinical signs </plain></SENT>
