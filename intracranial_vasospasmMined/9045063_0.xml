<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the control group comprised 100 patients in whom angiography revealed no vasospasm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examination was initially conducted without and subsequently with the administration of contrast medium in a 2 mm thick layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount and distribution of blood were evaluated according to Fisher scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up cerebral angiography was performed in most cases in the second week after haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the studied group the occurrence of blood in the subarachnoid space was disclosed in 71 (71%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases it was present as clots in basal cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group the presence of blood was found in 32 (32%) of patients, this being usually diffused in subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results obtained, as well as those quoted from other works, confirm the usefulness of computerized tomography in prognosing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasms</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
