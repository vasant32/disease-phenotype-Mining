<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was significantly reduced and the constriction was significantly enhanced by endothelial removal with saponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potentiated constriction was significantly blocked by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> due to these neuropeptides may depend on endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and that the augmented constriction after endothelial removal may be related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> production in cerebral arterial smooth muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mechanism following the damage of endothelium might be implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
