<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed following the rCBF study and the degree of vasospasm was measured on the angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were graded clinically according to the system of Hunt and Hess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral vasospasm</z:e> significantly influenced rCBF: global reductions and focal changes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, hyperemia, and tissue peaks) were commonly associated with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe diffuse spasm always had global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (21 +/- 5 ml/100 gm/min), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> were demonstrated subsequently, The CMRO2 was more reduced than rCBF, indicating an uncoupling between flow and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This relative luxury perfusion was associated with CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arteriovenous difference of oxygen was equally reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of patients, probably due to the primary insult of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CMRO2 decreased concomitantly with arterial caliber, indicating a secondary impairment of cerebral metabolism due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
