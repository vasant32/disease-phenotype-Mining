<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 23 vascular territories were successfully treated in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three patients balloon angioplasty was performed before the papaverine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous monitoring of jugular bulb vein oxygen saturation with a fiberoptic catheter and blood sampling allowed the assessment of the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant and rapid improvement in jugular bulb oxygen saturation was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with critical values reflecting an improvement in cerebral oxygenation after endovascular treatment of vasospasm (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> concentration in the jugular bulb normalized within 4 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had evidence of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> before superselective intraarterial infusion of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of abnormal metabolic and oxygenation patterns were observed in one case in which an optimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hypervolemic therapy could not be achieved after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in cerebral oxygenation as well as prevention of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> can be successfully achieved after intraarterial infusion of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Normalization of the oxygen supply after endovascular treatment has to be supported by optimal and well-monitored <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hypervolemic hemodilution </plain></SENT>
