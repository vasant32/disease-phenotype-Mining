<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current vasospasm therapies are suboptimal; new therapies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clazosentan, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51451">endothelin receptor antagonist</z:chebi>, has shown promise in phase 2 studies, and two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (CONSCIOUS-2 and CONSCIOUS-3) are underway to further investigate its impact on vasospasm-related outcome after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the design of these studies, which was challenging with respect to defining endpoints and standardizing endpoint interpretation and patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main inclusion criteria are: age 18-75 years; SAH due to ruptured saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> secured by surgical clipping (CONSCIOUS-2) or endovascular coiling (CONSCIOUS-3); substantial subarachnoid clot; and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades I-IV prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-securing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CONSCIOUS-2, patients are randomized 2:1 to clazosentan (5 mg/h) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CONSCIOUS-3, patients are randomized 1:1:1 to clazosentan 5, 15 mg/h, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment is initiated within 56 h of aSAH and continued until 14 days after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint is a composite of mortality and vasospasm-related morbidity within 6 weeks of aSAH (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, vasospasm-related new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficit, neurological signs or symptoms in the presence of angiographic vasospasm leading to rescue therapy initiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Main secondary endpoint is extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A critical events committee assesses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data centrally to ensure consistency in interpretation, and patient management guidelines are used to standardize care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results are expected at the end of 2010 and 2011 for CONSCIOUS-2 and CONSCIOUS-3, respectively </plain></SENT>
