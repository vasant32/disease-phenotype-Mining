<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of continuous cisternal drainage on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was studied under strict criteria in 140 patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) on the computed tomography scan was graded from I to IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to the total amount of cisternal drainage into three groups, regardless of the duration of the drainage and whether or not it was accompanied by irrigation; i.e., those with less than 500 mL (group 1: 57 cases), those with 500-3000 mL (group 2: 44 cases), and those with 3000-9500 mL (group 3: 39 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While correlations could be found between both clinical and SAH grades with the severity of vasospasm, closer correlation could be found in the SAH grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In analyzing the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> grades III-IV (severe clots), the angiographic vasospasm was less severe in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1, and the incidences of permanent symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography were lower in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the surgical outcome in cases with SAH grades III-IV, the mortality rate was lower in groups 2 and 3 (22% and 19%) than in group 1 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the rate of good recovery was higher in groups 2 and 3 (61% and 57%) than in group 1 (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences between groups 2 and 3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> or in surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a shortcoming of continuous cisternal drainage, the need for shunt operation was higher in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1 </plain></SENT>
