<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD137 is recognized as an independent costimulatory molecule of T cells and activator of monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence indicates that CD137 is vital for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the expression of CD137 in the basilar artery in a rat SAH model and to clarify the potential role of CD137 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 107 rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group; day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals in SAH groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were sacrificed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the CD137 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of basilar artery was found to be 57,944±5581μm(2) in control group, 26,100±2639μm(2) in day 3, 19,723±2412μm(2) in day 5, and 28,800±2980μm(2) in day 7 group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein of CD137 were detected after SAH and peaked on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD137 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in a rat experimental model of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the possible role of CD137 in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after SAH </plain></SENT>
