<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research has shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> oxidation products (BOXes) are present in the cerebral spinal fluid in patients with SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and can contribute to vasoconstriction and vasospasm in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> are not understood; however, one component of the occlusion may be due to vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors have investigated the actions of BOXes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> ([<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>], a phosphatase inhibitor), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12 myristate-13 acetate ([<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>], a protein kinase activator) on vascular smooth-muscle cell (VSMC) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to assess VSMC <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and alpha-smooth-muscle actin (alphaSMA) distribution following the application of BOXes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release and oxidative metabolism were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BOXes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> caused VSMCs to change their shape and exhibit altered alphaSMA distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These treatments increased LDH release (p &lt; 0.05), which is an index of increased cell stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oxidative metabolism significantly increased at low and high doses of BOXes, that is, 143 +/- 8.5% and 180 +/- 11.8%, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> also caused a significant increase in metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that BOXes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> alter VSMC <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and metabolic activity, events that have been observed during vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism remains unclear, the results indicate that BOXes may play a role in the vascular remodeling that occurs following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
