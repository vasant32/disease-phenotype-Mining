<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms were performed on 22 rabbits pre-SAH and 72 h post-SAH: 6 rabbits received an injection of mock cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml/kg) into the cisterna magna (group I, the control group); 6 rabbits were subjected to SAH but received no treatment (group II); autologous blood (1 ml/kg) from the central ear artery was injected into the cisterna magna of these rabbits; 6 rabbits were subjected to SAH (1 ml/kg) and treated with intraperitoneal (IP) bolus injections of remacemide <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) every 12 h beginning 30 minutes after SAH (group III); and 4 rabbits were not subjected to SAH but received IP bolus injections of remacemide <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> every 12 h (group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography was used to measure the diameter of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 72 h post-SAH, vasospasm was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the basilar artery was reduced significantly below pre-SAH levels by 35.3 +/- 5.8% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with remacemide <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> significantly ameliorated vasospasm (27.3 +/- 5.4%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in this model EAAs may cooperate in the genesis of SAH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor antagonism with remacemide <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> can partially prevent the SAH-induced vasospasm of a large cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
