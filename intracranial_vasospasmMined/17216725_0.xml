<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three relatively young patients, men aged 29 and 38 years and a woman aged 40 years, developed ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> shortly after cocaine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three had used cigarettes or alcohol as well, and suffered from neurologic deficits with CT and MRI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They recovered, but neurologic sequelae remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cocaine may induce haemorrhagic as well as ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different vascular complications of cocaine may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic mechanisms of cocaine-induced ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include vasoconstriction due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular spasms</z:e> and serotoninergic action, and enhanced thrombocyte aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the last years, the use of cocaine is rising, so that the number of cocaine-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients can be expected to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use as a cause of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is important to recognise because discontinuation of cocaine can prevent a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
