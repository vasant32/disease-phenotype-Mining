<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past year we have observed six patients where spasm in the major vessels of the posterior circulation was primarily or in part responsible for the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such cases, the neurological examination may suggest a supratentorial mass with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and, in three of our cases, burr holes or carotid angiography were performed first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in every instance neurological signs present on admission indicated primary brain-stem dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each of the six cases vertebral angiography demonstrated significant spasm in either the vertebral or basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was monitored in each of the six patients and did not exceed 25 mm Hg in any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of head injury where the neurological examination indicates brain-stem dysfunction inconsistent with or after a supratentorial mass has been excluded, vertebral angiography may aid in the diagnosis and subsequent management of such patients </plain></SENT>
