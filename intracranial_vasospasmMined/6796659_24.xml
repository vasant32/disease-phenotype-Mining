<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thin-layer radiochromatography revealed that, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> canine basilar arteries, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> was transformed mainly to 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG)F1 alpha, a spontaneous metabolite of prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>, only a small amount of PGF2 alpha was detected, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>PGD2</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteries removed on Days 3 and 8 after subarachnoid blood injection showed a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis profile similar to that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi>-buffered saline (0.1M <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi> buffer, pH 9.0/0.15M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> = 1:9, vol/vol), canine basilar artery produced a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-like substance that inhibited <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>)-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin likewise inhibited production of the anti-aggregatory substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, it was concluded that the anti-aggregatory activity was due solely to the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> by the arterial specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the above results, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> biosynthetic activity in the cerebral artery exposed to subarachnoid blood injection was bioassayed by measuring the inhibitory activity of the incubation product upon <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation following incubation of the arteries in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi>-buffered saline for 5 to 30 minutes at 20 degrees C, using synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>-Na as a standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The synthetic activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> in the artery exposed to subarachnoid blood injection had diminished remarkably by Days 3 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This diminution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> synthesis in the cerebral artery may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
