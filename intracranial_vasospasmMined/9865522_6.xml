<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (OxyHb) is implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, we have investigated the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in OxyHb-mediated signalling in canine cerebral arteries and cultured canine cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OxyHb produced a contraction of basilar artery preparations, which was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, and PD098059, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, OxyHb induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 42, 46, 54-60 and 80-100 kDa proteins with a time-course which paralleled the contractile action of OxyHb, suggesting that these events might be functionally linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 42 and 60 kDa proteins were immunologically related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK2), and to p60c-Src (c-Src), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi>, and the phosphorylation of the 42 kDa protein (ERK2) was inhibited by PD098059 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that OxyHb-mediated signalling utilizes a protein tyrosine kinase-based mechanism </plain></SENT>
