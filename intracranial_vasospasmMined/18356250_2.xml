<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (aSAH) can be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> global and regional decrease in cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may lead to development of delayed ischaemic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to find out whether cerebral perfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, an indicator of cerebral microvascular function and autoregulation, measured by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET), is able to predict the long-term clinical outcome of aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The perfusion SPET data of 55 patients with aSAH were analysed by dividing the brain into 384 regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spatial perfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was assessed by calculating the relative dispersions (RD, coefficient of variation) from the SPETs performed before treatment (RD1) and 1 week after early surgical or endovascular treatment of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (RD2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both RDs were compared to the clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOS), neuropsychological test scores and late ischaemic findings in MRI 1 year after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High RD2 (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.18-3.26; p = 0.009) and poor clinical condition (Hunt and Hess grade) on admission (OR 6.60; 95% CI 1.78-24.52; p = 0.005) proved to be independent predictors of poor or moderate clinical outcome (GOS 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RD2 was higher in patients with ischaemic findings in 12-month MRI than in those without ischaemic findings (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RD2 also correlated with neuropsychological outcome 1 year after aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is an independent predictor of the clinical outcome of aSAH and may thus be a valuable measure in the assessment of the disease </plain></SENT>
