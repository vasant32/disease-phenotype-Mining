<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the time course of cerebral hemodynamics and outcome in patients with and without angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS), angiography, and MRI studies were performed to measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics and assess complications following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen aneurysmal SAH patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> occurred in 14 patients (77.8%), 5 of whom (35.7%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow velocity (V(mean) ) of the middle cerebral artery increased significantly as compared with healthy volunteers from day 1 to day 15, and substantially decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The V(mean) of middle cerebral artery was significantly higher in patients with than in patients without angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> from day 3 to day 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to angiography, TCCS detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> with 85.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 66.7% negative predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI-evidenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> occurred in nine patients (50%), three of whom (33.3%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that approximately one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase aneurysmal SAH patients have asymptomatic delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, which was undetected by TCCS in one-third of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may explain why the accuracy of TCCS to predict clinical symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
