<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients survived long enough to develop delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The computerized tomograms and angiograms were correlated with the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> may be preceded by relative vasodilation, or at least inhibition of vasocontraction, and concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> of the parent vessels diagnosed by contrast enhanced computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, if confirmed in larger series of patients, may allow prediction of that patient destined for vasospasm and may suggest some of the pathophysiology of this devastating problem </plain></SENT>
