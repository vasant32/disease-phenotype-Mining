<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether cerebral arteries in spasm have an altered capacity to synthesize the vasoactive substances prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>, we measured levels of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites using a primate model of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cynomolgus monkeys were assigned at random to one of three groups designated sham, clot, or clot-removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent base line cerebral angiography and bilateral dissection of the major cerebral arteries from the arachnoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clot and clot-removal groups had autologous <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> placed around the vessels to simulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sham group had a similar volume of saline instilled into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the clot-removal group underwent a second craniotomy to remove the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the initial operation, angiography was repeated on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The animals were then killed, and the cerebral arteries were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal levels of prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> in the cerebral vessels were measured after incubation in vitro by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No detectable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> release by these arteries was measurable using radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in the clot group, but not in the clot-removal or sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences among the groups in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> release, but prostacyclin levels were significantly lower in the clot group than in the clot-removal group (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It thus seems that, if an imbalance in constrictor and dilator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> occurs in association with vasospasm, this is more likely to arise from a relative lack of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> component prostacyclin than from a surplus of the vasoconstrictor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
