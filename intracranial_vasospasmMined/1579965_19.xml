<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased transcranial Doppler velocities and regional cerebral perfusion defects have been well demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, but the clinical significance of these changes has not been clearly defined, particularly in the presymptomatic stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have tested the hypothesis that a rapid, massive rise in Doppler velocity denotes progressive vasospasm by relating Doppler velocity increases to regional cerebral blood flow changes and to the subsequent clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial transcranial Doppler sonography was performed in 121 patients; 20 of these patients were selected for blood flow mapping on the basis of rapid increases (greater than 50 cm/sec/24 hr) in blood flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was mapped by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of 15 patients studied before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of any deficit subsequently developed a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 of these 15 patients, and in a further five in which single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was performed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a delayed neurological deficit, perfusion patterns were abnormal and correlated with sites of increased Doppler velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had zones of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> but did not develop neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler measurements can assist in identifying patients at risk of delayed ischemic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selection of patients for regional cerebral blood flow mapping studies and for prophylactic anti-ischemic therapy may be considered on this basis </plain></SENT>
