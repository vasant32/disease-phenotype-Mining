<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this, Doppler signs of arterial spasm appeared as clinical manifestations 3-4 days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The linear velocity of middle cerebral arterial blood flow, which is critical for the development of ischemic complications of arterial spasm was 295 +/- 6 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude and duration of the excess critical level of the linear velocity of blood flow and the presence of arterial spasm in the contralateral hemisphere may determine whether the progressive ischemic symptoms are reversible or irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A further course of arterial spasm, development of ischemic complications and their outcomes may be predicted by the increasing gradient of the linear velocity in the cerebral arteries at days 4-6 of subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and the extent of spasm </plain></SENT>
