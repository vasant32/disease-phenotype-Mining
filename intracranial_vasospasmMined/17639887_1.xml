<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> configuration, the authors decided to delay surgery and instead undertook serial imaging studies of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient remained alert but developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Audiological examination and auditory brainstem responses suggested that the hearing disturbance was cortical in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography showed severe vasospasm in the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and moderate vasospasm in the left ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging was performed 2 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in the right insular cortex caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, particularly mean transit time mapping, revealed hypoperfusion in both temporal lobes including the auditory cortex and right auditory radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm was treated with induction of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011105'>hypervolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, 3D CT angiograms, and audiometry performed 2 weeks after the first examination showed recovery of vasospasm and resolution of perfusion abnormality and hearing disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On Day 26, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully occluded with clips and the patient was discharged with no deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of reversible cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260662" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">auditory dysfunction</z:e> purely due to bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> detected using perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging after SAH </plain></SENT>
