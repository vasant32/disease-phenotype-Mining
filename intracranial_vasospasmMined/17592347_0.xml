<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with vasospasm severity and rabbit neurologic status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurologic status of 20 New Zealand rabbits were graded initially and then, anesthetized and basal angiograms were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then 1.0 mL of CSF was withdrawn through cisterna magna and then 1 mL autologous arterial blood was injected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rabbits over 1 minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5 days, neurologic severity score (NSS) and vertebrobasilar angiograms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rabbits were repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbits without radiologic vasospasm or spasm under 50% (n=7) were termed as group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbits whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were 50% or over 50% (n=7) and NSS is lesser than 3 were termed as groups 2, and rabbits whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> were 50% or above 50% (n=7) and NSS is greater than 3 were termed groups 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 7, the CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> values of each group were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But when compared with only CSF baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> values groups 2 and 3 were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the NSSs were similar in groups 1 and 2, but group 3 significantly differed from groups 1 and 2 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups significantly differed from baseline NSSs (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data showed clearly that the degree of vasospasm correlates not only with neurologic status but also with CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CSF <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level may be useful as a surrogate marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> degree after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in clinics where invasive cerebral angiography could not be assessed for whatever reasons </plain></SENT>
