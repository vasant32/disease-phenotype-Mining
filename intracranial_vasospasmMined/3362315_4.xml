<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four female cynomolgous monkeys were randomized into three groups of 8: sham, clot, and clot + intrathecal nimodipine </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine was administered postoperatively by subcutaneous injection of 1 ml/0.2 mg tid for 6 days through an Ommaya reservoir with the catheter placed in the subarachnoid basal cisterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed on Day 7 post-SAH induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrathecally applied nimodipine was not effective in the prevention of angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
