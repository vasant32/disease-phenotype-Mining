<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rho-kinase (ROK)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction plays a pivotal role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> (CV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) induces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization through sequential activation of the Src family protein tyrosine kinases (Src-PTKs) and ROK in vitro, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> sensitization is inhibited by eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) through the selective inactivation of Src-PTK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether SPC induced CV in vivo, and, if it did, whether <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> would inhibit CV, as induced by SPC or in an in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Changes in the diameter of the canine basilar artery were investigated by angiography after administering SPC into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, Y27632, a specific Rho-kinase inhibitor, or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> was injected intracisternally and the effects of both agents were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another experiment using a single-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> model, Y27632 or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> was injected on day 7 after SAH and the changes in the diameter of the canine basilar artery were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 100 and 300 micromol/l, SPC induced severe vasoconstriction (maximum vasoconstriction by SPC (100 micromol/l): 61.8 +/- 8.2%), which was markedly reversed by Y27632 (96.3 +/- 4.4%) or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> (92.6 +/- 12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAH caused severe vasospasm on day 7 (67.6 +/- 7.8%), which was significantly blocked by Y27632 (95.5 +/- 10.6%) or <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> (90.0 +/- 4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SPC is a novel mediator of ROK-induced CV in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of CV induced by SPC or after SAH by <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> suggests beneficial roles of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> in the treatment of CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings are compatible with the notion that the SPC-ROK pathway may be involved in CV </plain></SENT>
