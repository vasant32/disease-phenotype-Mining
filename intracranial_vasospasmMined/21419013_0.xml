<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty four japanese white rabbits which ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries and no neurological deficits were randomized to sham-operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and nimodipine which injected of nimodipine 0.1 mg/kg, continuous vein administration 5 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavior scores, neurological scores were observed everyday and cerebral angiography changes were measured twice by 3D-CTA, and basilar artery was removed for pathological examination after last CTA examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In SAH group, The basilar artery were significantly vasoconstrictive on 5 days, neurological scores were increased, and the basilar artery was found <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-like changes under light microscopic and electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine group could not dilated the basilar artery arteriospasm after SAH, but it could attenuate neurological deficit, and obviously alleviate the pathological changes of basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nimodipine could not vasodilation of basilar artery in SCVS, but obviously could alleviate neurological changes and pathological changes of basilar artery in rabbits with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
