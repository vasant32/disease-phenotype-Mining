<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that an adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in producing the delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> which follows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results were as follows: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was produced by injection of fresh arterial blood into the cisterna magna in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> was shown angiographically to be biphasic in nature: immediate constriction lasting 1 h and marked prolonged spasm occurring between the 3rd and 5th day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (NA) and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity decreased over a period of 24 h both within the wall of the basilar artery and in the locus ceruleus and then gradually increased, reaching a maximum on the 3rd day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Topical application of spasmogenic substances (NA and blood) produced a marked constriction of the hypersensitive basilar artery on the 3rd day after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection into the cisterna magna produced prolonged vasocilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dilated vessel responded with mild transient constriction after the topical application of NA or fresh blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DBH activity and NA concentration in the vessels, locus ceruleus and medial hypothalamus decreased markedly on the 3rd day after the cisternal injection of 6-OHDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various spasmogenic substances (i.e. <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, NA, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> and methemoglobin) were measured in a mixture of equal volume of CSF and blood in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ONly the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> in the mixed fluid produced vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spasmogenic substances decreased markedly in the mixed fluid incubated for 3 days at 37 degrees C, and none of these substances apart from methemoglobin was present in a concentration sufficient to produce constriction of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that early spasm is induced by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> around the arteries of the cranial base, and delayed spasm might be caused by hyperreaction of cerebral vessels to spasmogenic substances such as methemoglobin, during the accumulation of excess NA in the cerebral vessel wall </plain></SENT>
