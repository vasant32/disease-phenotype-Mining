<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm developed between the 2nd and 8th days in the basal arteries, never on the first day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was classified as slight (over 120 cm/sec) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sever</z:e> (over 160 cm/sec) in the case of vasospasm lasting for several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development of vasospasm could be justified in 6 from 14 control angiographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Authors' observations are compared with some literary data of traumatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The theoretical significance and practical usefulness of transcranial Doppler sonography in the study and follow up of the blood flow of the injured brain, especially in traumatic vasospasm, are emphasized </plain></SENT>
