<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>Adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> has the potential to lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalances</z:e>, limit the body's ability to respond to stress, and worsen overall clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case series, we describe 16 patients evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Over a 2-year period, the medical records of 16 patients admitted to the adult neurosurgery service for aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> who were nonresponsive to vasopressor therapy and received cosyntropin for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> within 14 days of their event were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The median baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in this population was 22.5 microg/dL, with a poststimulation <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level of 31 microg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the population surveyed, a total of 11 patients met the preestablished criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo>, 3 with baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels of less than 15 microg/dL and 11 with poststimulation concentration changes of less than 9 microg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly correlated with hospital stay (P = 0.045), intensive care unit stay (P = 0.005), and ventilator days (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To date, this is the only investigation evaluating the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, 69% of the patients met the preestablished criteria for relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy in this population also needs review, as it could have significant implications for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
